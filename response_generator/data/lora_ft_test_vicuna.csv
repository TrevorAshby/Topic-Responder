102326	agent_1:oh, the music trend in Korea? yes, it sounds very culturally unique  agent_2:I would like to hear some examples of it.  agent_1:so would I! i wonder what they compliment ecah other about. fashion? hygiene?	agent_2:I am not sure. A judge delivered her ruling in the form of a rap for eminem ahah
138181	agent_2:That is awesome, and I'm sure they will do well there having gone through such a good program as this.  agent_1:They also did some assimilating to American culture.  They've also learned according to Zeng to push themselves more when about to quit. Zeng is one of their football players from China. agent_2:That is good advice and I'm sure they will use that going forward.  Are you a big NFL fan?	agent_1:Well, I like the Eagles but they are out of the playoffs sadly.
115092	agent_1:I sure do. Do you know who Reggie Miller is? agent_2:Yes I love the guy he is so good but did you know his sister is even better? agent_1:Yes she broke 8 national records once by scoring 105 points	agent_2:Yeah what a family with so much talent in it for the sport
6704	agent_1:yes but you need like 13745 plays just to make 7.25 a hour agent_2:I guess it depends on how many songs they had on there then,  to make 20 k lol agent_1:Do you use google ? 	agent_2:yes probably everyday lol how about u?
158057	agent_2:Wow that is an interesting requirement. The radio was very popular in the past but not so much anymore. There is even a station that translates solar activity into sound so you can listen live to the suns music. Would you listen? agent_1:Yeah, I would listen to that, but I thought it was for Jupiter?  agent_2:Oh interesting. Not sure. It would be fun to listen to both. Did you know one of the top radio acts of the 1930s was a ventriloquist? That is hard to for me to imagine because it doesn't seem like that would be entertaining!	agent_1:No, which one was it? Soldiers used to listen to the radio using a razorblade and pencil.
34438	agent_2:Pixar studio has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities agent_1:Yeah I did know about that!  I wonder what they have in there?   agent_2:Judge judy makes $123,000 per episode, making her the highest paid celebrity only after lebron james.	agent_1:Thats a nice paycheck !  Too bad for lebron lol Its been good chatting!
86630	agent_2:I wonder what flipped her? Was it Bill? agent_1:College does that to some people (also, affiliations have changed over time anyway).  agent_2:Agreed. Plus, when she campaignedd in the south, she adopted a southern accent so she is easily manipulated.	agent_1:I think that might be partially intentional too, and people's accepts do change.
141680	agent_1:No,  I dont have a problem with cars being stolen in my area.The car brand cadillac was named after french explorer antoine de la mothe cadillac who founded detroit.  agent_2:The flamethrower could come in handy in South Africa, where people use them to stop carjackings. Could come in handy in Detroit these days. agent_1:Im sure its illegal in the united states though	agent_2:The car is an important part of US culture, as is the telephone. Did you know that NY got the 212 area code because it's the fastest to dial on a rotary phone? I wonder whether kids know what that is.
125338	agent_1:Great fortune for the Post Office.  Regular mail volume goes down due to email and the Amazon package delivery volume increases a lot. agent_2:You are right, you are pretty intelligent. I happen to own a kindle fire, I just love it! you can read about somebodyÂ´s history, if they mention where they were, you can actually see the place, if they mention the music that they were listening, you can listen it, love it! marvellous gadget! agent_1:Wow!  I did not know that Kindle could do so much.  Our computing power is so great nowadays that we are only limited by our imagination.  It is surprising how much innovation comes from newer companies and the older ones try to keep selling buggy whips.	agent_2:Well, I highly recommend it to you, I was reading about Juana the Crazy, Queen of Spain and they  mentioned the Alhambra and the song that she was listening, and it makes you feel more into it. Nice to meet you, giving you an excellent.
79231	agent_1:That would be hard to make something like that. The javanese alphabet when recited in order forms a poem. agent_2:Very cool.  Did you know that vikings were warrior-poets? agent_1:I did not know that, but that's pretty cool. 	agent_2:Yeah it seems to funny that they were so tough and strong but yet poets at the same time.
89964	agent_2:That is a good idea for a reality show tv lol, they would try to kill each other like everyday, good thing the law is different now agent_1:ya I agree that would cause so much division, have you been to zimbabwe? The nickname for the president there is President Banana, is there a VP banana? haha agent_2:lol that would be funny maybe VP Platain, other countries sure have weird leaders, like the president of Indonesia	agent_1:haha VP Plantain, ya the Indonesian president made 3 pop albums, Trump needs to make a pop album with Kanye since theyre friends!
102810	agent_1:I am amazed at the company that did not buy FB when they had a chance. What were they thinking? agent_2:MySpace makes me feel old... probably still have a profile there too!  I wonder if they even had $75 mil in 2005? agent_1:Perhaps not, but I think they might have known some VC guys with that kind of cash.	agent_2:Agree - back then they were looking for the next tech boom while still gun shy from the first dot com crash.  FB was the first to be able to monetize the adverts and also, of  course, tracking users and sending them focused adverts
48113	agent_2:Very odd!  By the way, have you seen the new trailer for Aladdin?  I recently learned that Robin Williams as the genie in the animated version was really the first actor to start the trend of famous people doing voice overs.  agent_1:ya the new one looks horrible! do you think Robin ever got to visit the secret Pixar celeb room? agent_2:He must have at some point!  Sad what happened to him.  Some people have trouble dealing with fame and some people like an Ethiopian chef (encouraging people to combat hunger by eating more different foods) use their fame to try and make the world a better place.	agent_1:ya I agree, and others like Judge judy make 120k per episode and seem ok with it, very strange
97687	agent_2:Yes Tom Brady has shocked us all with his training agent_1:How much of his success do you think is training versus talent? agent_2:I think its about 70/30 talent. There is no way he would keep this up with bad conditioning.	agent_1:So, 70 talent?  Regardless, I get the sense that you've got to be at 100% on both sides to play in the NFL for long, and more so to set records and win championships.
126097	agent_1:Yeah since 1853 maybe that is why we always only hear fo those two parties agent_2:Hillary could be Trump's vice president before 1805 agent_1:yeah based on the fact that the vice president was always the runer up	agent_2:It would be interesting.  If Hillary was Trump's vice president, they might fight a lot.
40057	agent_1:I just did a 5K yesterday and I am beat. I was thinking I would love to work at an Amazon warehouse since they get their exercise in, walking between seven and fifteen miles a day. agent_2:That wouldn't be a bad way to get paid and get some exercise.  Especially in the winter months. agent_1:I know right. I would like to do it as a temporary job. Amazing how over a couple of decades ago most people had not heard of Amazon. The first Amazon customer spent $27.95 and got a building named after him.	agent_2:That's pretty neat!  I do like how Amazon has given opportunities to people who can work from home or deliver packages to make money working for themselves.  It's crazy to think just a few decades ago the internet was just getting started.
78500	agent_1:Probably yesterday lol, why do you ask? agent_2:Well, just to let you know it's a holdover from early evolution when land animals had both lungs, as well as gills.  Modern animals are clearly established in the fossil records as marine species.   agent_1:Oh wow, that is interesting and cool.  So crazy how things evolve over time. 	agent_2:Do you know the Loch Ness monster is a protected species?
14995	agent_2:Jazz is very intriquing as it maintained its core essence all the while abosorbing and drawing from different national, regional, and local cultures to adapt unique styles. Even in Korea, jazz bars are quite popular. agent_1:I wonder why growing goatees adds comfort to jazz trumpeters.  I played the trumpet, but I don't see the connection. agent_2:Perhaps it is a cultural phenomenon, a symbol of their art?	agent_1:Maybe Clint Eastwood understands as he has enjoyed jazz all his life.  I didn't know he played the piano
17039	agent_1:But if you are illiterate how can you read what Im writting now! just wondering lol, and yeah I do like to read, I dont always have the time though agent_2:I guess I'm a good guesser. I don't know. I were always called slow when I were young. I look to go to the library and look at the books. agent_1:That seems a bit messed up,well I like reading and wasnt great at it always so with enough hard work anyone can do it	agent_2:I'm giving it my all, but I just can keep up with how fast I type. I put the words on the screen, but I type too fast to read them all. If I went to prison, I would read all the time.
63288	agent_2:Yikes. That's kind of weird. Ha! But all this technology is amazing, especially considering all we can do today. Even phones have internet. We have actress Hedy Lamarr to thank for that as she invented Wi-Fi, GPS and cellphones back in the 1930s! agent_1:I had not heard of that or her i wonder why not. Do you know what Minnie Mouse is short for?  agent_2:Yeah and also, many people don't know there's really no correlation between connection quality and service bars either. To answer your question, I'm not sure. What does Minnie Mouse stand for?	agent_1:Minerva Mouse, just a fun fact, lol! Bill Nye was the science consultant for Disney's Flubber movie. Did you see that one with Robin Williams?
91527	agent_2:No, not really how did he get in? agent_1:all pretty girls were in drama class agent_2:I see, well it turned out pretty well for him, did you ever play Nintendo?	agent_1:I did it was so much fun. did you?
119233	agent_1:It truly was, as I preferred that platform over facebook. I think it's the sea of blue that turns me off of it. agent_2:I don't think you are the only one.  Do you know why everything is always blue on Facebook? agent_1:I heard it was something to do with Zuckerberg being colorblind, I could be wrong though.	agent_2:I think you are right now that you mention that.  I think I read that sometime that he was and that was the reason behind the blue blue blue.
57918	agent_2:Bet they are kicking themselves now no doubt. Facebook has 56 gender options that is ridiculous lol. agent_1:Wow way to cater to everyones preferences though!  That is considerate! agent_2:Agreed. The like button on facebook was almost named the awesome button if it were up to the facebook engineers!	agent_1:I like the awesome button way better than the like button lol
33487	agent_1:Well yeah baseball is a bat and ball game, a pitcher throws a ball, while a batter tries to hit it with the bat.  agent_2:Thanks. What is the job of the offensive team in baseball? agent_1:The object is for them to hit the ball and run around the bases to score runs. 	agent_2:Thank you. What does the runner touch in the end in order to score?
31131	agent_2:They would know what it's like to have things burn down. I wonder if they save all the terms of service that we all ignore when signing up for something or buying something? agent_1:Probably for the lawyers sake! I must confess I never read them. I wonder if they have a book on the cure for the constant clicking that can cause addition to novel activities? agent_2:I might need it if they do. You a Disney fan?	agent_1:I've enjoyed visiting Disney and I like to take my grandkids to some Disney movies. My kids watched Bill Nye the Science guy when they were young. He was the science consultant for Flubber movie!
75454	agent_2:I am, definitely. I prefer college basketball. Did you know that Tim Duncan actually turned down good money from the nba, and decided to stay in college for another 4 years? agent_1:haha no, do you know why he would do that? like why wouldn't you agree to play for the nba and make big bucks, cuz you are not paid when you play in college agent_2:I assume he wanted to pursue his education, and learn a little more, in case his NBA career didn't work out. That way, he'd have something to fall back on. what do you think?	agent_1:well that could make sense, I wonder what his degree was in, becuase I would imagine one year of the nba would cover many years of a regular job, but who knows haha
96123	agent_2:U2 probably got bored with the same old music and wanted to have some fun. I understand the desire for variety. They probably had enough money. agent_1:I didnt know country musician george strait and jeff bezos are cousins that is interesting fact.  agent_2:I wonder if Jeff is a fan of George's music, or if George gets a special deal at Amazon.	agent_1:Maybe lol its been fun chatting.
31819	agent_2:That does seem odd, maybe his no longer part of the network did you like the Simpsons? that was one of my favorite shows on the Fox channel agent_1:While Fox News and the Fox Channel are part of the same media empire, they are definitely no closely related siblings!  I wonder how they worked out the dispute in-house with regards to Fox News versus the Simpsons? agent_2:I think it was a threat, they didnt actually sue The Simpsons, they sure have a strange relatioship with the family, they wanted to sue them and then again they also wanted to give them their own channel	agent_1:Yep, a bit like Sean Hannity going after AOC!  What are your thoughts about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?
97797	agent_2:Haha, well maybe he just ages faster. Supposedly he drove at age three. agent_1:Wow.  Living the accelerated life.  At 3 Im pretty sure I still fell over while walking. agent_2:Haha. Well Kim John Un is sexy right? The Onion made fun of him and voted him as sexist man alive and China believes it.	agent_1:Lol.  Totally.  The Onion is a great source of news.  Lets hope they keep thinking that.
116993	agent_2:Yeah. Do you know how the VP used to be elected? agent_1:Yes that was just the runner up, which is fair enough agent_2:Yeah I agree. DO you like Kanye  West?	agent_1:Somewhat he can be strange. He thinks AIDS is man-made
132304	"agent_1:Yea, I like his films from the 80s, so much funnier than Jack Black, so happy he was never in Green Lantern agent_2:I never saw that movie, but if Murray's in it I should. You know he likes to walk up to strangers in restaurants and eat food off their plates, and say ""no one will ever believe you""? agent_1:Lol no but that sounds like something Bill Murray would do"	"agent_2:I saw him crash a TV weathercast once in a giant cowboy hat and start doing his own impromptu ""forecast,"" and it was hilarious."
127706	agent_1:Are you a football fan? agent_2:Hi there friend. Yes I enjoy watching football. I like watching the game on TV because it's more comfortable and I can clearly see where the first down marker is. agent_1:That's how I like watching it too. Did you know that ESPN won an emmy for that yellow line?	agent_2:I think it's well deserving it totally changed the way football is watched. The highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when Georgia Tech defeated cumber land  222 to 0.
22685	"agent_1:Yeah, i""m not sure if I really believe that about the evolution aspect. My understanding is things just get out of sync internally. agent_2:Yea, I wonder what evidence they have that hiccups occur because of having both lungs and gills, seems impossible to test that agent_1:Agreed. Did you know that under the provisions of the 1912 socttish protection of animals act, the loch ness monster is a protected species?"	agent_2:No, I didn't even know Loch Ness sightings dated back to 1912 but it's nice to know it's protected if it turns out to be real
19079	agent_1:I don't really follow it. Apparently the Vegas Golden Knights did well last season. agent_2:Yes, they made the finals.  agent_1:They got a ton of support from their fans. There were 18,042 fans on average at their home games	agent_2:That's crazy, I've seen that's over capacity of their arena
161453	agent_2:Maybe you can look it up on Youtube!  Youtube has everything lol  agent_1:Yeah, I probably could! I just learned that the three wealthiest presidents are jfk, washington and jefferson. I'll have to Google that to confirm.  agent_2:I saw that too,  but Im pretty sure its Trump,  then Washington and then Jefferson.  i hear the president guest house is bigger than the white house	agent_1:Yeah, I would love to be a guest there.
130670	agent_1:Yeah.. that is awesome!  I wonder if their governemnt is commendable to it's own people? agent_2:Who knows, but I would hope so for their sake! agent_1:Yeah me too!  Great chat... you are very fast :)	agent_2:Thank you, you as well, have a great night!
124392	agent_2:Right. I think we need a lot from other nations as well, more than he thinks. agent_1:He's got some great ideas about America being great but that doesn't mean we have to do it alone.  Diplomacy is super important agent_2:Yes, some even think it's not America First, but America Alone. That is a scary thought.	agent_1:For sure.  we definitely don't want to be viewed as, or in reality be, alone and weak
121129	agent_2:I know, I often have keen sense for a team based on a name, even if it is not  closely associated to me. agent_1:i actually havent played football in awhile, i may go try and play a game today agent_2:Where I live now not many people play soccer, plus I'm getting a bit too old.  I think I'd have to buy some new soccer shoes also if I were to play again.	agent_1:oh good point, i gotta go get some shoes before the store closes! nice chatting with you!
34853	agent_1:He must take that very seriously. The items in the game are apparently not random agent_2:Mario Kart games were launched in 1992 and the most recent was released on April 2017 agent_1:SO they have been around for a while. Nintendo as a company was founded in 1889	agent_2:I was surprised to learn that, they have been around more than 100 years, they were once a toy company.
75253	agent_2:I live near Akron and drive through it often.. Now that I think of it I'd want to stay well away from there water, not the cleanest of places.  I hear the US supreme court has its own court. agent_1:I am sure it isn't lol. I heard they have a special name for the court but can't remember agent_2:Since the Wizards are in Washington I wonder if they ever use it, the Wizards versus the justices would be a good game.	agent_1:They should have that be a yearly thing, I think it would be awesome lol. It was so nice chatting with you!
2645	"agent_2:I didn't, but I know it is by the same author, Gillian Flynn. The author wrote Sharp Objects because she wanted to explore how women aren't innately good and was sick of literature's tendency to portray women as spunky girls or bad girls like tramps and vamps. agent_1:lynn's novels are feminist precisely because they aim a megawatt beam, bright as prison lights, into the dark corners of women's minds and lives agent_2:I think you can really see this in the first line of Sharp Objects, where she write that ""I was never a good little girl."" Amy Dunne in Gone Girl was the same way."	agent_1:There's a wiki which ranks fictional characters according to their powers and abilities.
71460	agent_2:That is awesome.  Did you know that the first interracial kiss to be aired on tv was on Star Trek? agent_1:Yes, The show was very forward thinking. They had a crew made up of many different races and everyong, for the most part were portrayed as good and competent people. agent_2:Yeah I agree with you on that.  Speaking of television, do you watch the show Shark Tank?	agent_1:Only occasionally, and it has been a very long time. I think it is a pretty interesting show though.
83807	agent_1:I agree. Did you know that the three horizontal line menu on apps and websites is called a hamburger button? agent_2:No idea it was called like that, what I did know is that you can get signal on top of Mount Everest. agent_1:That is very shocking. I can't imagine that there are towers anywhere close. Apparently the library of Alexandria has a saved copy of the internet in case the internet burns down. I can't imagine how much storage that would take. 	agent_2:It must take quite a bit and its refreshing to know there is backup in that library, would you imgaine the consequences of the internet being down?
30607	agent_1:He didnt? wow, I bet the scouts were blind or maybe he improved later, agent_2:Believe it or not he only had the 4th highest salary on the Warriors in 2015. agent_1:I bet his the highest player on the team by now, he is the star of the team after all	agent_2:I bet you're right.  The team he plays for the Golden State Warriors relocated to the San Francisco Bay area in 1962 from Philadelphia.
44822	agent_2:They have a keen sense of smell, maybe 1000 times better than ours. Plus they have a dozen blood types. agent_1:They, like elephants, also instinctively understand pointing.  agent_2:Never had a pet elephant though. Too expensive. Plus hard to clean up after on the street.	agent_1:LOL. They could help with the heavy lifting.  Dogs are probably the better choice since years of human cohabitation has made them attuned to human behavior.
50385	agent_1:Yeah, I guess they are picky about their shows. Well, I enjoyed chatting with you! Have a good day! agent_2:What do you think of Bill Murray?  It's been a pleasure! agent_1:He has some odd opinions about comedy. But he is quirky.	agent_2:Yes. I agree. Have a good one!
62258	agent_1:No I didn't!  Do animal hospitals have a lot of blood in storage for operations then?   agent_2:I would imagine so, they do have dog blood drives agent_1:I am really glad to hear that!  I've never seen a dog blood drive before but I hope too. I worry about injured dogs and what happens if they need blood.	agent_2:Me too, it's nice to know in Istanbul they have vending machines that feeds the city's stray dogs
57336	agent_1:Really?  I like books a bunch but like exercise too.  Reading is a complex brain process decoding symbols into meaning when you think about it. Challenging for some. agent_2:Do u speed read? The world record for speed reading is held by anne jones, with a reading speed of 4,700 words per minute agent_1:Not really, but I'm pretty fast so maybe?? i wouldn't know how you tell.  Reading can be an escape for some but different for different people how they see things or don't see things	"agent_2:i do audible mostly,  I can listen anywhere its so convienent.  Cs lewis and tolkien held ""you laugh you lose"" competitions when reading terrible poetry"
31973	agent_2:It has been a long time since Amazon started up....they even named a building at corporate after their first customer. agent_1:Really? That's pretty cool. They definitely seem to have it all figured out and growing and growing, I don't pay for Prime but I guess if I want to watch sports in the future or watch a baseball game I will have to join lol...I heard also that IMBD is owned by Amazon...didn't know that! agent_2:I hope Disney does not agree to sell.  They are a much better organization.  Did you know that Frozen was the first animation directed by a woman?	agent_1:I agree! But there are other companies who want to buy this Disney Broadcasting Network so bidding is just in the first stages. I love Disney though, and no I didn't know that! I like how the toy industry gets involved in Disney films prior to even before starting the production.
151945	agent_1:I'm sort of surprised by that. But I don't see Brady doing a lot of endorsements which is odd.  agent_2:Yes.  I think she's one of the most demanded top models in the world.  Brady is considered the biggest steal in the history of the NFL draft due to him being selected in the 6th round. agent_1:I can believe it. I'm not surprised he's done well. He doesn't get injured very much. 	agent_2:No he doesn't.  What's funny...speaking of injuries...Bill Belichick lists Brady on the injury report every week even though he is fine.  Probably to mess with who they are playing that week.
164359	agent_1:They made more money really? I guess that score makes more sense now, did you hear about the Emmy ESPN won back in the day? agent_2:I haven't heard about that, how did they manage that? agent_1:They won the Emmy because of the creation of the yellow first down line, anyway its been great chatting with you. 	agent_2:Interesting! Nice chatting with you too!
48702	agent_2:Yeah I would hate law school! Do you like the Internet? Apparently it can actually be addictive in the brain! agent_1:I do like the internet,  I use it all the time.  I believe that,  I wonder if they offer support groups for that kind of addiction.  agent_2:Yeah I wonder! It's definitely not recognized as a real addiction I think in today's world but if they can see addiction in the brain then I'm sure it's real, you know?	agent_1:yeah.  Did you know the 3 horizaontal line menu on apps is called a hamburger button ?
36571	agent_1:I know! The correlation between our anatomy and animals is pretty neat. Did you know that the study of animals is called Zoology? agent_2:Yeah, I remember taking Zoology in school.  Did you know that there are over 7 million animal species? agent_1:That's pretty wild. I have recently learned that there are about 20 quintillion individual animals on earth, that is astonishing!	agent_2:That is amazing!  I was shocked to learn recently that there are some animals that can theoretically live forever, because they are biologically immortal.
53439	"agent_1:I heard he was an outstanding dancer and won an award in Hong Kong in a Cha-Cha championship.  Having such good coordination from being a martial arts champion must carry over to dance.  I am not much of a dancer myself, but do like the arts.  Did you know ballet dancers can go thru 4 pairs of shoes a week? agent_2:I did not know that but i guess it makes since always walking on the toes. Hey Michael Jackson has a patent.  agent_1:He obviously had his own dance style, like the ""Moonwalk"",  What was the patent for?"	agent_2:The lean he did, the only person i ever seen do it that far out was Jamie Foxx.
15888	"agent_2:Yes. They can be as intrusive as they want. agent_1:I wonder what they'd make of me if I start playing ""All I Want For Christmas"", constantly in March.  They'd probably just think I was a lunatic. agent_2:Or maybe that you were thinking ahead."	agent_1:Maybe I should really think ahead and get my Holiday shopping done now, play that song, and put up the tree.
75098	agent_1:lol  I couldn't even imagine.  Imagine what they would have done if they had the internet. agent_2:haha ya they would have been very shocked, do you ever read poetry btw? agent_1:I haven't but would like to start at some point.  I think I would start with the poem that when read normally is depressing, but when read backwards is inspiring.	agent_2:ya that sounds pretty cool actually, have you heard of the Japanese alphabet? When you read the letters out in order it actually makes a poem of sorts
127790	agent_2:I've never been to the east coast besides Florida if you consider it. I flew out of Florida before last year's hurricane a couple days before it hit. agent_1:How did you travel to Florida, by airplane I presume?  did you know the Dutch are working on a commuter bus that can travel 160 mph. agent_2:By Airplane yes. Yes I saw that. I didn't realize All of japans highways are tolls, and it costs more than 300$ to travel across the country.	agent_1:I guess there isn't much traveling in Japan huh.  those tolls are expensive.  There is one island that has banned motorized vehicles for over a hundred years now.
107088	agent_2:A handy thing to know, the little arrow next to the pump symbol  on the dash tells you what side of the car the gas cap is on. agent_1:I just found that out not too long ago! Never really looked. Maybe I did, but didn't notice. Now I do, thinking a lot of people may not notice too! agent_2:I don't know were I picked that one up, but it's surprising how many people do not know that. What do you think of self driving cars?	agent_1:I'm not sure about that! I enjoy driving a car so that would take it away!!  Also I heard it had an acceleration button or something! OMG!! what a ride! scary!!lol
90619	agent_2:Has Pokemon ever gotten an Emmy? I learned all I know about politics from watching the 750 Pokemon episodes. agent_1:You are dedicated beyond belief!  I don't know.  Animation can have some staying power without the characters getting old.  The last Family Guy episode attracted flowers from the Simpsons crew. agent_2:Toons are great, but what makes them come alive are the voices of the actors. Like THomas the Tank Engine, which was narrated by great voice artists such as George Carlin, Ringo Starr, and Alec Baldwin. 	agent_1:The are so many identifiable voices.  Is you PhD in a field where you could have an opinion about the power output of the sun?  I have heard that it produces enough energy for the earth in one second that would last 500000 years.
60001	agent_2:kindle is great. One cna read a lot faster. not speed reading fast like anne jones' 4700 words/min, but fast nonetheless agent_1:Thats is unbelievable,  that is way too many words lol agent_2:yeah, one wonders if you can keep a sense of creativity and critical analysis reading that fast	agent_1:Yeah,  it doesnt seem like you can actually understand or process what the reading material is about.
153037	agent_1:I am not at all surprised. Talking about basketball, James Naismith was the inventor of basketball. agent_2:Yeah, and hes the only losing coach in the university of kansas,  ironic.  agent_1:Yes, terrible irony! The Supreme Court has a basketball court on the top floor.	agent_2:Thats really cool,  I wonder if they let visitors in.
92006	agent_2:How long has the technology of driverless cars been around less than 10 years there is still a very long way to go agent_1:It's inevitable that there will be accidents. I can only imagine there were problems, and accidents way back in 1886 when Karl Benz built the first automobile. agent_2:Do you know what the brand Cadillac is named after?	agent_1:I think it was a Frenchman, explorer Antoine De La Mothe.  Think he founded Detroit also.
71695	agent_2:True.They must be super long to have to cross an entire ocean. And talking about rotary phones, remember the phone book and how useful they were once? agent_1:Yeah. They were thick too! I just got one and it was like 1/2 an inch thick. It went right into the garbage... agent_2:Yeah not sure why they still make them, it seems like everything is digital now. There must be people who still use them. Apparently you cannot separate two of them if their pages overlap	agent_1:With the advent of the iPhone phone books are obsolete. They have more computing power than the entire US ICBM detterent. Seems kind of shaky.
109010	agent_1:ya I don't follow sports, but I did see the superbowl, pretty boring, I guess games only have about 11 mins of actual gameply agent_2:Yeah, maybe if some women played I'd be more interested. They would be allowed but none have met eligibility requirements yet. agent_1:ya its weird that they can play if theyre good enough, I think we will see a female player eventually	agent_2:So it looked like the Patriots grip was slipping and the Jaguars appeared to be prying them away. But the Patriots still made it to the Super Bowl.
2627	agent_2:Yes.  Boas and some others give live birth. agent_1:Well that's creepy.  It's as creepy as knowing there are some snakes that can fly. agent_2:Yikes!  I don't want to see those.  Not even in a zoo.  lol  When snakes are born with 2 heads, they fight each other food.  That's creepy too.  Is that a common thing with snakes?????	agent_1:i don't know. That does seem really weird to picture a snake fighting itself.
126795	agent_1:lol  In 2008, the Norwegian government donated $1 billion dollars to help save the Amazon rainforest.  That's a nice thing to see. agent_2:They did? that is such a nice thing to do, saving the world one rainforest at the time specially with so many cars out there polluting the planet.  agent_1:I agree.  The first patent for a car was issued in 1886 to Karl Benz.  Didn't know they were working on them that early.	agent_2:I didnt know that I thought it was a Ford, in fact the Ford Model T, but its nice to know I was wrong.
58125	agent_2:Did you know that the manager is allowed to play in the gam. That why they wear a uniform. agent_1:Yep, but of course if absolutely necessary. Some of them aren't in the best shape! agent_2:Lol. that is true. I never really played baseball. I played kickball or as the canadians like to call it soccer baseball.	agent_1:Yeah, i loved kickball i played it as a kid in elementary school
42386	agent_2:That's a very good point you bring up. Back in the 20th century when cars first came into Global use it caused a dependent on them for developed economies. I can't even imagine our economy without cars! agent_1:neither can I. i hope that we get more public transport to reduce the traffic, but we need cars! anyway, great chat! agent_2:Agree with you 100%. If you need practice driving play the video game gran turismo because it seems to be very realistic. Great chatting with you as well. Enjoy this glorious day!	agent_1:Ok, will do! Gran turismo. Ill check it out. Have a good day!
153482	agent_1:Yes, I really enjoy using it. I think the library has grown to more than just books and digital items. I think it has become more of a central part of a community. agent_2:It make the habit of reading and in ancient Greece also have a library. agent_1:I know a librarian and she cares more about the peopple in her library than just about anyone I know cates about things.	agent_2:Most of the US teenagers use the library very frequently. Library is also collection books range from singe to several books.
86533	agent_1:Well the whole government is a bit of a joke right now so they might as well make puns about it. I can't imagine that court gets used much.  agent_2:Haha. Can't argue with that. Segueing into music, do you like Jazz? I heard trumpeters have goatees so its easier to play.  agent_1:I don't mind Jazz. It is a bit freeform for my taste. I would have thought the facial hair would get in the way of playing. 	agent_2:As a trumpet player, I can say it would be more so the metal of the mouthpiece would feel better on the lips.
52408	agent_2:Ya you have to build up calluses on your hands, it kind of sucks, thats why I like piano haha, I didn't know there's a Guiness record for most guitar smashes, that seems so wasteful agent_1:Seriously, those instruments are expensive.  I guess some people have money to waste! agent_2:Do you like van halen? I think this awesome he actually set the studio speakers on fire when playing a song, thats so awesome haha	agent_1:Not really a fan but that does sound pretty awesome.  Have you ever listened to radio dramas?  It sounds so interesting.  I heard there's a website where you can listen for free.  Need to research that.
71795	"agent_2:I am going to start calling them that. That is pretty funny. Did you know the creator of Atari created Chuck E Cheese? Apparently he wanted kids to play more Atari ""cathode ray tube amusement devices."" Haha. agent_1:haha I didn't know that, I think his name is Noah Bushnell, I went to Chuck E Cheese as a kid and that place was awesome, they should make a new one but for adults only haha agent_2:Yeah, they should. Have you been to Dave and Busters? That's quite fun and geared towards adults but pricey compared to Chuck E Cheese."	agent_1:that's true, I have been there but I want some animatronic animals! maybe even a mascot that walks around and hands out free drinks, now that would take Dave and Buster's to the next level!
158197	agent_2:I know they live in the White House! agent_1:Did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house? agent_2:Nice. Is that also true in Ireland and France, where they have twin White House buildings?	agent_1:Yeah but I do wonder if they presidents live in those houses or not
68180	agent_1:Nope I don't either. I did not even read the terms when I subscribed to Netflix back in 1997 when it started. agent_2:Netflix is a great service. i stopped it a few years ago to cut expenses. great content agent_1:Yes, between Netflix and YouTube they make up half of peak internet traffic in North America.	agent_2:boy, folks sure are addicted to their video content. i guess i am part of the problem there too though
42990	agent_1:It's funny that they are advanced enough to have solar panels but still use floppy discs.  agent_2:Who, the White House? LOL agent_1:Yeah! Apparently they still use floppy discs to store some files!	agent_2:That is so insane. I wonder why?
3443	agent_1:Love hats, all kinds my friend. How about you?  agent_2:Yep I do also!  Fun little fact about in the Old West, the Cowboy hat was not the most popular.  The Bowler hat was, whichever that looks like! agent_1:Yeah police wear distinct hats usually peaked caps or brimmed hats, like the mounties. 	agent_2:Yep their hats are noticeable!  Another fun fact I learned is a chefs funny hat they wear are called Toque!
9571	agent_1:Oh, okay.  I accept your explanation.   agent_2:Did you know astronauts voted from space. Not surprising when you consider some other voters are lost in space. agent_1:Yes, I heard.  I don't how how they do it though because they cannot just say it to the people on the ground.	agent_2:That's a good point. Did you hear that Austin Texas voted to rename their garbage dump after fred durst. I wonder what he did?
103315	agent_2:i was suprised to hear lacrosse was so popular in canada as it is recently gaining popularity here in the US.  I have never heard of bandy hockey. agent_1:Bandy hockey, what is that?  In the first Olympic winter games, Canada scored 132 goals and only let 3 in.  That was in 1924. agent_2:no idea either.  I am interested in radio technology more than hockey too.  strangley Jupiter has radio frequency storms so loud they can be heard with a HAM radio on earth	agent_1:Wow, that must be really loud.  In Canada, radio stations must play at least 40% Canadian music, by law.
44672	agent_1:Yeah specially if you have twins or more kids at home, it can turn into a real nightmare lol agent_2:Double trouble! Yes, the energy it takes to parent is incredible. i think that working and parenting at the same time is tough. agent_1:Its hard work but its worth it, my kids drive me nuts at times but then the love I feel for them grows with time and wouldnt imagine my life without them. 	agent_2:Yeah, kids need parenting and i think that it is important to be there because you dont know when they will need you.
33049	agent_2:I agree that Pink Floyd is excellent.  The concert was in 1972, so the recording quality might not be too good. agent_1:Ya that is true, I wish that kind of music were still popular, modern music isn't as good in my opinion, it's all done on computers and people don't play real instruments as much, there is no modern equivalent to Pink Floyd or Led Zeppelin agent_2:I hear you.  I also like Queen and the Eagles.  Those concerts must be exhausting. Linkin Park played 324 in one year.	agent_1:Yup I like those bands too, that is crazy, also crazy that the Ramones played a total of 2,263 concerts over a period of 20 years, that is so many concerts
76746	agent_2:Do you have a favorite Shakespeare play that enjoy? agent_1:So, I am less than enthusiastic because I took a Shakespeare course in college and ended up liking his works less than I did initially because the professors who team-taught it presented opposing interpretations.  But a Polish composer liked Hamlet so much that he donated his skull to the Royal Shakespeare Company in hopes that it would be used as the skull of Yorick--talk about being a fan! agent_2:Oh wow, I would be really interested in classes where the professor takes an opposing view contrary to what everyone thinks. That's really impressive, I recently read that more football players who have passed are donating their skulls for research as well. I think there is an association between head injuries and behavior with football	agent_1:Football is definitely tough (physically) on the brain. I imagine one would struggle with a Shakespeare play after a few major concussions, maybe even making a phone call!
48429	agent_1:Cousins seems to be adjusting quickly and getting back to form. It will be hard to knock them off in the playoffs. Even Lebron doesn't have enough help on the Lakers to do it.  agent_2:Yeah I don't think Lebron has nearly enough fire power to beat them.  I think the Nuggets look like a tough matchup for them.  agent_1:Nuggets have been really surprising but I don't know if I see them beating the Warriors in 7. Possibly Toronto or Milwaukee from the east could give them a run. 	agent_2:Yeah I am really hoping Milwaukee can reach the finals, they are my favorite team.  Do you follow any team?
123724	agent_1:I think it somehow picks up the sounds of the storms there on Jupiter and other places in outer space too and then it makes the sounds into music. I think I'd be interested in hearing the storms unedited, too! What about you? agent_2:I would love to hear it, might be soothing. agent_1:I like how in Canada their radio station must play at least 40% Canadian music. Good spirit!	agent_2:Interesting. Theres also a site to listen to classic radio dramas free
126254	agent_1:It would seem that there are more winners and losers than just the team on the field.  ESPN and the NFL it self are money generating companies.  The talent like Benjarvus green-Ellis wins or looses. agent_2:Yeah, I agree with you.  Do you know he never fumbled a ball his entire career?  That's what needs an award. agent_1:Right, he takes the risk and does an amazing thing.  It is funny to think that soccer has more fans and makes more money than football, basketball, baseball, golf, tennis and hockey combined.	agent_2:Yeah, it is hard to believe but it is so popular in the rest of the world, I can see it being a big money maker.In the 1960s the top bowlers in the US made twice as much as the top football stars.  Times change.
118185	agent_2:Yes he was a smart killer.  The case was never solved. agent_1:Its kind of crazy that he believed that the people he killed would be his slaves in the afterlife. agent_2:I had not heard that one.  The killer killed people in different ways - from execution style to how he killed young couples.	agent_1:I think that was the key part that made it hard to catch him.
134462	agent_1:did you know that the norwegian governemtn donated a billion dollars to help the amazon rainforest? agent_2:No.  Please tell me more about it. agent_1:yeah, they did that in 2008, I think it's crazy that they would send that much money to a cause like that instead of using it in their own country, but they must think it was important	agent_2:To which government  did they send the money to? I also heard that the government planned to destroy wikilieaks.
121397	agent_2:It was funny when Bruno tweeted a picture of a hat and a lunchbox to Musk in an attempt to fight back. agent_1:I agree. Musk is a citizen of the US, Canada and South Africa. agent_2:I wish he would run for president! He is just as smart if not smarter than the only president to have a PhD which is Woodrow Wilson.	agent_1:Musk started on a PhD himself.  He dropped our after 2 days to start his first company.
95031	agent_1:I agree with you. anne Jones holds the world record for speed reading, which is 4700 words per minute, there's no way she can retain anything from that agent_2:Probably a general impression. Not so useful for reading comprehension. Maybe she could use it to win contests, is all. agent_1:Yes I agree. Have you ever seen the movie Starship Troopers? Or read the book?	agent_2:I read the book when I used to be able to read it page after page. Then movies came along for me so I put the books away. I've seen Starship Troopers.
22342	agent_2:Some of these track kids are amazing. This kid Ethan Fogle did 500 meters in 1:05.31. agent_1:WOW! That is fast. Did you know a hockey player was traded for $1 in 1993?  agent_2:Sound like what I would be worth.  Another track kid, Donovan Louis did 55 meters in 6.43 seconds and a long jump of 24-3.25. What an athlete. 	agent_1:Well apparently that player went on to win 4 Stanely Cups.
108363	agent_2:Very true, he has had several bankruptcies. agent_1:Yeah that makes me wonder if he has that much money after all, did you hear about the first president of Zimbawe and his funny nickname? agent_2:Actually his real last name was Banana.  I couldn't believe it so I had to look it up.	agent_1:Yeah his fist name is Cannan, I though it was a nickname but no, his real name
106346	agent_1:Ya I would imagine.  What are your thoughts on computers? agent_2:I think they are a great tool if used appropriately. They can be really addicting though.  agent_1:Very true.  Someone built a working 16-bit computer using nothing but minecraft building blocks.  That person must have been very talented. 	agent_2:That is cool. People build computers out of some neat things. I saw one that was entirely clear plastic once. It was awesome to see all the inner parts.
38578	agent_1:Yeah, the super extended directors special edition or whatever? i dont know the novels, and the movie was a bit confusing. The Expanse? ok, i'l check it out. Anyway, great chat! agent_2:I think there's a bit more to go. There was a Dune miniseries, I think. agent_1:Ok, ill look for that. thanks for the tip! Anyway, great chat! Have a good evening!	agent_2:You too!
128651	"agent_1:Okay, Animals are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that form the biological kingdom Animalia agent_2:Thats cool. Animals, like humans, have a dominant ""paw"" or side agent_1:Do you think animals will understand humans?"	"agent_2:Depends on how you communicate I guess. Animals from geographically distant areas often speak different ""languages"" or ""dialects."""
157248	agent_2:I used to like 49ers since I lived in San Francisco for 25 years.  Now, I have no favorite. agent_1:How come you don't like the team anymore? do you like the Patiots? agent_2:49ers has not been very good in the last few years.  it's rather boring.  I am old.  I liked Joe Montana.  I admire the Patriots but I'm not a fan.	agent_1:I hate the Patriots but I have to give it to them, what a team, they are making history in the NFL
58907	agent_1:The piano is a great instrument. You cannot build one out of a fireplace I think. Brian May is always up to something. agent_2:Yeah he can even play the guitar with a coin, he's very talented, did you know that you can use a dial toneto  tune your guitar? agent_1:Oh, yes I guess the tone is the same everywhere. That is a good idea. I think you'd have to have good ears though.	agent_2:Yep I could see that. Do you know how to read by the way? Apparently Braille, which was invented by a fifteen-year-old, is used by the blind in order to read
126808	agent_2:No, unfortunately I can't do that.  It's kinda like the Washington DC situation where there are security concerns about accessing internet with sensitive material.   agent_1:Nice. I can once in a while and I find myself more efficient and effective becuase I do not want to loose the privledge... agent_2:Well, it certainly saves on the commuting by car	agent_1:It takes me 30 minutes to drive each way so when I do work from home, I spend an additional hour working instead of driving.
83435	"agent_1:I agree.  It a long way off or even unlikely that a computer will every have a ""soul"".  Well, its been nice chatting with you.  The weathers nice today.  So I am going to hop on the bicycle and start the 10 mile ride to work.   agent_2:Ok. Yeah it has been nice trading facts with you today. Hope everything goes well for you.  agent_1:Same to you.  Take care."	agent_2:Bye buddy.
6399	agent_2:No more helium balloons? Aww... agent_1:I know, but maybe it is for the better. do you like animals agent_2:I don't really like them as pets but in nature yes. It's sad that the dodo bird is extinct. I hope we stop destroying the earth and habitats for animals. The dodo bird was actually a sub family of pigeon.	agent_1:Yeah and I think it was a nice looking bird. I hope so too. their bones are lighter than their feathers
22934	agent_2:I like casual attire too. Did you know apple had a clothing line in 1986 agent_1:I cant imagine. who would wear those clothes back then? programmers? geeks? LOL agent_2:Right lol, I wonder how bad it was if it was just one year. I am sure you can get some on ebay lol	agent_1:I bet you could. show off to your fellow geeks and programmers! classic style! anyway, great chat!
69988	agent_1:Are you really immortal though? your body would die and I'd think your knowledge would become uselesss with advancements. agent_2:i guess you could add to your knowledge as a virtual being. I wonder what the point would be. we should as mark zuckerberg what it is like to be a cyborg. agent_1:have you seen bohemian rhapsody? did you know the guitarist brian may has a phd in astrophysics?	agent_2:i had heard that. the guy is a genius, very gifted. i saw the film. it was pretty good, but i did like the performance by Rami.
77857	agent_2:Yeah, no comparison between German and American back then. agent_1:I'd be interested in buying a South African car with a flame-thrower equipped to it agent_2:As longs as you are not in Ohio, illegal to warm up a car	agent_1:Sounds like a law Ohio would pass. Did you know that McDonalds added drive-thrus in 1975 for soldiers who couldn't leave their cars in fatigues?
88402	agent_2:Allen Iverson negotiated a pretty good deal with Reebok. He gets $800k a year until he's 55. The he gets $32 million. agent_1:What is he going to do with all that money? start his own shoe company? LOL agent_2:Haha. He's set for life, at least. A lot of athletes blow through their money quickly after they stop playing.	agent_1:true. they need help with money management. Anyway, great chat!
72994	agent_1:ya do you think earth days will get longer over time? Will we have a 30 hour day eventually? agent_2:Could happen, omg! that would be weird., So is that its possible to have in your car a flame-thrower legally . agent_1:yes it is if you're in south america! I could use that right now for the snow haha	agent_2:Ha, ha, ha, yes! So the name of the car brand Cadillac was from a french explorer.
106789	agent_2:Haha, good question.  He had to have chosen it.  I would vote for Banana!  Speaking of which, astronauts cast their votes from space! agent_1:Yeah, that is the principle of democracy, everyone gets to vote, even if you are in the middle of the jungle.  agent_2:Well, sort of.  34% of the black male population in Alabama can no longer vote.  I wonder why, incarceration?	agent_1:Yeah, if you are convicted, you lose your right to vote, it should not be like that.
41353	agent_2:No, I didn't know that. Seems appropriate though. It is illegal to warm up your car in Ohio?  agent_1:so funny. I have not heard that! McDonalds actually invented the drive thru for servicemen that were not supposed to get out of their cars in fatigues. agent_2:That is nice of them to take care of the troops. Audi had to beef up their horns in india for increased use. Wow!	agent_1:Have not heard that! Trunks are called trunks because originally people carried wooden trunks on the back of their truck.
40262	agent_2:He did? well its a good thing he chose rap, I love his songs agent_1:I know.  I'm going to have some of those songs now in my head for the rest of the day.  lol agent_2:Then you can also imagine the ruller of a judge from Michigan, she delivered her rulling by rapping her decision, Eminem was present	agent_1:LOL  That would have been funny to hear!
143699	agent_2:Yea, it's hard to find anything funny anymore agent_1:Yeah its crazy.  I cant watch it at all.  Its too sad.  agent_2:Yea, last time it was on I flipped the channel to Evan Almighty, which happens to be the most expensive comedy ever made	agent_1:Seriously?  Thats interesting.  I wonder why.  Do they use a lot of cgi or something?
31576	"agent_2:Her sales have been amazing with 27 million albums and 146 million singles as of January 2016 and she is still going strong.  I find it interesting the breadth of her musical styles, including branching out into Electronic Dance Music (EDM). agent_1:That really is a lot of sales. Hard to believe she's been very popular since 2008. It does not seem that long. agent_2:And, her reach is international with the lead single from the movie ""Shallow"" topped the charts in seven countries!  I guess I really need to check her out!"	agent_1:I guess I do too! It was nice chatting with you today. Have a good day!
110661	agent_1:Have you ever heard of Reel big fish, never heard of them.  agent_2:No, or any of their stuff but i am glad the dark side of the moon album is still appreciated agent_1:Yes it is very Haunting, perhaps Pink Floyd can cover some of Reel big fish hahah.	agent_2:or the NWA, it would make straight out of compton different
163487	agent_1:Did you hear about Barbara Alston died recently, she was 74 agent_2:I am actually not sure who she is?  Was she an actress?  I was just reading about the fact that after WWII an improved version of black and white became popular.   agent_1:No she's a famous singer, she was in the group the crystals, they made that song Da Do Ron Ron, I think everyone knows that one haha	agent_2:Oh yes, thats a fun song.  Have you ever seem Thomas the Tank Engine?  I saw that Ringo Starr, George Carlin, and Alec Baldwin have all narrated it for at least 52 episodes each
128836	agent_2:Same! Soccer is definitely interesting though, it actually makes more money than all the other major sports combined. agent_1:ya that is crazy, I want to see a soccer game with 3 teams, that sounds crazy and it actually exists! agent_2:Wow, how does that even work? Soccer is fascinating. Jon Stewart was actually once good enough of a player to represent the U.S!	agent_1:that is crazy, ya I think he played for the USA back in 1983, I bet he was really good!
11255	agent_2:I wonder where those are?  I hope not to see those!  The fear of snakes certainly is hard-wired into not only monkey brains but my brain too! agent_1:I never really knew monkeys were afraid of snakes, but I guess it makes sense.  I wonder if they are also afraid of the legless lizards that aren't snakes.  Sounds similar to me. agent_2:Could be! Did you know that crocodiles are more closely related to birds than snakes and lizards?  I'm not sure how when they look so much like a lizard.	agent_1:Agreed, but I remember actually reading that somewhere before.  What I didn't realize though was that their organs were lined up one in front of the other instead of side by side.
49474	agent_2:It's like the Oscars, there are so many times when you look back on the winners and think there were better, more entertaining movies out there.   agent_1:Yes, it's very political. Anyway, I enjoyed chatting with you! agent_2:The same here.  Try to make today your perfect day, however that is.	agent_1:Thanks! Great advice!
3143	agent_1:Hello there, did you see the Black Panther film that was recently in theaters? agent_2:Yea, I think Chawick Boseman did a great job as T'Challa agent_1:I have yet to see the movie but I heard that he did a really good job as well. 	agent_2:Ryan Coogler did an awesome job directing Black Panther and Michael B Jordan was good too
46488	agent_2:Ever watch 3rd Rock from teh Sun?  It won a Golden globe for Best Comedy in 1997, beating all sorts of other series for it. agent_1:i think that the fix was in on that one. how did they beat Seinfeld? agent_2:You know, I watched a few eps of that and never really got the appeal of that show.  Or Friends for that matter... maybe I just wasn't in the right demographic, I don't know.  	agent_1:I guess there are many types of humor and we each have our own. Anyway, great chat!
105589	agent_1:I find it boring as well and also a waste of water lol, a golf course consumes 321,000 gallons of water per day, seems really excesive to me agent_2:Seems excessive to me too. What about the golf course that's in Dubai though? That one uses four million gallons of water a day, that's insane! agent_1:Wow 4 million gallons that is insane I agree, too much water, must cost a fortune to keep it running	agent_2:I agree with you. And I think water is going to continue to get more expensive. Did you ever know that Babe Ruth actually played golf? And he was famous for it? I only heard about him playing baseball
74071	agent_1:i never realized how good dogs were at knowing what pointing is. but if you point, a dog will follow your finger. its great agent_2:Dogs are pretty smart at least some of them.  agent_1:haha yea there are certainly some doofy ones out there	agent_2:Did you know that google actually prefers dogs.
2117	agent_2:If you had to bucket list, what will be number on your bucket list? agent_1:travel the world and explore as many countries as possible . and you? agent_2:About the same travel the world, visit places that I have never visit before, no matter how far.	agent_1:yeah that would be incredible. d o you like dogs?
12811	agent_1:I'm surprised that someone who runs so much died at 73. I would have thought he would have lived longer from being healthy agent_2:I dont think they every released an official cause of death, but yes, somone who could run 3 marathons a day for 10 days straight certainly must have been in tip top shape. agent_1:Maybe all the running was hard on his heart. He's from Scotland and never ran a race in his kilt. I'm not sure if those are very aerodynamic	agent_2:They do seem like theyd be very heavy, especially to keep up that 7 minute per mile pace - even when he was running 100 miles.  I cant even do that for one mile.
102914	agent_1:hahaha never heard that theory before!  Could be,  I think its really strange.  agent_2:Very strange. Do you like learning about the moon at all? agent_1:Absolutely!  I hear that Mars' moon,  phobos,  is 1/3 hollow weird huh	agent_2:that is so weird to think. The moon moves far away at the rate our fingernails grow, that is interesting.
113304	agent_1:Wow I want that job. They still spend 20 times more on postage than bandwidth though agent_2:Yes. Blockbuster laughed when netflix told them to focus more on online services agent_1:WHo is laughing now though. DO you like comedy?	agent_2:I love it. Did you know Chapman from Monty Python used to be a doctor?
116256	agent_1:Disney has a history of that, I'm surprised they are still doing it. Have you seen the Bartless Simpsons episode? agent_2:No, I am a huge fan of the Simpsons though, but only the first 10-12 seasons, I don't think I have seen that one.  How about you, are you a fan? agent_1:I am, but I have missed that one as well. Who is your favorite Thomas the Train narrator?	agent_2:I think I read that Ringo Starr and others have done the voices if I'm correct.  Ringo is certainly cool, but who are the other two?
49300	agent_1:That's awesome.  agent_2:Do you play those console games like Nintendo?  My son loves his Xbox, that's about his only source of entertainment. agent_1:I used to love playing Nintendo. I saw it can only be displayed in 54 colors.	agent_2:I guess Nintendo is a bit dated now.  I remember the days when Space Invaders was the height of video gaming.  I don't think it even had ten colors.
154066	agent_2:Did you know that wikileaks published the government's plan to destroy wikileaks? agent_1:That's a little strange!  Did you hear that 86% of the land in Nevada is owned by the us government agent_2:No I didn't know that, wow that is a lot.  I guess a man impersonated a government official and sold the eiffel tower, twice. 	agent_1:That is really odd.  According to Canada's laws all radios have to play at least 40% Canadian music
74439	agent_1:do you like dance? agent_2:I like watching it sometimes, especially Michael Jackson doing his moves! agent_1:Nice. DId you know that Bruce Lee was a cha cha dancer?	agent_2:I didn't know that! I also didn't know that Tupac danced ballet in high school. Hard to imagine.
34524	agent_2:I didn't hear about that.  That could be kind of creepy to hear them! agent_1:It would be! They can make the sounds of car alarms and chainsaws LOL I would be so scared agent_2:I agree.  Switching topics..are you a fashion fan of clothing?  Apple once had a clothing line in 1986.  I never knew that.	agent_1:I never knew that either! I am a fan of clothes though I'm wearing some right now LOL. I would want to see what these Apple clothes look like though
126168	agent_2:That's amazing! They tried to sell to Blockbuster a few times.  agent_1:Blockbuster made a terrible business decision by not buying them.  agent_2:Definitely! They could have bought for $50 million! 	agent_1:Oh wow! They really missed out. Did you know that Netflix still spends more money on postage than bandwidth? 20 times more actually.
151232	agent_2:True. Did you hear of the Saints cheerleaders rule? agent_1:Yes they are not allowed to eat in the same place as the players agent_2:Yes and they also have to leave mid meal if they walk in	agent_1:Yes it is so sexist and it really needs to go now
59930	agent_1:I kind of want a stationary bicycle with a laptop desk attached. Have you see those? I think that would be cool and good for health and focus. agent_2:I haven't but that is something that I would be interested in.  I'm going to have to look that up.  President Andrew Johnson never attended school in his life.   His wife helped him to learn math and how to read.  That's amazing.   agent_1:Quite interesting! And the on the other hand, we have speed readers who can read at 4700 words per minute. I wonder how they verify that.	agent_2:I don't know but I would be able to read a lot of books if I could read that fast!
115531	agent_1:That seems impossible but I guess every country has their own beliefs. I wonder if you could domesticate it, maybe it would develop a white patch like other animals that become pets agent_2:I have not developed a white patch, so I guess I'm not a pet. Well, I enjoyed chatting! agent_1:Haha let's hope it stays that way. Nice talking to you too!	agent_2:Ta!
12046	agent_2:Haha well that is one benefit of the electric-car then! On a different note though, what do you think about Fox News? Apparently they broadcasting over 86 countries around the world agent_1:About the only one I watch these days! I didn't know Richard Nixon was one of the creators!  agent_2:Yeah I didn't know that either! I also didn't know that they were going to sue The Simpsons because they kept parodying them, I thought that fox owns The Simpsons?	agent_1:I did too! Didn't know they were going to create a cable channel  just for The Simpsons! Do you watch that show?
9684	agent_2:I had heard that, but I guess i just remember the white and black from all the history books, or rather the illustrations and descriptions.   agent_1:They always depicted it that way but they only wore black for special occasions.  agent_2:I wonder why they always were depicted like that, I mean color is so much more fun.	agent_1:That's a very good question. There is a store in Alabama that only sells clothing and items found in unclaimed baggage.
135738	agent_1:Well that sure is one place I would like 3G, especially if I am stranded or need help agent_2:They could use radio, it think it is more for the  convenience to contact sponsors or loved ones on top than safety.  agent_1:Is it? I didn't know that. They probably have that there too. I guess the internet would then be to search things up or entertainment.	agent_2:Internet is also you for videocalls and sending photos. The things that you would send to others when your are on top of a mountain. Do you use videocalls ?
151145	agent_1:Yes he is very intelligent. He was working on his Master's already when he was drafted! agent_2:That is amazing. You know what else I find amazing? Kellan Moore is actually the only left handed QB in the league. That's very hard for me to believe but it's true! agent_1:I did not know that. You would think there would be more. I wonder if that's an advantage or a disadvantage?	agent_2:I would probably guess an advantage since players aren't accustomed to a left handed QB. Imagine being in a huddle knowing your QB is left handed. Speaking of huddles, did you know the circular huddles was created by a deaf QB to prevent opposing teams from reading his hand signals?
33014	agent_2:I like him too. Did you know he wanted to be a comic book artist?	agent_1:Yeah , I am glad he became a rapper though because despite him liking spiderman much I like him as a rapper
48725	agent_1:I do like it, one of my favorite shows is House, have you watch that one? agent_2:I havent,  is it good? agent_1:I think its good, Hugh Laurie the main actor of the show is the highest paid drama actor.	agent_2:I hear he makes like 700,000 per episode.
130724	agent_2:How is that possible lol, the congress is a circus at times agent_1:Yep. I didn't know the Rep's and Dem's played a baseball game every year since 1909.   agent_2:So they also have a rivalry in sports, do you know which side is currently the winner?	agent_1:The GOP is ahead 3 games. I can't believe Norway donated $1B to save the Amazon rainforest.  Good for them!
127066	agent_1:And apparently as good as he was, his sister was always better than him agent_2:That must have really sucked, big time. agent_1:Or maybe is was a push for him to keep trying to get better. Do you know ALlen Iverson?	agent_2:Well, that's true too.  Yes, I know Allen Iverson, he was a good player.
164793	agent_1:I wonder if it works though? I would play a lot better if I were put in a pink locker room LOL, what about you? agent_2:I would find it hilarious. I'm sure it was supposed to be some sort of play on pink being a girls color. Who knows with it being Iowa though.  agent_1:Yeah that's true. have you gone bowling recently? Apparently bowling in the 60s, the top players made more than top football players, that's completely the opposite of now btw	agent_2:It probably has a lot to do with the longevity of the career of a bowler vs a football player. It seems like football players have such a short career due to all the injuries.
155681	agent_1:Thats funny and also makes a lot of sense, the Pats have dominated the league for a while now.  agent_2:Did you see the end of the super bowl 46? agent_1:Not sure, could  be what happened towards the end of it? did the Patriots play?	agent_2:The patriots let the giants score a touchdown.
280	agent_1:ya I don't like that that makes me mad, do you have any pets? I guess In Japan there are more pets than there are kids under the age of fifteen agent_2:They really love their pets huh? No, I don't have any pets. Do you? agent_1:no we used to have a dog but we were only watching her for a bit and the owner took her away, we had lots of pets as kids though like iguanas and rabbits and such	agent_2:In Boulder, Colorado you cannot own a pet. You can be their guardian though.
150524	agent_1:Whats more interesting about Tupac was he lived in a rich area of the bay area marin!  agent_2:Yeah, thats cool. I love watching movies about dance and that is how I learned that Tupac was in ballet in high school. He was in the Nutcracker.  agent_1:Its so hard to imagine him in the nutcracker. We crack fiend momny and different daddies. 	agent_2:Yep, dance can really bring people together. Professional dancers can go through at least 4 pairs of pointe shoes per week. They train very intensely.
61325	agent_2:for sure, that is where they get you. I may look at the terms if i ever go to mt everest, they can get interent on the peak! agent_1:Woah theres signal there? that is amazing. Can you imagine life without the internet? there would be chaos in the street,  agent_2:It is 3g! I couldn't imagine life without the internet, sometimes I wish we could go back to simpler times before kids changed forever	agent_1:Those were good times, maybe less internet would be a good thing, Im just glad there a copy stored of the whole thing
7759	agent_1:Yeah he does have some pretty decent songs,Ive heard the Uptown Funk video has over 30 million views, thats crazy. agent_2:I didnt realize that.  I didnt realize that he started out as an elvis impersonator either!  agent_1:I saw that on Facebook, did you know that Myspace turned down an offer to buy facebook for 75 million.	agent_2:no i didnt, haha I bet they are kicking them selves, because facebook basically made them irrelevent.
83685	agent_2:How does that work?  Can I make one too?  Smoking near an Apple computer voids the warranty. agent_1:Huh... Sure, it would be a great invention in Water World. Kevin Costner would be so happy! agent_2:Was that a good movie?  Someone built a 16 bit computer just using basic minecraft building blocks.  Wonder how that works?	agent_1:It was passable...Transhumanists want to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks
156112	agent_1:Plus a lot fewer concussions. Engineering is the way to go for career longevity.  agent_2:Though, only 11 minutes of live gameplay for 16 games in a season isn't too bad of a deal. agent_1:If you can keep your health, sure. I think that no matter how good the helmet is, the brain is going to get banged around a lot. 	agent_2:I wonder if it helps now that they keep chips in the shoulder pads and footballs. Or if that just helps more with the stats than anything else
64668	agent_1:Yes, I know Bellamy made it into the Guinness Book of world records 2010. He currently holds the world record for the most guitars smashed on a tour 140 guitars. agent_2:Thats a lot of guitars to smash. Lol. The queens guitarist actually has a phd in astrophysics.  agent_1:Brian Harold May, CBE is a enlgish musician, singer, songwriter and astrophysicist. He is the best known as the lead guitarist of the rock bank queen. He used a hame-built electric guitar called the Red Special.	agent_2:Yeah, did you know he uses coins as guitar picks. He ususally uses the english sixpence.
120255	agent_2:Is that right?  Why do you say that? agent_1:Because of all the Trumpsim and then the lack of support, then they supported him again and I guess there are many reasons agent_2:I don't understand.  The Trumpisms, you mean his divisive nature?  I wasn't aware that they have wavered on their support of him.  I'm not a very political person.	agent_1:Yeah thats what I meant, I think people dont know how to vote, do you like Trump as president?
42828	agent_2:Actually he did. One of his students was Ellie Kemper from The Office. What are the odds?! agent_1:Crazy. I loved that show. The crew really dressed them in appropriate costumes. agent_2:I also loved that show. They certainly did look like convincing typical office workers. 	agent_1:Have you watched Firefly? One of the best shows that only got one season, they used costumes left over from Starship Troopers, another of my favorite guilty pleasures.
28603	"agent_2:In the old days with manually prepared animation frames, I could see why - that's a really time consuming process.  But the modern stuff seems more unique.  Computer animation has really sped up the process.  But sometimes, it still take a long time for an idea to form.  Did you know that ""Wreck-It-Ralph"" started development in the late 1980s and when on for three decades and though 4 working titles? agent_1:No way. I should really watch that movie because I haven't seen it yet! I love visiting Disneyland which is right near the Disney Studios in Burbank California.  agent_2:I have visited Epcot in FL, but that is the extent of my exposure to Disney theme parks and resorts.  Its such a behemoth that its considered one of Hollywood's Big 6 film studios!  "	agent_1:Yeah I totally see that being that case! Epcot is cool though! Well it was nice talking with you have a great day!
59290	agent_2:Some people have principals and can't be bought for any price.  I guess when they were done, they were done and no price would make them change their minds.  That's ok, I'm the same way. On a different note, do you like piano music? agent_1:I do, it's such a beautiful instrument. The hospital I work at has a piano in the lobby and people will come in and play it from time to time and I love just standing there listening to them play.  agent_2:That's awesome, I love it too.  Did you know Richard Nixon wrote a piano concerto and performed it live on the Tonight Show?	"agent_1:I didn't know that. That's pretty amazing. Did you know that Freddie Mercury used the same piano to record ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" as Paul McCartney used to record ""Hey Jude?"""
33963	agent_1:I hope I'm not just part of some hologram!  I think scientists can theorize about many things with the universe, and never be able to prove them.   agent_2:Yeah, I feel like sometimes they just throw out the most craziest idea they can think of and see if anybody jumps on and agrees with them.  There's another theory I heard that there is only 1 electron in the whole universe. agent_1:I theorize that we are all part of one great comic book, beholden to the whims of the great comic book writer.  Prove me wrong.	agent_2:Stan Lee would be proud of you!  Excelsior!
65675	agent_2:laugh.  These days there are apps on your cell phones which can fake a call and let you escape - after all an iphone now has more computing power than the entire us nuclear arsenal agent_1:Yeah. I just don't think I would survive in today's dating world. I would just want to sit at a bar and watch some ball games with a few beers.  agent_2:Well you might could go out to a comedy film with your date - bromantic comedies like Harold and Kumar could be good for date night	agent_1:I could date them but I don't smoke weed. I do love comedies. Do you?
160996	agent_2:I feel like of all the fruits, banana is the most disrespectful. agent_1:Why is that?  I'm curious to know. agent_2:President Apple sounds acceptable. President Banana seems like they are making fun of him. President Starfruit is ok, just no banana.	agent_1:Oh, okay.  You are funny.  One more fact before I said goodbye:  Teddy Roosevelt banned Christmas trees at the white house.  Nice talking to you.  Have a nice evening.
148150	agent_2:True.  That's a weird rule where the Saints won't let the cheerleaders eat at the same restaurant as an NFL player. agent_1:Yeah, especially that they have to leave if one enters. agent_2:Crazy.  	agent_1:One thing i am not a fan of with the game is the fact there is only 11 minutes of live game play.
133076	"agent_2:I did hear about that! Municipal staffers in Philly were actually calling themselves the ""Crisco Cops"" because they were out greasing the  light poles so that fans wouldn't try climbing up them. Are you a fan of the Eagles? agent_1:I am not but I am a fan of funny and that's funny. Cops know their fans are so ridiculous that they pregrease poles... agent_2:I can't believe how crazy their fans are! In 1998 there 60 fistfights in one Monday Night Football game against the 49ers."	agent_1:Yeah, they are the only professional team with a jail in their stadium. Well, their old stadium...
56811	agent_1:That is very true. Yes I read quite a bit actually. Heard that there are more libraries than McDonald's in the US. I love that fact agent_2:Yeah that is awesome to know, you'd think it be the other way around but i guess with all the schools and universities beside the public ones it makes since.  agent_1:I guess so. In Sacramento the public library now offers other things besides books like sewing machines and such	agent_2:Sounds like a neat concept. Apparently there was a comedian that was Knighted.
114632	agent_2:Yeah, I watched all the seasons. I might have missed some episodes here and there. It was so good they tried to remake it in UK verbatim. It wasn't the same, I guess, because it failed terribly agent_1:Yeah I wonder how bad it sounded that way.  Did you ever watch South Park? agent_2:I never really could get into it. It was quite violent and crass. Speaking of violence, did you hear about the people who lived through the Las Vegas shooting and the California massacre? How scary!	agent_1:Yeah that was so sad and yeah that would be so scary.  The ones who did survive could have nightmares for life.
109760	agent_1:In in that minute we have altered earth in a devastable and destructive way,  agent_2:I agree with you.  So sad.I just heard today that the Earth will be almost free of Helium by the end of the 21st century.  I guess no more balloons for future generations! agent_1:That will be a sad day, I agree, so do you like to travel?	agent_2:Yes, I love to travel.  How about you?
67460	agent_1:Same, I do not have cable either. I also watch a lot of youtube. Youtube is the second largest search engine on the net!  agent_2:That is impressive, I want to watch the first YouTube video, it was apparently a guy talking to an elephant LOL agent_1:That sounds pretty lame. I wonder how many views that video got.	agent_2:That's a good question, especially since the first video but very boring LOL. Did you know that Google created a network to watch YouTube clips and it learned to recognize cats haha
52612	"agent_1:Speaking of CA governors, the beatles song ""come together"" was written for timothy leary's 1969 california governor campaign. I wonder if it helped him at the polls agent_2:Well, I remember the song, but not the Governor, lol. I bet the Beatles got a lot of play time on the radio.  agent_1:Yea, I really like to make a foxhole radio using a razorblade and pencil as a diode to see if I can listen to them"	agent_2:Nowadays you can just go online and find radio stations to listen to. There's even a website that has thousands of classical radio dramas for free
135693	agent_2:I did watch it, it was one of my favorite shows agent_1:ya it was pretty cool, I can't believe they let George Carlin do some narration on there, like he is definitely known for a filthy mouth haha agent_2:I liked the voice of Alec Baldwin I think he is a great narrator, also Ringo Stark  both are pretty decent.	agent_1:ya George Carlins voice is too iconic for me I think that wouldn't work as well, did you ever watch the simpsons?
128958	agent_1:For sure, as a kid I thought it was real lol and thought they had a big laser beam they moved all the time agent_2:Haha,  when did you realize it wasnt?  I love all the digital stuff they can show on the tv now,  makes understanding what is going on easier.  lol  agent_1:Maybe a few years ago lol. Kidding when i was like 12	agent_2:Haha.  Its a good invention.
716	agent_1:Yeah I heard he hated fan fiction, he doesnt care about it at all so changing the subject a bit do you use computers a lot? agent_2:It seems like that is what I do the vast majority of my day.  I'm not ready to upload my mind to a computer or memory stick like transhumanists, but it is like an extension of me some days. agent_1:I agree theres so much we dont understand about the human mind, Transhumanist must be missing key elements of the human essence.	agent_2:Are you a PC or a Mac?  Be warned that being a smoker an an apple computer user could actually void the warranty as they see it as a biohazard if someone smokes by it.  I am neither, but that's beside the point.
111960	agent_1:I hope they hit the beat because baby smiles are the best! agent_2:they are! I need to test this theory with my friends newborn! do you know how drivethroughs were invented? agent_1:I doo not know why but I think McDonalds did it.	agent_2:yeah they did, back in 1975, they did it because soldiers couldn't get out of their cars while wearing their uniforms
143479	agent_2:Really? How many countries have you visited? I've been in about 43 countries. agent_1:I've been to about 25 so you beat me there. agent_2:It's cool. 25 is a lot. In fact, it's much more comfortable to travel now. In 1960s air travel was up to 10% slower in order to save fuel costs.	agent_1:It was great chatting.
112241	agent_1:I'm not sure but I know that is valued in the multiple billions of dollars, so definitely too rich for my blood LOL what do you think about other Disney movies by the way agent_2:They produced many - which ones are you talking about? agent_1:Well which ones are your favorites? I know that I really like the Lion King and that movie was actually dub into Zulu when it was released	agent_2:I like Lion King. I'm not very familiar with many of them though.  By the way, does Disney own Pixar?
47486	"agent_1:When I played soccer with my friends as a kid, I felt that it was pretty easy. I know sometimes it can get hard what with all of the ball stealing and having to get past a goalie, but it was easy enough for me to enjoy. My friends were so good though! Doing all of that fancy footwork. It was a fun experience! I can see why Jon Stewart played soccer. But I had no idea that he did! agent_2:Right, it feels like in the US that more people play soccer as kids than watch the professional sport.  agent_1:Yeah that's too bad!  thought my friends were so good, it would be neat if they could have gone ""pro"". But it seems like it isn't as easy in the U.S. And also I've never really seen a game of female soccer on TV before, ever, that I can recall. Hm..."	agent_2:Yeah and the women's team has never placed under third place in the World Cup since 1991. More people really should watch it
137751	agent_1:It must if they keep doing it haha. I wonder if Georgie Tech did that in 1916 because they beat a team 222-0. agent_2:georgia tech did it first and it worked. after that it never worked again. poor cumberland. they got pinked to deaeth. agent_1:I bet they cancelled all games forever after that lol. Did you know in the 1960s, bowlers made more than football players?	agent_2:i wonder how much them bowlers actually made then. twice a little amount is really not that much though. still, i missed my era. i was born late.
79100	agent_2:Sure, I don't have one at the moment, but they are quite useful. I'm surprised by the history of the drive thru. agent_1:You don't have a car? I too was surprised about the drive thru. McDonalds and I thought they were older than that. agent_2:Yes, right now, I am borrowing a friend's car, so technically not mine. I figured with the US car culture drive thrus would have been around before. 	agent_1:The trunk is called that because they actually had a trunk on the back of cars.
138445	agent_1:No sorry I don't.  But I think the painting of the locker room is more of a tactic for them.  agent_2:It seems like an insult to me implying pink is a weak color.  On another note, did you know babies automatically dance when they hear music? agent_1:Maybe you should send an email to them if you feel personally offended by their actions!  Nothing with change if you don;t speak up.  I did know that,  thats cute.  I did not realize bruce lee was a great dancer!	agent_2:Michael Jackson has a patent on a device that helped him lean during his dance moves.  Who would have known it wasn't him leaning?  Sounds like the trick Michael Carbanaro did on his show.
62614	agent_1:That's brilliant! I do not underestimate those type of minds. I am always jealous of that forethought. agent_2:He knew that he was creative. he had successful films before Star Wars.  agent_1:James earl jones only spent 2.5 hours recording his part in star wars?	agent_2:Just a few lines. I don't think his character was on screen much. I wonder if he got residuals for that role.
77454	agent_1:I know I have been trying to get one installed on my car but I don't know where to buy one or who I can get to install it. agent_2:Haha. Old cars used to have wooden trunks on the back. agent_1:So glad they got rid of those. They were ugly. I do like a big trunk in my car now though. Its essential	agent_2:Cars are expensive not only to individuals, but to society. The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, public health, health care, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life.
81927	agent_1:I see agent_2:Did you play NES? Or SNES? Or genesis? agent_1:SNES mainly. Man, I remember those nights of playing all night	agent_2:I played SNES and Genesis. Madden football. lots of fun.
47186	"agent_1:Fish can be useful for research, the illnesses that can affect the zebrafish also affect humans.  agent_2:Interesting!  There is a species of fish that lives on land all its adult life.  Have no idea what it's called though.  lol agent_1:I think it is a mudskipper, I don't know it they live on land, but they can ""walk"". "	agent_2:That might be it.  There is a fish called the barreleye fish that has a transparent head.  Do you like dogs?
4700	agent_2:Yeah, they have had pitchers with 4,5, and 6 fingers on their pitching hand. Uncommon, but totally true! agent_1:Another weird thing about the cubs is the last time they won the ottoman empire was still going. Do you really think they were cursed? agent_2:I don't know about cursed, probably just bad luck on their part.  	agent_1:They started out so good, they were the first team to win back to back. seems kinda weird maybe baseball is fixed.
136940	agent_1:Yeah I mean if the  guy  was a caucasian male then the officer would have helped him out, given him out a badge for good citizen, it's just terrible we still face these racial dilemmas agent_2:I agree and I liked that DL Hughley called them out on it. There needs to be awareness. agent_1:Yeah, I think that Hughley did a good thing by calling it out, after all he has thousands of users and that will get the message heard.	agent_2:And it sucks that he was just trying to do a good thing by helping a drunk guy home. He didn't even commit a crime.
43635	agent_1:what do You mean ;) does that mean You have no Facebook account ? agent_2:no, I just used facebook to play games.  I can talk to my friends in person or other ways.  They used to do that in the olden days. lol agent_1:Yeah, my parents told me all about that  :) crazy ;)  all the bacteria flying around people talking in real life ! ;) lol	agent_2:I'm not sure what that means?  Did you know that domesticated animals have white patches on their foreheads?
123922	agent_2:Thanks. I'm just looking for the cheapest way to get access to most movies and TV shows. I'll have to do more research. agent_1:Just think, Netflix started because of a late fee lol. agent_2:Some of the best things were started out of spite. They'd better learn from their own example, because people could very easily go to pirating stuff if they become too expensive or complicated to use.	agent_1:I agree with you on that one. I know they made people mad raising their prices up just a buck or two!
152312	agent_2:Yes, I do too. I mean Tom Brady is the total package He is strong, handsome, smart, at the top of his prime and he has a super hot wife! Gisele Bundchen the victoria secret super model! who by the way makes twice as much as her hubby Tom Brady! wowzer talk about a beautiful successful family. Almost wish i could be a fly on their wall.. 2 perfect and beautiful human beings what are their flaws? but it's not all about the material or physical. agent_1:I wonder what will happen when he retires? I wonder if the Patriots have someone waiting in the wings to replace him? He came on when Drew Bledsoe got hurt - I hope they have a backup plan. agent_2:They are screwed if they don't. Whoever will replace him will have a huge spot to fill being that Brady has been known to be the best in his time. Fun fact about Brady... Did you know that prior to 2007 he had never thrown 30 touchdown passes in a season? he threw a 50 record that year, I wonder what inspired him or if his hard work finally paid off... I want what hes taking! also, I learned he has never eaten a STRAWBERRY in his life, WHAT?? who does that, I don't think he is from this world. 	agent_1:He's definitely otherworldly. How can you avoid strawberries? They're delicious! It's good that he came into his own. His high school JV team was awful, apparently. He was the backup qb, but didn't get to play. I wonder how it would have worked out for them if he had?
79014	"agent_1:Reggie Miller went on to be come a NBA hall of famer.  Did his sister get into the NBA hall of fame as well? agent_2:No, women can't be in the NBA. Although his sister upstaged him back in 1982 when they were in high school by scoring 105 in her game to his 40 from his game. agent_1:I see, so as a high schooler, she beat him roundly.  As an adult female she has no stage to earn millions putting a ball in a hole.  I always shoot my free throws ""granny style""  I like the way it feels."	agent_2:Ha me too! The NBA players won't use it because it looks foolish, but it's supposed to be the best.
89842	agent_2:He will probably vacation the rest of his life,  as long as he doesnt blow all his money lol agent_1:Yeah, he could kick back. or he could buy part of a sports franchise. agent_2:Thats true,  make some money,  invest. 	agent_1:Yeah, he can set up his family for life. i know that he has donated money to many kids to go to college.
72416	agent_1:The loch ness monster is a protected species! agent_2:Yes I read that, it has been for a long time. 1900 something I believe is when they protected them. I guess that's the reason I never pursued zoology. While it's interesting it's just so much reading.  agent_1:You would like Germany then. They are the first country in the world to universally give animals guaranteed rights!	agent_2:I've been there before. It's very nice. Lots of great ways to travel across the country trains, boats, planes it's also very bike friendly which is a good way to explore.
114027	agent_1:I agree. They have determined that granny style is the most effective way to score points on the line. That's so surprising.  agent_2:In 2002 Miller single handedly eliminated New jersy nuts in fifty and final game of the first round of the play. agent_1:Wow. I did not know that. Were you aware that Air Jordan's were banned from the NBA when released?	agent_2:It's very shocking news.
143749	agent_1:awesome,  do you have any dogs?  Yeah thats really interesting! agent_2:I have one and t is actually true that dogs understand pointing, such smart creatures agent_1:awesome,  what kind of dog do you have.  Yeah I did read that too and elephants!	agent_2:Yeah elephants. I have a cocker spaniel. Did you hear about that project in Turkey to help the dogs?
127111	agent_2:Wow, I didn't know it was actually illegal anywhere. Wonder what the reasoning is? agent_1:I'm not sure, but it is illegal in the German State of Schleswig-Holstein.  agent_2:Did you know that Mark Zuckerburg is color blind? Hence the blue coloring on Facebook.	agent_1:No, I didn't. That is crazy. Is it just for certain colors?
11366	agent_1:Me too! What would be the three meals you would have? agent_2:I did order a bagel, meal balls and I love cheesecake, what about you? agent_1:Probably some protein like steak and a bunch of carbs. The egg and bacon bagel sounds really good though...	agent_2:I guess Aspen and Denver Colorado are a lot the same, both places have lots of mountains great for skiing.
143773	agent_2:I didn't know that.  I'm not sure dogs deserve that.  Switching topic a bit but do you like the Simpsons?  There is only one out of many, many episodes that Bart doesn't appear or is mentioned.   agent_1:I've watched a few episodes. It surprises me that there is even one. I thought he was the big star of the show. agent_2:I guess but to me Homer is the funniest character.  I think it's funny they did a version of the 70's show in the UK.  I guess it bombed. 	agent_1:Maybe their life in the 70s was different than in the states.  Personally, I think it's interesting that there are so many episodes of Pokemon out there.  There are over 750!
71923	agent_1:That they do.  Did you know that nearly 35 percent of the Black males in Alabama cannot vote?  It's appalling.   agent_2:Astronauts vote from space. Do you know ? agent_1:I did know that.  It's so weird but I guess it makes sense.  Every vote is important!  That's why it's so strange that it took til almost 1920 for all men in the UK to get the vote.	agent_2:The biggest misunderstanding about canvassing is that it's about changing people's minds. It's about expressing the policy of the political party.
50113	agent_2:It is good. It's got some new characters and cast but the originals all reprise their roles. agent_1:I heard that Huckleberry Milner and Bob Odenkirk are among the new members of the movie agent_2:They are along with Jonathan Banks.  The movie is set in the 1960s by the way.	agent_1:In the 60s really? so it happened before the firs movie?is it also based in the present time?
151261	agent_2:Maybe that's why I didn't link him with the Patriots.  Did you know that quarterback Baker Mayfield thought about becoming a competitive gamer?   agent_1:I can believe it, getting to the NFL is a giant gamble with injury and lack of confidence and all. agent_2:They definitely have a short-term lifespan. Despite the enormous salaries some have, on average an engineer makes more in a lifetime than most star athletes do.	agent_1:They do and some live the rest of their lives with broken bodies and minds, definitely a gamble.
154988	agent_2:I know right, like 100 is enough lets just call the game, did you hear about ESPN and the Emmy the network won? agent_1:I did not know that, from what? agent_2:Because of the creation of the yellow firt down line	agent_1:wow, that is amazing! i love that line, it makes it so easy to see how far they have to go. I used to think it was real as a kid lol
142201	agent_1:Ah. agent_2:So on a different note, do you like cars? agent_1:I do. Did you know that the 1908 Ford Model T was the first car accessible to the masses?	agent_2:Really? Was that the car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company?
12393	agent_2:I do even though I prefer football.  Why did you ask? agent_1:I was wondering if it interest you,  I learned some fun facts recently. Baseball managers can technically play if needed.  agent_2:In order for managers to play, they need to know how to play baseball though.  	agent_1:I am pretty sure they know how to play baseball considering they are baseball managers...........
35623	agent_1:Yes, that's probably true.  Michael Caine is into drama and acting because he was following pretty girls in his high school drama class. agent_2:Guess it paid off lol, he is now a great actor I bet he didnt have that in mind. Do you like Shakepeare works? I think he is a great poat and writter. agent_1:He was a good poet, but I'm not into poetry really. He was called England's national poet.  I wonder if we have one of those today?	agent_2:I think talet like that comes only once in a life time. To write 39 plays, 154 sonets, pure talent.
81457	agent_2:ya the technology is very impressive, also crazy is the cable that runs across the atlantic ocean with phone and internet service is only about 3 inches in diamter, you'd think they'd use satalleties for that these days agent_1:I agree, that cable must be crazy strong though, imagine resisting all that pressure, its a really important cable and 2.7 is a really thin diameter. agent_2:Ya I agree, like what if a boat crashes into it or something? It seems so precarious, did you hear about the trick with a phone book?	agent_1:No, can you tell me about that trick please!
88669	agent_1:Hey how is it going? Are you a big fan of LeBron James? agent_2:I am, LeBron is the best, what about you? do you like him as a player? agent_1:He is so good, I think he is the best player of all time. I could see why he regrets giving his oldest son the same name, too much to live up to.	agent_2:I agree with you maybe with Michael Jordan but I do think LeBron is better, do you think he will be around untill his oldest son is able to play in the NBA?
164409	agent_1:I recently read that they are the only community owned major franchise in american professional sports, having a sold out game since 1960 and involving the community as a whole. agent_2:Thats awesome! The green bay packers are named after the indian packing company, who paid for their first uniforms on the condition the team be named after them. agent_1:Wow how long a way they have come from barely having their uniforms to being a nationally recognized football team.	agent_2:The green bay packers have sold out every game since 1960 too!
103132	agent_2:I think people are living farther from their families than they used to, on average, and traveling more. Did you know that you're not allowed to take cranberry sauce on a plane? agent_1:I did not know that.  What is the reason? agent_2:I'm not sure, but the TSA has a service called AskTSA where you can find the answer to questions like that.	agent_1:Oh okay.  I think it is good to call the number if you are not sure.
1672	agent_1:Yes, hmmm seems like MJ's songs can cause fires! lol I think it would be pretty interesting to be on Pink Floyd's houseboat called Astroria!  It's a recording studio. agent_2:It's funny the sound that using coins as guitar picks lends to a song. Queens' guitarist does that. agent_1:Yes, he likes the English sixpence.  Did you know Queen's guitarist has a PHD in astrophysics! Talented and smart.	agent_2:I would love to have seen the piano made out of aluminum, it was on the Hindenburg.
92783	"agent_1:I don't know. I didn't see it, just heard about it.  Apparently, they also have a music competition show called ""The Four.""  I wonder how the talent is of that. agent_2:Oh I love watching music competitions especially the audition part in the beginning.   agent_1:They are fun to see people make their breaks."	agent_2:Yes,  or completely not have the talent expected lol been fun chatting.
135757	agent_2:good suggestion!  It was nice talking with you...off to read lol! agent_1:I wonder if people would still watch if they shot granny style? agent_2:Haha yea that seems like an odd way to shoot the ball, but hey, if it's the best technique! I'd watch if it meant the teams scored more.	agent_1:Yeah, I'd watch just to see them do the strange looking shots! I wonder why people aren't more into women's sports. Reggie Miller's sister constantly outperformed him when he was in high school
159206	agent_2:Thats one of the few reasons to keep normal tv. Animated cartoons are my thing agent_1:That is a good point.  Did you use to watch cartoons on Saturday mornings growing up? agent_2:I did! Pokemon was one of them. There are now over 750 episodes	agent_1:That is just crazy how many episodes of that show they have made, wow.
31676	agent_1:Pretty interesting.  Well, it's been fun chatting with you. agent_2:Yep! agent_1:Enjoy the rest of your weekend.  Off to watch some NFL.	agent_2:You too.
118633	agent_2:I didn't realize there was one. I guess I didn't think about it being the National Basketball Association. If it's northern Canada that's a lot of travel for games.  agent_1:That's true but if they have a demand for a team they should put a team up there somewhere, it's interesting that the NBA's located in New York-New York, I never knew that agent_2:I did not either. Are you familiar with Reggie Miller?	agent_1:Yes I've heard of them. Wasn't his younger sister really good at basketball too? She would constantly beat the record that he set
160037	agent_1:Yes, it is. The first President of Zimbabwe was called President Banana. agent_2:The president of Indonesia has released 3 pop album in his office, this shows he is very much interested in Music also. It is very great. agent_1:I agree it sounds fun. It was nice chatting with you.	agent_2:Thanks. Have a great day.
44604	agent_2:I'm not sure. They probably aren't but I haven't thought about it. What do you think? agent_1:Honestly, I also don't really understand the difference between the two.  agent_2:Me either though I associate hip hop more with dancing.	agent_1:By the way, do you enjoy other types of entertainment?
65065	agent_1:I used to like that show, The Office, the early seasons anyway.  My wife loved Mad Men, I think she just really liked Jon Hamm. agent_2:probably, if you like radio you can listen to thousands of classic radio dramas for free through a website agent_1:I listen to the radio a lot, especially when in the car.  The one fact that always boggles my mind is the ventriloquism used to be popular on the radio, I could do that.	agent_2:ha, entertainment before tv
113183	agent_1:Growing up, I lived 40 miles for a major city.  Then, we got over-the-air TV, when weather conditions were good.  Now I have COX cable.   agent_2:That is very interesting! Do you use Netflix as well?  agent_1:I use to, I use Amazon Prime.  Those subscriber fees (Netflix, Hulu,...) add up.  I did use Netflix DVD program until we were able to high-speed internet.	agent_2:I forgot about the Netflix DVD program. Did you know Netflix somehow spends 20x more on postage than bandwidth?
99240	agent_1:Agreed. Rap is basically a musical form of vocal delivery incorporating rhymes, street vernacular and rhythmic speech and Tupac was a master at it. agent_2:Yes he was. Did know know that McDonalds was paying rappers 5 dollars every time the referenced big macs. Wonder how much Tupac made off that deal. agent_1:Ha! Is that so? I didn't know that. I do know Eminem actually wanted to be a comic book artist growing up. Imagine how that would have turned out? I certainly can't!	agent_2:That would be some med up comic books huh.
13343	agent_1:They violated Facebook's rules. agent_2:Yes they did.  So I guess by violating both facebook and twitter rules that's why they worked together? agent_1:Yes, you are right.  Twitter will stop their access to certain site tools.	agent_2:That's good.  What that company was doing seems really wrong.  Getting private information and selling it?
32639	agent_1:Yet at the same time, a band got 20K from a silent album	agent_2:That is cool...I wonder who was listening, because musicians need to get 130,745 plays per day on spotify in order to get minimum wage. And by the way, what is a silent album?!
83212	agent_2:Yeah. Did you know women were not allowed to wear pants until 1993 there? agent_1:Yes and it was thanks to those two governors that protested by wearing them that they were allowed afterwards	agent_2:Yeah. Did you know Jordan's response when asked why he did not back up a fellow democrat?
116195	agent_1:I did not know that! I guess golf is more popular than what I thought. agent_2:I wonder if there are a lot of good players in the military?  agent_1:There must be, I wonder if they are allow to play in pro tournaments though, Babe Ruth was a famous golfer as well	agent_2:I've heard that, Babe Ruth was a great player at baseball.
83306	agent_2:yes it is! do you ever go to the library? agent_1:Yeah. I live in a community with only 400 people and it has a very limited selection, but sometimes I check out stuff and I go there when I need to print out something from the Internet. Do you? agent_2:ya I have gone before actually, and I guess libraries have started carrying video games? have you heard about this?	"agent_1:I know a lot of them do. I'm really interested in the ""library of things"" phenomenon. The library in the county seat here opened up a tool library, which is really neat. I like the idea of libraries as community hubs."
46936	agent_2:yeah, country music genre was the most listened to rush hour radio during the evening commute in 2009 agent_1:That's pretty crazy, I wonder if country is popular in South Africa, they could listen to it while driving their flame-thrower equipped cars agent_2:I'm not sure but that would be cool	agent_1:It's also pretty cool you can become a professional race car driver from playing Gran Turismo
151299	agent_1:Yes he does and it doesn't hurt to have Tom Brady. He may not always have the best stats but he shows up during the big games. agent_2:Well Brady is considered the greatest steal in nfl history and has many impressive accomplishments under his belt as a QB agent_1:I think he got himself in the perfect situation to sit behind Bledsoe and under Belicheck for a season before he took over.	agent_2:I kind of don't get why at the end of superbowl 46, the new england patriots were trying to let the NY giants score, while giants avoided scoring
142247	"agent_2:I have two small boys. Not familiar with any of the children's books. ""love"" seems like it might be cute though. agent_1:Yeah. I am a little interested in seeing it. I wonder if it is picture or drawings? My kids always love the pigeon books. agent_2:I haven't heard of the pigeon books, I'll have to check those out. Are you pumped for the superbowl? I always thought it was weird that three different sports with completely different rules are all called football."	agent_1:Yeah, I find the differences between college and the NFL weird. I look at NFL results and try to extrapolate those to college rules and get angry about the differences, relatively angry...
20147	agent_1:Yeah. Did you know the day had 55 hours when earth was formed agent_2:Yeah so short. Earth will be free of helium by the end of the century agent_1:yes no more fun balloons and funny voices I guess	agent_2:Yeah. It was nice chatting with you
42074	agent_2:He sacrificed money to stay in college four years and get a degree instead of going directly into the NBA. agent_1:If I remember right, I think he made a promise to his mother or grandmother that he would finish school before going to the NBA. agent_2:I think it was grandmother, that is such a nice gesture!	agent_1:I know!  He was a class act all the way around.  I was sad to see him retire.
66070	agent_2:That is quite a number! I cant even imagine that number. there are so few humans in comparison. agent_1:Yes so true. To put it into a different perspective, that is 7 million animal species. agent_2:and we are just one species. we need to recognize that we are part of a complex system, not above it.	agent_1:Amen to that! Well said partner. The study of animals is called zoology! Great talking with you on this fine morning!
32709	agent_2:they are worth 2 billion but 21.9 billion is their debt. I think they will erase that in the next 5 years. Did you hear how netflix started? agent_1:that is an insane amount of debt. i wonder what the interest payments are on that. they had better continue expanding. agent_2:I think that is why they are charging more. Netflix started because of the owner's 40 dollar late fee bill to Blockbuster lol	agent_1:yeah, they need more subscribers, here and around the world. 40 dollars sparked an empire. LOL Anyway great chat!
7899	agent_2:Really?  WOW!  Well, glad they went with a guy.  Although Ren is pretty bad ass! agent_1:Yeah I cant wait to finish up her story. They kept Vader and Luke's story a secret even from the cast. Giving out fake scrpits. I wonder if they have any of the same tricks up their sleeves agent_2:I think it's a great idea and really hope they do!	agent_1:There are also a lot of other comic stories I would love to see on the big screen. Hopefully one day. Have a great day!
18474	agent_2:It sure is. I know I liked batman, and both my sons like him. He is pretty popular. agent_1:It's interesting that he doesn't have any superpowers. agent_2:I know thats the best part. Anybody who wanted to could become batman. Just got to have the will power and drive to go through with it.	agent_1:Yeah, you're right. That's what makes the character so appealing. Have you heard of the Batman villain condiment king?
134006	agent_2:Haha interesting. I guess in France some people don't have much respect for the government as one person impersonated a government official and sold the eiffel tower twice. agent_1:That is very gutsy! I know that I couldn't do that. Do you know who the top three wealthiest US presidents were? agent_2:JFK, Washington and Jefferson. I guess that accounts for inflation.	agent_1:Yes it must. Did you hear about Wikileaks? Apparently the government wanted to shut them down and the plan to do so was leaked by them LOL
65442	agent_1:How do you spend $200M on that movie! agent_2:Steve Carrell?  lol  It's been 37 years since a comedy has won the academy award for best picture.  That's a long drought. agent_1:That is a long drought! I wonder why the academy does not appreciate the comedies?	agent_2:Not sure.  The early comedy cinema joke of slipping on a banana peel was a reference to slipping in horse manure.  lol
150978	agent_1:haha well I know that he called the Patriots the Lannisters of the NFL, and in GOT the lannisters are the bad guys, so I  mean I put two and two together agent_2:LOL.  That makes sense!  How about you, are you a fan of the Patriots at all? agent_1:well yes I am actually, I hope Tom Brady wins today, but to be honest I can't say I know a lot about football, I think it is good that their coach, Belichick is the coach with the most wins in the NFL	agent_2:I am a fan as well, because it seems like they always do more with less.  That said they have lost their fair share of Super Bowls too and have the same number as the Buffalo Bills.
8025	agent_1:I am as there places in the world where people do not have open and free elections. I vote in every election either in person or by mail in ballot. It's my duty as a citizen and my right.  agent_2:I agree.  I would rather choose my path than have someone chose it for me agent_1:Though you can still see how voters can be swayed by things that have little to do with a candidates beliefs, like the beards, or who was a taller candidate.	agent_2:Yes, for example, How FDR's people never allowed him to be photographed in a wheelchair.
205	agent_1:I'm sure she loves the pet, but she has to make a choice if the pet is harming her fiance. agent_2:Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described. I'm sure they can find one to agree on.  agent_1:Did you ever hear that animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated?  That's a new one to me.  	agent_2:That's interesting! Of the 1.5 million species, 1 million are insects! Yuck!
149739	agent_2:yes and then started his masters agent_1:he must be really smart. agent_2:Did you know Baker Mayfield was a competitive gamer?	agent_1:No I didn't know, that is so cool. It's been nice to speak with you.
18473	agent_1:He first appeared in 1939. That is a long time! agent_2:It sure is. I know I liked batman, and both my sons like him. He is pretty popular. agent_1:It's interesting that he doesn't have any superpowers.	agent_2:I know thats the best part. Anybody who wanted to could become batman. Just got to have the will power and drive to go through with it.
20338	agent_2:I know right, I bet they are regretting that decision big time Netflix is a giant of the industry now agent_1:They are for sure!  Together with youtube, they make up half of the peak internet traffic in North America.  So that means 1/2 the people online are watching videos.  lol agent_2:I guess both services are really popular did you know Netflix has 150 movies with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes? great content 	agent_1:I will have to go check that out.  Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth.  Pretty pricey but that's how they get subscribers to rent the new movies on dvd.
95463	agent_1:yeah of course, I bet they made enough from the sales to cover that and more agent_2:Are you familiar with the Nike Iverson deal? Lifetime endorsement. Can you imagine? agent_1:Yeah that is insane, $800 000 a year is a lot of money	agent_2:AND a $32 mil lump sum payment after he reaches 55. Now that is a sweet retirement!
52041	agent_1:Do you know where in PA? She is only 30 years old. she should stick to writing her own songs. ;) agent_2:Yeah that may work for her. I don't know where in PA. I do know she once donated her entire proceeds. agent_1:She seems to be a giving person. Seems to be getting into political rhetoric.	agent_2:Being famous i would imagine it changes and shapes the person you become.
76541	agent_2:A man in France pretended to be a government official, and sold the Eiffel Tower not once, but twice. Maybe he could sell the land in Nevada for the government. agent_1:Haha! I would be interested in buying Nevada if the price was right. :) It's almost a good thing that we have so many people doing so many things. It tests the system, which should bring about changes for good. But is also funny, when a man can get away with selling the Eiffel tower twice! agent_2:I bet I could sell a border wall to a gullible public. 	"agent_1:I believe it! So many people are for it, I wonder what the end outcome is going to be. When ""badguys"" can always get past a wall. I wonder sometimes, what is the real reason for that wall."
160456	agent_2:Do you know what color the Sun is? It looks yellow to me but its hard to tell when I look up at the SUn agent_1:Yes, as I mentioned before, it is acutally white.  It just looks yellow to us due to atmospheric scattering. agent_2:Oh I am sorry I forgot you mentioned that. I know the Sun is nearly 1.5 million kilometers away from Earth. That is a long trip	agent_1:Yes, that would take forever.  Neptune must move very slow.  It just recently completed it's first full orbit around the Sun since it was discovered in 1846.  This happened in 2011.
26911	agent_1:For the main it sounds beneficial.  The writer tries to link genetic engineer and extinctions of animals and insects, but I think they are separate issues. agent_2:I would have to agree with you on that. I think the rate of extinctions has most to do with us destroying their environments.  agent_1:Maybe all this research into genetics and DNA can be beneficial in the long run in terms of extinctions.  I understand they can save DNA now.	agent_2:Yeah I hope you are right, I hope they use the new info on genetics to determine just why some go extinct and just how we can save them.
80605	agent_1:How's it going? Did you know Russians made a computer that ran on water? agent_2:Hi, no, I didn't know that.  When was this and is it ongoing? agent_1:It was in 1936 but I think they stopped doing it	agent_2:Very interesting.  Do you know a lot about computers?
136926	agent_1:Ha ha, I must admit that I have been sucked into cat videos myself. I knew Google would be first but YouTube still surprises me since we have things like Yahoo and Bing also.  agent_2:I try to be as effective as possible so I try not to fall down the YouTube rabbithole where you start watching home improvement and end up watching young people get hit in the crotch with balls... agent_1:It's hard not to. I don't know how I end up watching some of the things I end up on there. I do find it funny that Justin Bieber's Baby is the most disliked video on YouTube. 	agent_2:I did not know that... As a 40 year old male,  I do not hate his music. Although I was never into that song. Do you like him?
158708	agent_2:did you know the U.S. president's guest house is bigger then the white house? agent_1:I had heard that.     The Zimbabwe thing was President Banana!     I wonder how wealthy he was. agent_2:yeah, and the president of indonesia released 3 pop albums while in office	agent_1:That is interesting.    Do you know anything more about the White House?
105597	agent_1:Who knows maybe we will watch that skill in the new Avengers movie lol, and I do, its one of my favorite activites. agent_2:Yes I love television. I like to watch it and have it on in the background even, do you like South Park? That's one of my favorite shows agent_1:I love South Park, the old Kenny dies stunt never ceases to amuse me lol	agent_2:Haha I know right. You'd think it would get old by now but it just doesn't LOL. Did you ever see the one where they make fun of Family Guy by the way?
74428	agent_2:Good call!  Yeah it was, and then old Ford started the mass production.  agent_1:Cadillac was actually a french explorer, i didnt know that. agent_2:I didn't know that either, very interesting though. 	agent_1:Did you hear about the guy who beat 90,000 people in Gran Turismo
112021	agent_1:Yes, and talking about domesticated animals, did you know that sometimes animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated? agent_2:I didnt know that, I have to check that fact I will have to check my dog like right now and see if its true agent_1:Ha, ha, ha.  Did you also know that hiccups are a holdover from early evolution when early land animals had both gills and lungs?	agent_2:No I didnt know that either you sure know a lot about animals, cool facts, I bet you dont know this but in Germany animals actually have constitutionla rights
141904	agent_1:Do you like hockey ? agent_2:I have passing knowledge of hockey, but to say I like it would be gong to far. agent_1:Did you know that the Washington Capitals won the Stanley Cup last year ?	agent_2:I was not aware of that until you mentioned it,  I used to live in DC, I should be aware.
82518	agent_1:I do like Volleyball I just to play it in highschool, what about yourself? agent_2:I've played it, but I'm not very good. Both volleyball and basketball were invented at the YMCA. Gym sports are popular at the Y. agent_1:I see, another interesting fact is that the volleyball woman play with is 7 inches shorter than the on men play with.	agent_2:I guess the net makes a huge difference in the dynamic of the game.  It's legal to use any part of your body in volleyball. Even kicking in volleyball is legal.
105283	agent_1:Hi, there. How are you on this fine fine evening? agent_2:Great! Hope you're doing well! Do you by chance happen to be a fan of Elvis? I am and thinks he deserves the medal of freedom! agent_1:I don't know much about Elvis. Is he really dead, or is he living with the aliens at Area 51? Not sure. Medal of Freedom? Now?	agent_2:It's hard to believe he's never received one considering his legendary status! Although many didn't like him because they believe he appropriated black culture and music.
89504	agent_2:Yep, I eevn been to a few games.  My wife is from the Cleveland area, we used to go to games at Camden Yards when they were in town in the 90's.  I even know they had a decent team then. agent_1:Cool, I'm a Yankee fan. Cleveland is still good today. Crazy that baseball is huge in Japan too. agent_2:You'd think they'd be aware of it's status in America, I thought a few players had come and played here.	agent_1:Yes, the Yankee's have had quite a few over the years, most recently Tanaka. The L.A. Angels have this guy Ohtani who is supposed to be like the Japanese Babe Ruth because he can hit and pitch at an elite level.
105410	agent_2:I agree with you! 80s is definitely full of great music haha, it's all so crazy that her first album went seven times platinum in the UK, that's very impressive agent_1:I remember that and felt she deserved it!!  Very talented!! agent_2:Yep I agree! It's crazy that she went to the same high school as Amy Winehouse, there must be something in that food or water in that high school that helps singing	agent_1:lol, could be!! Did you know every president with a beard was republican? Surprising
61360	agent_1:Yes, accolades are good but I don't know if I want a best selling album like Hybrid Theory and tour 320+ days in a year like Linkin Park agent_2:Agreed. I can't beleive Hybrid Theory is the best selling album of the 21st century. agent_1:Yea, and how NWA was able to go platnium with Straight Outta Compton despite no touring or airplay	agent_2:Now taht I think of it... Who buys albums these days? Everything is available streaming- probably for free somewhere.
34348	agent_2:No. Who is it? agent_1:Surprisingly it is Tom Hanks. agent_2:Oh I should have tried to guess! I probably could have guessed it was him! Did you know that Disney's Treasure Planet was one of the most expensive box office flops of all time? I hadn't even heard of the movie!	agent_1:That's probably why it was a flop. Theres another movie i heard was a flop cost 15M only made 309.00.
9882	agent_1:hmmm didn't know that. Clint eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast, pianist, and scored several films, including million dollar baby agent_2:Speaking of celebrities, Pixar has a secret room that is often visited by celebrities. I wonder what is in it. agent_1:thats awesome! Robin williams in aladdin was the first actor to start the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films.	agent_2:And apparently we even need celebrities in our kids tv shows. Carol Burnett was the first celebrity to appear in Sesame Street.
18489	agent_1:Hi, how are you? agent_2:I'm doing well, yourself? agent_1:I'm great! Are you a fan of music?	agent_2:I love music! In fact one of my favorite instruments is the piano.
50721	agent_2:I cannot say that I agree with Bill on that one. I haven't seen the film myself. What about Jack Black? Do you like him? agent_1:I saw about 5 minutes and that was enough for me.  Yeah I think he is pretty funny, how about you? agent_2:Jack is a natural comedian. The Green Lantern film was originally going to be a comedy starring Jack Black. I would like to have seen that version. I wonder what Bill Murray would have said.	agent_1:That would have been very interesting if he did get that part.
18908	agent_1:She's that teenager who's got short hair and I think she had a yellow suit. She was also in the Exorcist. I wonder if they'll be making a Deadpool 3? I hope so. agent_2:lol I never knew her name, I liked her. I hope they are making it, I would watch that for sure! Do you know who the director was? agent_1:No, I'm not sure, do you know? I know it's by 20th Century Fox but that's it. Did you know Ryan Reynold also is the voice of the mystery villain in Deadpool? That's funny!	agent_2:Who was the mystery villain, I can't remember them from that movie? I think it was something Miller as the director
11167	agent_2:I think they want them to concentrate on getting some sleep! Video games make more money then films do! agent_1:That seems odd but I guess if you add in things like facebook games, that makes sense. agent_2:and the price doesn't seem to go down for video games like it does for movies. Is there any soundtrack from a video game you like?	agent_1:Not really. I cant even think of a soundtrack for a video game. Is that a thing?
3767	agent_2:That is impressive! How often do you wear shoes by the way? I want to try on the shoes that are 5000 years old and actually perform better than current shoes agent_1:I am sure that those shoes are also much, much more expensive to manufacture although trying them on would be a pretty neat experience agent_2:They probably smell bad because they're so old, we should put dry tea bags inside of them because that will absorb the odor LOL	agent_1:I do not think that is the best idea..... It would probably damage the shoes. Maybe spraying it with bottle of febreeze would be better...
46026	agent_2:I did not know. No wonder he's always so happy. I don't know how Reebok has so much money though. agent_1:NBA players are the world's best paid athletes by average annual salary per player. They are all probably happy. agent_2:Did you hear about the hockey player that was traded for $1? I'd never want to play for that team.	agent_1:Yes, and then he went on to win four Stanley Cups. That was a mistake to trade him.
34819	"agent_1:I did not know that.  I tend to favor the Brits in both comedy and acting.  It is more actor performance and less special effects.  Monty Python is a great Brit classic comedy and has a computer science 'nerd' salute with the ""Python"" programming language! agent_2:Interesting! The Green Lantern film was supposed to be a Comedy starting Jack Black. That could have been pretty interesting, don't you think? agent_1:it definitely took a hard turn from the original plan.  How are you with a still / video camera?  I jokingly claim that they invented digital cameras just for me because I am a horrible photographer.  I can take 100 digital pics to get 1 good one!"	"agent_2:I can take a photo, but I'm not cinematographer! Did you know the word cinematography used to refer to the art, process, or job of filming movies, but now it just means ""motion picture photography""?"
62584	agent_1:Yeah, it was seen as a flop in comparison to other Star Wars films among some of the critics. agent_2:Do you know what the total value of the franchise was estimated at in 2018? agent_1:I would think it would be in the billions?	agent_2:It was estimated at right around 65 billion
163013	agent_2:Ah I gotcha, yah it would be hard to be a female in the NFL for sure. Do you have a favorite team out of the 32 in the NFL? agent_1:I do!  I like the Cleveland Browns. agent_2:Nice, I think they should be pretty good in the future years, Kareem Hunt is a good addition. You know much about Kim Jong-Un?	agent_1:I know that he has started to edit pictures to depict a different history just as previous communist leaders Mao and Stalin did.
76825	agent_2:I like to see Shakespeare in an era appropriate language and accent. I have seen several plays where they try to modernize it. That doesn't work. I like the costumes too. agent_1:Did you see Romeo & Juliet with Clair Danes and Leonardo Dicaprio? I had a hard time following that! agent_2:I did like that. I think if you read the play first you can follow it better. I don't know how the actors memorize all of those words and still say them with a clear meaning.	agent_1:Nice chatting with you!
17518	agent_2:I bet its videos that that are sexually suggestive. Nudity or some sort.  agent_1:Oh, that makes sense. yeah those should be removed.  agent_2:Yeah. Who would have thought three former Paypal employees would create such as a global platform. Everyone knows about Youtube I'm pretty sure its so popular..	agent_1:It would have been great to have invested in the company much earlier!
23531	"agent_1:That is really incredible!  I wonder if Amazon charges more for Strait's music or does something else to help his sales not that he needs any help but they are family after all. agent_2:Sure. George is great musician and both are family friends. That all only. agent_1:Do you think country music would be popular today if Henry Ford hadn't been so afraid of jazz music and it's ""urban decadence""?"	agent_2:Henry ford helped the popularization of country music to make popular world wide.
8663	agent_2:I know one of my kids used to play the Kim Kardashian app on their phone. I think it came out in 2014. agent_1:Sorry about that, I accidentally pressed enter. I haven't used the app, but I have heard of it. She was also in a fall out boy music video. I wonder which song? agent_2:I did not know she was in a music video. I know after the 2007 sex tape leak she and her family began appearing on E! reality TV show Keeping up With the Kardashians.	agent_1:Yeah, that's a really lucky break for releasing a sex tape. I'm pretty sure her mom released it on purpose.
39315	agent_2:That's what I've read. Speaking of baseballs, 160,000 of them are used during one major league baseball season. agent_1:there are about 2500 games per season. that is a lot of baseballs per game. agent_2:Wow, that is a lot. I only catch a handful of them during one season.	agent_1:Yes, i have caught a couple of them. I usually give them to kids. Anyway, great chat!
41861	agent_2:As I said, I follow them mildly. Actually Kyrie Irving is the only player I know on this year's team. agent_1:Well Iverson signed an amazing deal. He has a lifetime endorsement with Reebok. It pays him $800,000 per year until age 55 and then a lump sum of $32,000,000! agent_2:Wow, that a lot of money. The reading mentioned that NBA players are the best paid professional athletes on average.	agent_1:I had heard that as well. Did you know that Air Jordan's were banned in the NBA when introduced?
156797	"agent_2:I remember some sort of movie about the dictator not feeding his people and there were riots or something. Isnt there some dictator or something from back in the day? Am I think of a different country? agent_1:I'm not sure, there are hundreds of countries and only fifty current dictators. But typically, the title of ""president"" refers to the head of state of a republic government. agent_2:I thought China had a president for life or something. In authoritarian regimes, a dictator or leader of a one-party state may also be called a president. "	agent_1:That's true, but as I said, there aren't that many of them anymore and Indonesia is definitely a democratic republic.
161226	agent_1:He won the heismen trophy right? so that must mean theres a lot of talent hidden inside agent_2:Yeah exactly. I also like the NFL and wish Tebow stayed in that league. Crazy that the first NFL game was played back in 1932. agent_1:Do you have a favority NFL team? AFC or NFC?	agent_2:Yeah my team is the Seahawks. you? Russel Wilson is the man and he still is under an MLB contract!
36716	agent_2:I did not know that lol. I am one of the 93 percent that don't read them. I should start, I may have sold my soul to the devil for all i know! agent_1:I hope the Library of Alexandria deletes terms of service from their saved copy of the internet agent_2:I hope so too. Did you know you can get cellular and internet access from mt everest if youre ever interested	agent_1:That's pretty crazy you can get 3g on Mt Everest yet I can't get it in my basement
110229	agent_2:Agreed. Have you ever seen the simpsons or south park? agent_1:yeah, i have seen both. i like the old simpsons from the 80s late 90s. agent_2:Me too. There's only one simpsons with out bart: Four great ladies and a manicure.	agent_1:yeah, that doesnt sound like something that would involve bart. I guess he had a role in everything else though.
39995	agent_1:Since 1998! You'd think I would have known that sooner but there is no indication of that on the website.  agent_2:Wow! Oh, I never noticed this before, but apparently Amazon has a contract with the US postal service to deliver packages on Sundays?  agent_1:I had heard that but maybe it's just in big cities because I always have to wait until Monday. I'm online far too much. How about you?	agent_2:I believe I had a package come on a Sunday, but I always thought I got lucky. haha
1864	agent_1:The microwave is great and fast, I agree. Making Icecream is a great way to cool down when it gets too hot. We also tend to use box fans. agent_2:We use a fan for sure. Also started using like a slow cooker or toaster oven not as hot and now can fit up to a whole chicken. agent_1:Great appliances help to cook! We love our air-fryer. Though it tends to eat up the area some, so we open the doors and dim the lights to help with the heat.	agent_2:I heard some people turn their wrist upside down  to get their blood flowing to stay cool.
154304	agent_2:That's true.  It may also depend on if they are right or left handed. I mean, Kellan Moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl. agent_1:That's pretty cool, Paul D. Hubbard was a deaf qb and invented the circular huddle to prevent signal stealing agent_2:For real?  I had no idea there ever was a deaf qb!  And that's how the huddle began?	agent_1:Yep, pretty cool that no one thought of the circular huddle before Hubbard
10741	agent_1:I wonder how that happens. ANy guesses? agent_2:It's got to be something in the sound frequency agent_1:Yea I'm just wondering what is in that which activates a fear in our human emotion. I wonder if we get that from animals??	agent_2:We could have I am sure there are certain sound that cause them to fear
39773	agent_1:Yeah. Do you like birds at all? agent_2:I wish I knew alot more about birds, I think it would be alot of fun to go out and bird watch! seems like a good exercise and an interesting hobby agent_1:Yeah, I do bird watching from time to time and it is fun. Nice chatting with you	agent_2:Every once in a while I see a bird and kind of wonder what that is or if it was a rare occurrence, enjoyed chatting!
63101	agent_2:Yeah, and i think youtube and netflix combined takes up over half  the bandwidth used on the internet agent_1:That's nuts, like Gangnam style forcing youtube's view count integer to go 64 bits agent_2:Yeah i know right... or justin bieber's song baby being the most disliked!	agent_1:Well I got to go, it was nice chatting with you
92992	agent_2:Thats a classic lol, did you watch the parady of Twitlight on the show? agent_1:I think I did. Was it any good? agent_2:It was good, really funny, Daniel Radcliff voiced Edward Cullen.	agent_1:I did see that! Nice chatting with you!
145038	agent_2:The technology in phones have come a long way. For instance, an iphone has greater computing power than the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent. agent_1:yes that is kind of interesting and also scary, are you from the USA? apparently women were not allowed to wear pants in the senate until 1993 which is crazy agent_2:I am and that is quite bizarre, but there sure are some obscure rules. For instance, a senator invoked an obscure rule to allow the sergeant at arms to arrest absent senators and bring them into the chamber for a vote. One even tried to escape and was caught and carried into the senate	agent_1:yes that is very strange, also crazy that Richard Nixon broke a gavel that was 165 years old, that would suck!
77060	agent_1:WOw. He onlce raised 6 millions for charity by televising the decision agent_2:Nice. He also has a photographic memory and remembers things vividly agent_1:WOw he just has too many talents overall	agent_2:True, do you like Tim Duncan?
81124	agent_1:Wow I guess that makes sense. Did you know the Loch Ness Monster is protected? agent_2:WOw but has anyone ever seen that creature in the water .? agent_1:Nope , no one yet. Do you use Facebook much?	agent_2:I use it from time to time. Did you know it is mentioned in one third of divorce filings?
95633	"agent_2:""Bend it like Beckham?"" literally, then? Did you ever have issues w/concussions? Should kids not head balls? agent_1:yes. um there is some concern about heading the ball, especially children. i havent heard about concussions. agent_2:Okay. Understand Qatar is hosting 2022 World Cup. Maybe that has something to do w/Saudi resentment...Who knows! I'll still watch the games. Thanks for so much useful soccer info. "	agent_1:Sure. Qatar is a rich country, but there have been problems with worker deaths. Anyway, thanks for the chat!
87615	agent_1:True. Do you know why facebook is bue? agent_2:Yes it is because Mark is green red colorblind agent_1:Yeah. In parts of Germany, the like button is illegal	agent_2:Yes and I wonder what prompted them to do that
102859	agent_2:Oh, yes. I love computers and learning about them. In fact, I found out recently that the Russians once made a computer back in 1936 that ran on water. That is amazing! agent_1:That is amazing! I wonder how they did it, I also wonder how a space shuttle can only run on one megabyte of ram, my computer has 16 gigabytes LOL agent_2:I know, that is truly puzzling, isn't it? Hey, speaking of which, someone built a 16 bit computer using only basic building blocks from Minecraft. Ha!	agent_1:That is really cool! I wonder how they did it though, do you have an iPhone by the way? Don't let anyone smoke near it, Apple will void the warranty because they think that is a Biohazard
83446	"agent_1:ya I like them as well, do you like the rapper Drake? He apparently graduated high school when he was 25 agent_2:I really am not a fan but it's because I haven't really listened to a lot of his music yet. agent_1:ya I have heard some of his stuff, he spent a large amount of money on the first editions of winnie the pooh and charlottes web for some reason"""	"agent_2:That is a trip! I guess he has some emotional attachment to the stories from childhood, I don't know? I heard that Tupac's music is in the library of congress of ""cultural significance."
145805	agent_2:Canada is awash in rules and regulations. Probably something about not too much American stuff on there.  agent_1:Close!  They have a law stating that all radio stations are required to play 40 percent of music made in Canada.   agent_2:The Canadian artists just can't compete against the Americans. The Americans have louder instruments, plus they're taller. These advantages mean that Canadians struggle in their own market.	agent_1:Taller?  I feel we're about the same height as them.  Canada's president was as tall as Barack Obama.  Or should I call him Renegade.  That was Obama's secret service codename.
19977	agent_1:For sure, I like reading in general, poetry is nice agent_2:Poetry has been around for a long time, since prehistoric times with hunting poetry in Africa. agent_1:Wow, I would be interested in hearing that poetry! Have you read the raven?	agent_2:I have! I heard Edgar Allan Poe did not receive very much money for it!
111436	agent_2:Do not mess with a lightning bolt! An internet connection is a right in Finland. I would be great to have that in the US> agent_1:Oh wow, that is good for them! Did you know that on the peak of Mt Everest you can get cell service and internet? How crazy is that! agent_2:I bet they have to use a satellite for that. Otherwise, the IT guy would have to climb Everest to restart the WIFI.	agent_1:Hahahaa, wouldn't want that job!
161540	agent_1:It always saddens me to see people mistreat those who survived something as horrific as the Holocaust agent_2:It's definitely sad. People and governments can often leave others without the best support. agent_1:They can be, but they can do really good things too! The Amazon can thank the Norwegian government for donating $1 billion to help save the rainforest	agent_2:That's so neat! People in government can be super cool, I guess. Like the Indonesian president, who has recorded several pop albums during his time in office.
58585	agent_2:I have my 1 click buying setting off so I don't make too many spontaneous purchases! They hold the patent on that and Apple pays them licensing fees. agent_1:Ya I still haven't used that feature. Feel that it could and would be dangerous. However, what Amazon has done right aside from quality merchandise is great customer service and delivery agent_2:That's true. Do you read books on the Kindle? Amazon created a new font that is designed to be easily read on kindles and other digital screens.	agent_1:I have been transitioning more to audiobooks personally. It is easier on my eyes
164346	agent_2:That sounds pretty interesting! Apparently the NFL has no written rules about females joining.  agent_1:Really? so females could also play? that is a bit unusual I don't think I have the stomach to watch that. agent_2:Yeah, but they would have to be pretty strong to meet the requirements I imagine. I wonder if there have been any females in the NFL?	agent_1:I don't think so I haven't seen one at least. Interesting how players have tracking chips in their shoulders
42980	agent_1:oh for sure, crazy that it started back in 2005, that seems so long ago agent_2:Yes, I remember both YouTube and Facebook becoming a big thing back in those days at pretty much the same time; did you know that Facebook was initially limited to Harvard students? agent_1:ah yes I did know that, also their like button is somehow Illegal in one of the German states, weird	agent_2:That's odd; the Like button was also originally going to be named the Awesome button, which seems kind of silly!
126049	agent_2:Do you use any other social networks? agent_1:No, I really don't feel the need to communicate to the world every detail of my life. I didn't know that MySpace had a chance to buy Facebook for only $75 million. agent_2:I sometimes feel I'm quite addicted to social networks, not in terms the amount of time I spend, but in terms how much I rely: checking news, chat with friends, etc. 	agent_1:I try to get news from other sources, and use email to chat with friends. What about Burger King's promotion to unfriend people? Do you think that was effective? I doubt it.
80215	agent_1:Haha. It is apparently because they have high case of carjackings. agent_2:Well, ever since cars started being used globally, there will always be people wanting to steal them agent_1:That's sad, but true. Do you follow any celebrities?	agent_2:Mostly athletes.  I tend to stay away from the reality stars.
81286	agent_2:Lol, I remember Will Ferell's character used it in a basketball movie he made. I think it was Semi-Pro. agent_1:That sounds right. He looks like he could play a goofy basketball player that doesnt care about form. agent_2:Yea, he played the owner of a team in the 70s that only bought the team to play on it lol	agent_1:That sounds funny. i will have to check that out. I enjoyed him in Anchorman.
156555	agent_2:Or he is a better singer than politician?  You know, until 1805, the runner up in the election for President autiomatically became VP. But that was back when both candidates were nationalists and had the interests of the US at heart..  agent_1:I agree, totally. back in the 1800's I think it was such an honor to become president of this country that the politicians worked more closely together. The role of the president is supposed to be prominent and encompassing. But, now-a-days, they attacj each other on every front. It's a pity, really. agent_2:They need a good humbling!  I heard a story about NBA hall-of-famer, Reggie Miller, and how he was humbled. As it turns out, he was coming home after a great performance and chose to brag to his family about his 40-pt game. As it turned out, his sister ad just scored 105 pts in her game, breaking 8 national records. That is humbling!	"agent_1:Yeah, he probably needed that wake-up call!  Also, did you know that physicists proved that shooting a basketball ""granny style"" is the best way to score points on the line but that the NBA players won't do it because it looks so stupid?"
36708	agent_2:that is a good point, lol. There is a free online magazine called the redditor, have you checked it out? agent_1:No I haven't check out the Redditor yet, I wonder what they cover agent_2:Me too, probably everything regarding the internet and computers	agent_1:I wonder if they wrote an article about user kn0thing's first post on reddit
139396	agent_1:hey my friend do you watch football at all? agent_2:Yes, I do . I am fan. How about you? agent_1:yes I am a fan, I am not a fan though of iowa painting their opposing teams locker rooms pink haha	agent_2:Agree, interesting in other countries they call soccer, football
15184	agent_2:I did not know that. i know that the band did over 300 concerts in one year. they were popular. agent_1:Wow that's a lot of concerts. Reel Big Fish lost their rights to their original record label so they re-recorded all of their albums. agent_2:That must have been a headache, but i guess they wanted to hold onto their music. good for them!	agent_1:Yep. The Dark Side of the Moon is still one of the best selling albums.
124919	agent_1:i didnt keep count bet yes ive been a fan of the simpsons pretty much all of my ife..did you know When south park aired its family guy episode finale the producers received flowers from the simpsons crew agent_2:No,  thats awesome!!!Daniel radcliffe voiced the cartoon parody of twilight's edward cullen on the simpsons episode treehouse of horror xxi. agent_1:those halloween episodes were always good. always a surprise	agent_2:Absolutely!  Have u ever been to universal studios?  They have a simpsons area and ride,  really fun
69502	"agent_2:I found that number to be a little high, too. I do accidentally trip over my dogs, because they are often underfoot. But, I also used to work for an emergency department, and I don't remember too many ""tripped over dog"" chief complaints.  agent_1:naah, it's sounds made up. My chocolate English lab is in the same color as my floor, but I've never actually tripped over him... I kicked him couple of times by accident, but nothing more ;) agent_2:Do you apologize to your dog when you accidentally trip over him? I do. I even find myself saying ""excuse me"" sometimes to my dogs! LOL!"	"agent_1:Of course ! I always say ""sorry buddy, I didn't see You there"" and I really think he understands :)"
34251	agent_2:no I don't, what was it? I think the first person who bought something on amazon did get a building named after him though agent_1:Yeah good call you are right.  I guess they spend a whopping $27.95, I wonder what year that was in though.  agent_2:ya it must have been in the 90's at some point, do you like the movie the dark knight rises?	agent_1:Yeah I think you are right.  Yeah I have, I think the whole series is pretty good.  How about you?
154611	agent_2:It will be interesting to see what they do. , maybe McDaniels will stay instead of going to coach the colts. Gronkowski's future seems unsure. He's only 29 but has had a number of injuries. agent_1:I think these guys have to consider life after football. They will retire and will need to use that body later on. agent_2:I think so too, I think he and his wife Gisele have a few kids, and she makes more money even than he does. I would want to settle down and enjoy life before I get too old and sore.	agent_1:Enjoy time with your kids. He can coach, too. Anyway, I enjoyed chatting!
134538	agent_2:Yes I couldn't even look at pictures of that to be honest. I kept seeing it pop up and would scroll quickly. It was too heartbreaking. They are very loyal animals.  agent_1:It was heartbreaking to watch him lay at the foot of the casket. agent_2:Yes it definitely was. Apparently he had not had him very long. They obviously formed a quick bond. It's touching.	agent_1:They even brought him in to visit the casket in the Rotunda of the capital and he was so well mannered and behaved. He captured Americas heart then.
17142	agent_1:HA! So I am guessing yes... Are you there just for this? agent_2:Yes and a few other things but this mainly. Libraries are awesome.  agent_1:I agree. There's a library that offers sewing machine check out!	agent_2:Wow that sounds pretty cool, better not drop it or you bought it though!.
8398	agent_1:She really does. It's not a superhero thing, but Earth will be helium-free by the end of the 21st century, I wonder what kind of impact that would bring, do you know? agent_2:I am not sure, it is probably something I should know.  Humans have done a lot of damage to the planet. agent_1:Yeah I agree, especially when the FDA burns through six tons of literature in an act of US censorhip	agent_2:That is so wasteful.  Did you know winston chruchills prize was in Literature, not peace?
104673	agent_1:Yes and the republicans seem to be leading the way right now 3 points agent_2:I think that would be interesting to watch.  agent_1:I agree. Did you know that Fantasy COngress actually exists?	agent_2:I've heard of that, I guess points are based off legislative success?
44395	agent_1:Oh, how sweet!  Now I'm going to have to call my son and tell him. We loved that movie. Sometimes I feel like I'm on the phone all day. agent_2:me too, where would we be without that invention! Did you know an iPhone has more computing power than the entire us nuclear ICBM deterrent system? agent_1:That is insane! Have you ever used a rotary phone?	agent_2:I used to play around with an old one in my Granny's basement when I was younger, it was so cool. have you?
96597	agent_2:I do!  He played in Black Panther. agent_1:He did, that was a good movie for sure. Did you ever watch him in the wire? agent_2:I can't say that I have.  Is that a tv show or movie?	agent_1:It's a TV show, he played a character named Wallace, it's the best show ever, he did a pretty good job as Kilmonger in Black Panther though. You know who Maya Angelou is?
157792	agent_1:Yeah apparently the guy has already released 3 albums agent_2:Thats so cool, Trump should collaborate with Kanye, they make a great couple and they might even reach platinum agent_1:Yeah well. Did you know the senate had a gavel that lasted for 165 years	agent_2:I didnt, although a senator holds the record for the longest filibuster, its of 24 hours and 18 minutes non stop
79536	agent_2:Seems clunky - kickball makes sense and describes the sport pretty accurately I think.  Why don't they call hockey soccer-ice skating with sticks? agent_1:Haha I like that idea! What do you think about husband and wife combo they used to schedule all of the MLB games? They would schedule about 2500 games a year, I bet they were busy all the time! agent_2:I thought a computer set the schedule - there's so much to keep track of and the travel time and geographical logistics.  It hurts my brain to think about setting up the schedule for 30 teams, 162 games...	agent_1:Yeah that would be a ton to keep track of! Do you use a telephone by the way? I bet they definitely had to to schedule those games haha
74787	agent_1:hi, do you listen to the radio? agent_2:Yes, I do.  What about you? agent_1:yes me too. do you listen to the am or fm?	agent_2:Mostly FM, when I'm on my commute to work every day.  I read somewhere that soldiers in WWII made simple radios using a razorblade and a pencil as the diode.  How cool is that?
113509	agent_1:I've read about this guy who's a diver for golf courses, he finds lots of balls (sometimes even entire sets of clubs!) when he goes down into the water! agent_2:He must have a lot of balls then, does he get to keep them? agent_1:Actually he cleans them and resells them to various golf shops.  Sounds like a neat way to make money.  	agent_2:It does sound like a great business idea, some balls must be worth a lot specially the ones used in pro tournaments
139751	agent_1:hey do you ever watch NBA games? agent_2:I have I love watching NBA games, do you? agent_1:ya I do like watching them, theyd be a lot more boring without the dunk though, did you hear that they tried to ban that?	agent_2:No, what happened? did they actually ban the dunk shot?
36096	agent_1:Wow that's great! I hear it grossed over 1 billion at the box office. agent_2:that is amazing but it is a great movie so good job all around agent_1:Disney renamed one of there famed titles to tangled as well as snow queen.	agent_2:yeah, apparently feminine titles do not do very very in the box office
99295	agent_2:No I haven't, I heard only celebrities were able to enter the secret room? Is there another room that's available to the public? agent_1:No but I really want to go into that room. What do you think is in there? agent_2:A collection of all the characters from Pixar movies, do you have a favorite Pixar movie?	agent_1:I loved toy story. I had no idea Steve Jobs was the CEO there, between his apple stints.
144928	agent_1:I did not know that I wonder if it is still around, the device? agent_2:I'm sure it is. I knew there had to be a bit of a trick to that. I feel bad for ballet dancers feet. They go through 4 pairs of shoes per week! agent_1:That is crazy. Babies apparently spontaneously dance to music	agent_2:That's amazing. I knew they seemed inclined to dance quite early. Did you know that Bruce Lee could dance?
130801	agent_2:Yeah I guess they are everywhere in the news. Do you know who are the three wealthiest presidents in the US? agent_1:yes JFK, Washington, and Jefferson agent_2:Yeah. The president of Indonesia is a pop star on top of being a president	agent_1:did you know that elmo is the only non-human to testify before the U.S. congress? I did not know that
62311	agent_2:I would have broken my phone too many times to justify playing that game. Im too competitive. agent_1:Really? so we have that common, what kind of games do you like? agent_2:I used to like first shooter games but then I had kids 7 years ago and now I like fathering...	agent_1:Yeah, no time for video games when you have kids, I used to play a lot I liked the early Mario Bros games.
39968	agent_2:haha or me when I'm hungry haha, what I do want is to put a flame thower on my car like you can in South Africa agent_1:That is crazy,  they must a have a pretty bad car theft problem.  agent_2:haha well ya, I would use it to melt snow right now though haah	agent_1:Thats what I was thinking it could be better used for!  If they used made a flame thrower user friendly it would make a ton of money selling to people who live in the snowy areas.
54485	agent_2:Yes, seems like it's about a magical house. agent_1:The whole movie is pretty much about magic, and how to learn magic. agent_2:It seems the movie also have just a little bit of suspense! 	agent_1:It does, and an underlying message really. It's making a statement about how not all kids learn the same way, and our current education system doesn't support that.
154827	agent_1:I didn't know that. agent_2:Yea, Antoine Cadillac founded Detroit agent_1:I should have known, I'm from there.	agent_2:DId you know Mcdonalds' added drive-thru in 1975 to accommodate soldiers who were not allowed to get out of their cars while wearing their fatigues?
28981	agent_2:Yes, I love TV. I heard that Hough Laurie gets $700,000 for every episode in house. I would not know what to do with all that money.  agent_1:Me either, but he's worth it.  I never knew he was British until I heard him being interviewed one time on tv and he was speaking British and I was like OMG, I would have never known, he's just that good.  House is one of my favorite tv shows, though.  I wish it was still on. agent_2:Yes, I did not know that either. Erin from the office was taught by Jon Haumm. 	agent_1:That's an interesting tidbit.  Well, it's been nice chatting with you this morning, I have to go and walk my dog.  Talk to you later, friend.
121786	agent_1:yeah.  agent_2:In class they also discussed the history of clothing. Did you know that humans are the only creature that wears clothes? I didn't know that, ha ha. agent_1:I think they should put pants on horses... my son asks too many questions at the petting zoo.	agent_2:The class learned that we wear more or less clothes depending on the circumstances.  For instance if it's cold we wear more and if it's hot we wear less.  Also different cultures wear different types of clothes.
155599	agent_2:I don't know, I get tired of listening to Laura Ingraham and Ann Coulter and their anti-Clinton nonsense.  They practically made themselves in the 1990s bashing the Clintons among others. agent_1:yes, that's why Fox News is so popular if you ask me.  I like Bill Clinton, but Hillary is another story.  Wasn't Richard Nixon a democrat?  Fox News was created by him and Richard Ailes.. agent_2:No Nixon was a Republican, he ran against Kennedy, a democrat, who was one of the top three wealthiest presidents in American history.	agent_1:Right...  i should have known that.  The White House's guest house is bigger than the WH itself.  funny...
114413	agent_1:Also, did you know when South Park aired its Family Guy episode, they got flowers from the Simpson's crew?  agent_2:Wow I didn't know that. Pretty cool they gave them flowers.  agent_1:Yeah. I wonder how many episodes of the Simpsons there even are? I know there are over 750 episodes of Pokemon! 	agent_2:I know there are a ton because it's been going on for 30 years. Tons of Pokemon episodes too!
149820	agent_2:even the supreme court justices like basketball...the highest court in the land!  agent_1:With only 9 justices, I don't think they can have a proper game. Well, I enjoyed chatting. agent_2:likewise. have a wonderful evening. 	agent_1:Thanks, you too!
147200	"agent_2:I actually lose interest when they get political.  I used to like the packers because they were community owned. agent_1:That's one of the reasons I liked them too. Still do actually.  They're the only team that is community owned you know. agent_2:Kinda the same as supporting small businesses.  Gonna have to read that short story ""the last superbowl"""	agent_1:What's that about?
146548	agent_1:Yea like 15 years, he was drafted in 2004 agent_2:Wow.That's a long career. Maybe he should retire? agent_1:Yea it's probably a good time, his brother Peyton retired a couple years ago	agent_2:Ok. It runs in the family. Probably time to leave if the clock has run down.
9708	"agent_2:He might have tried the game ""Send me to heaven"" by throwing his into the air. He wouldn't have minded a shattered phone if he won agent_1:LOL. Probably not. Anyway, thanks for the chat! agent_2:He definitely wouldn't have bought anything from Apple's clothing line. Yes, good chat!"	agent_1:True. Apple clothing? LOL
163374	agent_1:Me too. Boooo! I'm a Bengals fan lol.  agent_2:Im truly sorry to hear that. Lol. agent_1:HAHA....it's all for fun. Did you know the NFL has no written rule against females playing in the league?	agent_2:maybe we'll see a female kicker.
10201	agent_1:I know! He is so clean cut in real life that his ability to fill that roll caught me off guard! agent_2:I often wonder if there is truth behind stars having to take pills or alcohol to make it through a concert like in the movie. agent_1:I think a lot of rock stars become overwhelmed with the fame. I can't imagine it is easy to have no privacy and so much demand on a person so I think it does happen a lot	agent_2:It is not all that it is cracked up to be.
83294	agent_1:Absolutely. One thing he can NEVER be called is a one hit wonder. More like a hit machine! Good for him:D agent_2:It sounds like he has studied his craft extensively too. I think that is something that is going to set him apart when it comes down to music that is going to last.  agent_1:You are right. He is a student of music. He has worked hard to be the best at his craft. He is a master of storytelling, set to amazing music.	agent_2:I didn't know he wrote for the hobbit. I love the score to that movie.
119873	"agent_1:Inventing a sport sounds super hard! I hear the US Supreme court has basketball court that's called ""the highest court in the land."" I'm not sure if it actually is or not, though. agent_2:Good question! Maybe there are other roof top courts, though it is a good play on words. I wonder if they actually go up there and shoot hoop in their robes! Ha Ha! agent_1:That is interesting! I wonder if pro basketball players were ever tried in their court and then later played with them on their basketball court there?"	agent_2:Wow, I hope not! Hope they don't get into any trouble that goes all the way to the supreme court. I think it's interesting that a basketball is almost exactly half the diameter of the rim. For some reason, I thought the rim was smaller than that.
5354	agent_1:wow didn't know that! also didn't know baseball is super popular in Japan agent_2:Very popular, but not as good as the US version. Different experience in the stadium as well. agent_1:I've heard that, funny the Japan are surprised that baseball is actually americas pasttime haha	agent_2:They have something called the Japan series. It doesn't draw the attention of the World Series.
133894	agent_1:Yeah. Your connectivity is a huge factor of where you live and what service you use. I live in a rural area and only Verizon works out here.  agent_2:I also find it hard to believe that dolphins speak on the phone and recognize each other! agent_1:Well that is fascinating. One never thinks of animals being able to distinguish between voices. 	agent_2:so nice to speak with you!
115299	agent_1:haha ya 75 million to buy them back in 2005 would have been a bargain agent_2:exactly, their loss. do you know why facebook is blue? agent_1:well I think it's because Zuckerberg is colorblind? did you know there's a state in Germany where the like button is illegal?	agent_2:Yeah that is it. I wonder why it is illegal though and how they control people
101547	agent_2:Yeah.  But should really stay away as well.  Just too depressing.  The story was filled with issues about miscommunication and racial bias.  Quite sad.   agent_1:Interesting. Did you know 86% of Nevada is owned by the government? agent_2:Wow, did not know that.  Wonder how that works.  Sometimes think there's too much government.  By definition it should be a group of people governing an organized community.  In reality, not always the case.	agent_1:Yeah, that is very true. It's also a lot of land to be owned by the government. Well, nice chatting with you!
106490	agent_1:They call it a library of things, and it is a great idea, you can avoid buying things that you will not use all the time agent_2:Yep I would love to have that haha. You should publish a book in Norway actually, they will buy at least 1,000 copies of any book that is published to put into their libraries agent_1:That is a good incentive to write more. An you know what? a better deal if you write a children's book, they will buy 1500 copies!	agent_2:LOL now you're thinking! Did you hear about the man that was falsely imprisoned for 10 years, use the library to get his law degree, freed himself, and now helps other people who have been falsely accused
52068	agent_2:That's true. Chaturanga is the name of the game it is believed to be derived from. agent_1:It has remained relatively unchanged since the Persians tweaked the game a little bit agent_2:It has ventured through a myriad of different cultures. That is amazing.	agent_1:You would think the President of World Chess would understand the history of the game a bit more rather than thinking aliens created the game
40797	agent_1:Ya it is kind of scary with how much they own, also they do employ a lot of people but I don't know that the benefits are good, did you see all the news recently about how they had no breaks and had to urinate in bottles? agent_2:I did not and I didn't know that working conditions were that extreme. I thought that Amazon touts work hard at pretty good pay and benefits, but I didn't know it was that bad. agent_1:Yes you can google it, it was really messed up, but I also see that the average warehouse worker walks between 7 and 15 miles per day, I guess that is good for exercise at least	agent_2:While I can't agree with their worker's working conditions, I must admit however that they are quit innovative. Did you know they patented the 1 click buying?
129119	agent_1:That is hard to believe they are building an entire city! agent_2:I really wanted to go to the world cup in Russia in 2018. agent_1:I would have given anything to be anywhere other than where I was, I was in the hospital with cancer.  That really sucked.	agent_2:Wow, sorry to hear that. It's interesting that the World Cup has been held every four years since 1930 except for during the Second World War.
142423	agent_1:That is true, we would have no Clintons, no Bushs, no Kennedy's, no Roosevelts.  agent_2:Very true! No telling where we'd be today if that was the case. So many generations of politicians there. Who knows how differently things could be? Heck, women weren't allowed to wear pants on the Senate floor until 1993! agent_1:I know, it's hard to think how things would have turned out. That's crazy. I heard that a D.C. judge sued a small dry cleaning business for over $67 million for the loss of a pair of pants. Those must have been some special pants. 	agent_2:Indeed they must have been. They could have been the Hulk's indestructible pants since that seems to be one of his super powers! Ha!
68229	agent_1:Of course, Netflix is available if you pay to all countries except for a few including China, Syria, and N. Korea. agent_2:Apparently they have 150 movies with a 100% rating on rotten tomatoes.  agent_1:It's impressive how much movies they have, there is one called Black Panther that stood out to me though.	"agent_2:Yeah. Apparently they pay a team of ""taggers."""
119783	agent_1:That's interesting! In other countries they are more strict, for example in Canada all radios have to have at least 40% of the music played be Canadian music. agent_2:Definitely cool.    I'm going to a website to listen to some classic radio dramas.    Have a good one! agent_1:You have a good one too!	agent_2:Thanks!     Funny to think that radio waves really are eternal.
147256	agent_1:Have a good night! agent_2:Thanks and I hope your favorite team wins the super bowl next year! agent_1:Thanks! Maybe you'll get a chance to see a live game!	agent_2:I would enjoy that at some point. I've lived in 3 cities with national teams so maybe I 'll get to see one of them play.
58738	agent_2:yes i am also think this one agent_1:Ok, better discuss another article, that cars came into worldwide use during the twentieth century, you already knew this agent_2:yes i already know	agent_1:What is the make and model of car that you admire or have
87666	agent_1:I did not! It's not as surprising as Tupac dancing ballet to me, but that's a close second! agent_2:Yes! and Tupac acted in the nutcracker as the mouse king!! agent_1:That's super cool honestly. Wish he was still around. I thought that projection of him from a few years back was creepy. 	agent_2:He was way different back then.. I learned about an aluminum piano that weighed only 356 pounds
45203	agent_2:It is amazing how much he was able to determine without all of the technology that we have today. Not only was he able to determine that gravity existed but he developed many mathematical equations that we still use today.  agent_1:I know! I wish Tycho Brahe had some credit too though.  agent_2:I am not familiar with Tycho Brahe. Who is he or she?	agent_1:Isaac Newton built upon his work.
70501	"agent_1:Hello,  do you like rap or rapping? agent_2:I do enjoy some of it. Although, I recently heard a Kanya West song with lyrics comprised mostly of ""poop"" so he's definitely on my questionable list now. agent_1:Oh wow,  I haven't heard this song before,  I gotta look it up after this.  Although,  I am not a fan of his,  I really dont understand why he thinks he is the greatest rapper ever,  I don't even like his songs"	agent_2:Sorry, I meant to say Kanye. My friends and I always say Kanya, though. The song is called Lift Yourself. I think he wrote it himself.
92933	agent_1:Why do they remove the coconuts? agent_2:I imagine so they dont fall on him agent_1:I didnt even know India had coconut trees lol	agent_2:lol yeah thats interesting
14983	agent_2:Honestly, I don't know why the concept that animals can give eachother blood transfusions never occured to me. However, dogs have adapted very well to living with humans. agent_1:The stray dogs are spared in Istanbul due to generous recyclers who put0 their recyclables in a machine that dispenses food and water to them. agent_2:That is very fascinating. Considering how many people love their pets, I think that would definitely motivate some people to recylce more. I didn't get to ask, do you like most animals like dogs or snakes?	agent_1:I sort of like dogs, but snakes no way!  I respect that they are such stealthy animals that can swallow prey bigger than their heads though!
79346	agent_2:Very true.  The world has certainly become a scary place.  On a much happier note, are you a fan of animals? agent_1:I'm a dog person but other than that no, I don't like cats, what about you? agent_2:I would say I'm a cat person, only because Im on the go and they are a little more independent.  I think it is cool that some dogs in Russia has learned to use the subway.  I wonder if they do that independently?  Like, where would they have to go apart from their humans?	agent_1:Dogs can be really smart, with elephants they are the only animals that understand poiting, plus dogs are loyal animals.
157343	agent_2:Is he really? I like him as a QB I think he is really talented.  agent_1:Yes he is. He took a bunch of AP classes in high school and got his degree in 2 years! agent_2:That is admirable do you like Baker Mayfield, he seems like a smart QB also.  	agent_1:Yeah he is pretty good. He was really good at Halo 3 in college.
33101	agent_1:Yes it is. The earth and the moon causes ocean tides. I love to walk the beach at night looking at the moon. Its so relaxing. In the Virgin Islands the stars are unbelievable! agent_2:Is that so? I bet there's not much light pollution the way there is in more developed areas; heck, over 80% of Earth's natural forests have already been destroyed. agent_1:That's upsetting! I love nature and old trees that been around for 100 years  Wow, the earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century!	agent_2:It's amazing how much damage humans have done in such a short amount of time. If Earth's entire history was 24 hours, human existence would only be 1 minute and 17 seconds long!
55370	agent_1:have you read starship trooper? agent_2:Yes. Its very interesting. agent_1:do you go to concerts?	agent_2:Yes, A concert is a live music performance in front of an audience.
98791	agent_1:He won't make any movies that don't project positivity. You're right, he is one funny guy. agent_2:He ought to know that any movie, no matter what the genre, can be positive. I depends on the actor. agent_1:I'll stick with the thrillers and dramas, I really liked the horror books as a child, like Edgar Allen Poe, Murders in the Rue Morgue was my all-time fav.	agent_2:The man had a strange sense of the macabre, but he is a legend, and definitely a highlight of American literature.
137658	"agent_2:Im not sure but I have heard it only has a population of 445 at the school.  agent_1:They have students from China, France, and Canada where football isn't as popular. agent_2:Yes but it brings them all together and bonds them. Mike Yang said â ""One thing I really love about football is the sense of responsibility that players have."""	agent_1:The coach seems to have a positive attitude saying his priority is to make everyone feel welcomed and give it a try.
47566	agent_2:I too find electricity interesting. I was sad to hear of the death of Frances L. Lloyd, she was a scientist who helped come up with the concept of the volt. agent_1:Yes, a remarkable woman.  Her work enabled so much progress. agent_2:She worked at several institutes where she was a key member that helped develop the reference volt.	agent_1:In her time her work and recognition were unusual.
117325	agent_2:Sad, we could have been to Mars by now, but people are just introvering themselfs. I am just waiting for the aliens to take over. Wont take much.  agent_1:Unless the Aliens are like us: more focused on entertainment than exploration!  agent_2:Exactly, but god help us if they are more Klingon like. All we need its aliens who are slightly more advanced and outgoing. 	agent_1:They could use Google Maps to help plan their military attack. Track our devices to figure out where we are.
66605	"agent_2:My favorite is actually Tupac. I think it's awesome that his music is in the Library of Congress. agent_1:Yes you're right, they said that his work had""cultural significance"" what do you think about Eminem by the way agent_2:I didn't like him, until five years ago. Did his voice change, like Elton John's did?"	agent_1:I'm not sure did it change? I just know that when he was a kid his favorite superhero with Spider-Man, I definitely would not have guessed that
48558	agent_1:Not in a long time. I heard she makes a lot of money, though! agent_2:Yes, 123,000 dlls per episode. Can you imagine that? I guess Carol Burnett never made that money. What do you think? agent_1:She probably barely made that in a year. She was the first to guest star on Sesame Street though. 	agent_2:Yes, loved Sesame Street! I was reading about Robin Williams, he was one of the starters performing voices in animated films, I miss him so much!
46111	agent_2:I do not use the Facebook because I feel like it wastes my time plus there have been problems with the privacy.  agent_1:Yes, it is not what is used to be since it became a public company in 2012. Once they monetized the sight it became an overwhelming ad push site. agent_2:I do not need more ads in my life. Myspace could have had FB for a song. They turned down an offer to buy facebook for $75 million in early 2005	agent_1:That was a mistake for myspace. It is funny how they both used the same color blue on their site and logo. I guess it was because Mark Zuckerburg is color blind and needs to stick to the primary colors.
119007	agent_1:Yep! That sounds about right. Pretty impressive stats! Do you go to concerts? agent_2:I try to go to a few each year.  I prefer them to be in sports stadiums but outside concerts are nice when the weather is nice. agent_1:I like going to outside concerts. I am amazed at how much some of these bands tour. Linkin Park played in 324 concerts in 2001 alone!	agent_2:That is impressive.  In croatia there is an ancient roman amphitheatre that is still in use.
67924	agent_2:Germany does a lot of things right. but then they also have those crazy restrictions against some movies and forms of art. crazy.  agent_1:That's true. They're not the only country to have restrictions on things though. On the other hand, sometimes things are more popular in other countries. The Nintendo system wasn't discontinued in Japan until late 2003 agent_2:yea i guess people just kept playing in for various reasons. i cant imagine how. there were two systems after that by then.	agent_1:If it's the Nintendo 64 system, I can understand. I'll still jump at the chance to play those games such as Mario Kart, despite the system only displaying 54 colors
3893	agent_2:I think it is amazing! Not only the composition and history of earth, but also its position relative to other planets in the solar system. agent_1:I agree, so many wonders to think we only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds on a 24 hour calendar of Earth's history. agent_2:What do you mean?	agent_1:I mean that if 4.5 billion years of histoy equals 24 hours then humans have only exist for 1 minute and 17 seconds of that 24 hour period,
11872	agent_2:There was a group of climbers that climbed Britain's tallest mountain and found a piano on top! agent_1:That is the craziest fact I have heard so far.  I wonder why someone would do that.  agent_2:I don't know but it is pretty cool! Pianos are very old instruments created in 1700!!	agent_1:That is old, I wonder how much some of those pianos if they are still around are worth today?
93899	agent_1:Ok, that makes sense. i usually drive old cars. there is no arrow in those.  agent_2:Oh, I'll have to look at one of our older cars.  agent_1:Yeah, not much technology there. no self-driving, no aggressive mode. LOL. Anyway, great chat!	agent_2:Yeah, good chatting with you too!
89868	agent_1:He's amazing,  I still am not over him not being here anymore.  He was fantastic in Aladdin! agent_2:Absolutely. I miss Carol Burnett, too. She was the first celebrity to appear on Sesame Street! agent_1:That was a great show,  who was your favorite character?	agent_2:Oh, I'm not sure. I haven't been interest in that show for decades. But speaking of nostalgia, did you know they're making a sequel to Space Jam?
67193	agent_1:Yeah to be honest I do not so I must not be in that percentage. Do you listen to music? agent_2:Yes, I do.  How about you?  I still buy albums instead of downloading songs online. agent_1:Oh nice, yeah I like them. Did you know Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory is the best selling album of this century?	agent_2:No, I did not. I'm not surprised though because i have the album.  I heard that the main singer committed suicide.
112460	agent_1:Are you interested in government much? I think it's funny that the government had a plan to destory Wikileaks. And Wikileaks published the plan. agent_2:Yeah that is pretty funny they did that.  Did you know the government actually shut down 3 times in 1977? agent_1:It think Carter was having a lot of problems with Congress. The most recent shutdown was the longest ever, I believe. And it might continue in a couple of weeks, who knows.	agent_2:Yeah who knows, but I think you are right about that.  Did you know the Chinese government censored the word, censorship? Isn't that crazy?
18799	agent_1:haha that is them, I think it's impressive that NWA released an album that went platinum without any airplay or a tour agent_2:The streets saw the talent and supported them. I don't think NWA could do a clean version for Walmart. Wouldn't be any lyrics left. agent_1:haha just release a blank cd! Do you do fantasy football? apparently they have fantasy spelling bees haha	agent_2:I guess people will place a wager on anything. I wonder who majors in Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature in college. Seems like a waste.
17505	"agent_1:I dont own a gun so i dont have much of a ""dog in this fight"" but i can see how much of the policy we have now is in place for a reason and is working.  agent_2:Right. I guess we can all agree to disagree. One thing that we can agree on is how silly it is that the first youtube video uploaded was of a guy talking about elephants! agent_1:Haha, i didnt know that! I wonder how many views it has? "	agent_2:I want to look it up and find out! Who knew Youtube began as a dating website. Would people update vidoes of themselves talking about their love interest or something?
22150	agent_1:That's cool. I'm originally from NY so that explains my preference for the Islanders. Canada is so good at hockey because it is their national sport. They're the only country with 2 national sports, agent_2:I think you're right there national sports are lacrosse and ice hockey. I guess Hockey is referred in other countries as field hockey. Only in about five countries total is it referred to as just hockey agent_1:Kind of like football/soccer I guess. On average hockey players can lose up yo 8lbs in one game. I know they must sweat like crazy.	agent_2:Wow that does sound crazy. I could use that that sounds like a great workout though haha. It's interesting that they can use the same court for basketball and hockey and they just switch the floors out
163001	agent_2:I did know that. I came in second and was understanding since he has that sweet haircut. agent_1:Funny!  On a serious note though, China actually believes he is. agent_2:Come on China! What do your guys look like where you think he is the sexiest man alive. There has to be a hanging chad conspiracy in that election...	agent_1:True enough!  What did you think about North Korea's participation in the olympics last year?
164654	agent_2:I am a Bears fan. They actually had a good season this year until that playoff game messed it all up. How about you? agent_1:Me too! It was a nice year! I was shocked they did that well. Since our draft pick went to OAK, I wanted them to do well since our draft position would be unaffected. agent_2:Yes they did very well. Mack was a great addition. Did you know that the NFL has no written rules prohibiting female players?	agent_1:Seems like they are trying not to be sexists but the objectification of their cheerleaders seem counter to that goal.
44540	agent_2:Yes, from experience.  It's a natural thing. I guess some pro athletes and fans like to play Fortnite; particularly, some soccer fans. agent_1:Nice, that is great. Do you use the computer much? agent_2:All the time.  Did you know that the Russians mage a computer that runs on water in 1936?	agent_1:Wow that is incredible. And the space shuttle computer runs on only 1 mb of ram, that is so little
14476	agent_2:There are a lot of great tips in this article,  I also am in the process of doing the no shopping tip as well,  which is extremely hard,  but I am noticing the amount of money I save.   its only been 2 weeks but yeah big difference agent_1:I've got to make a list.  We cut away on a lot, but it's that extra credit card debt that looms large. agent_2:Oh I hear ya!  Thats what I am gonna use this extra money for,  that christmas shpping that is still on my cc lol 	agent_1:Need to run, but thanks for chatting!
67657	agent_1:Another recent one that seems to be popular is A Star Is Born, but with it being rated R, it might be better if parents watch it by themselves first before they deem whether or not their kids are mature enough for it agent_2:Yeah it seems it may be a really honest film about alcoholism and addiction, might be appropriate for older teens since there is lots of drinking and drug use. agent_1:True, and there are several love scenes to be aware of. But it talks about mental health as well, which is important	agent_2:Families can discuss big issues afterwards and it is good that the movie shows people standing up for what they believe in
11640	agent_2:I wonder what industries that would effect besides inflating balloons? agent_1:I'n not sure. lol  Do you know much about Mars? agent_2:I know it was named after the Roman God of War and I followed the Rover we recently had up there.	agent_1:I actually just looked yesterday at the last panorama view they put together.  If you fly to Mars under constant 1g accelaration it will only take 2 or 3 days.
164913	agent_1:Hello there, do you watch much television? agent_2:I love tv. How about you. Whats your favorite show. agent_1:Yeah same here, I love tv. I would have to say either Seinfeld or the Simpsons are my all time favs, how about you?	agent_2:Never cared for seinfeld myself. I love the simpsons. Did you know there is only one episode where bart isnt in the show or mentioned.
82056	"agent_1:Wow,  no I dont know her.  That is a nice paycheck,  what is her channel about? agent_2:Girl stuff. Speaking about celebrities. Paris Hilton was in the 2007 Guinness book of world records for ""most overrated celebrity"". agent_1:lol thats kinda weird,  I didnt know the guiness book tracks that kind of stuff . "	agent_2:Yes, right, I know. Thank you for chatting. have a nice day.
133820	agent_1:Yes. But we can use it for any climate condition. But it is not good for jogging purpose.  Shoes making become commercialized in 18th century. agent_2:Commercialization must have changed how shoes are made a lot. Shoes that are 5000 years old performed better than modern commercial shoes do! agent_1:In 19th century started as handicraft and then moved to large warehouse with machanized with production occur in large factories.	agent_2:That is probably where most of the shoes I buy are made. I can't afford the high fashion ones that are so complex to construct they are made individually by hand. Designer shoes like that are nice to look at, though.
65638	agent_2:No I didn't!  That's impressive though because all of those shows are really exceptional. agent_1:You're right they were all good. 3rd Rock from the Sun was really weird and different from the other three though I think, dealing with aliens and all that agent_2:Yeah, it was kind of breath of fresh air by being so different.  I liked that it had John Lithgow in it. Up until then I had always seen him as so serious. 	agent_1:I think that's the first thing I'd ever seen him in so I always expect him to be ridiculous in everything now haha. I used to really like Whose Line Is It Anyway too, did you ever watch that one?
94136	agent_2:now THAT sounds boring to me agent_1:If you were bored of your chicken, you could eat it.  agent_2:well i guess thats a big upseide to it haha. Did you know the original NES could only show 52 colors?	agent_1:I though it was 54, but I am really impressed what they could do with only 54 colors. maybe that is why they still sold it in 2003.
136615	agent_2:Me too! I think it would force them to work across party lines.  agent_1:Yes... definitely.... i am sick of the dividing... it's dividing the country! agent_2:It is terrible. I hope that we can start working together for a better future for our country before it is too late. 	agent_1:ME too!!! Great chat, have a great one!
31365	agent_2:I have watched those. They're so awesome! I love James Cameron who is the director. What do you think? agent_1:Yeah he does a really great job,  with all his movies.  Schwarzenegger only has 18 lines in the whole movie,  less than 100 words lol  agent_2:That's amazing! And he made it such an iconic role, so crazy that he only made $75,000 for his role in the first movie, but then made 15 million just seven years later for the second one haha	agent_1:Thats is a lot,  and Im sure he gets royalties too!
31435	agent_2:I would guess because Bambis mother gets shot. Dude would be scared to death all the time in my family. agent_1:I remember see it when I was a kid.  I found it sad more than horrifying  . agent_2:Yeah I never thought it was scary at all. I remember watching a movie called grandmas House when I was little. I had nightmares of it for a long time. Hated horror movies ever sense.	agent_1:Never heard of that one.I think my kids play some computer game called Grandmas House.  What's your opinion on celebrities?  I don't understand how people get so excited about someone just because they are on television.
20676	agent_1:Hi, how are you? agent_2:Not bad. Are you a fan of superhero movies? agent_1:I am. What about you? What's your favorite?	agent_2:I love wonder woman. I think they did an amazing job portraying her. Have you seen it?
157547	agent_2:Hillary Clinton was a republican in college, apparently...that's interesting.  agent_1:I did not know that.  Though she might be like me and grow more liberal as she ages.  Plus the Republican party has grown far more right-wing even since Reagan. agent_2:Yeah, the GOP is hard to relate to at times.  I try to be objective but its hard to even consider voting for a party that denies climate change and has people like Mike Pence that believe in conversion therapy.  	agent_1:I completely agree.  After the Civil Rights act and the Voting Rights Act they started shifting right and very conservative.  Taking away voting rights seems to be their big thing right now.
65083	agent_1:I think there is one now, but it just uses the name! I wonder if they have the movie Starship Troopers? agent_2:I thought that was a good movie so yeah thats a possibility, do you like science fiction? agent_1:I do! I didn't realize the term robotics was coined in 1941! Do you?	agent_2:I didnt either, Nasa has a list of space tech terms maybe thats in there
122618	agent_1:It's ok. Telephone is communication device and transmitted through cable. Through the same cable we are using internet. agent_2:It is amazing how just a cable not even 3 inches in diameter allows for all these benefits agent_1:There are optic fibre cable which is used in the ocean floor make more comfortable for accessing the phone.	agent_2:It is amazing how much technology for phones have come. A single iphone has more computing power than the entire nuclear icbm deterrent of the US.
141928	agent_1:I suppose it would have to do with the time value of money, like inflation over 2+ centuries.  Have you ever had an opportunity to take the White House tour? agent_2:I did but it was a long time ago. Apparently the guest house is bigger than the White House itself, do you think that is true agent_1:I too toured it, a long time ago before 9/11.  So, I suspect the tour has changed for security reasons.  About the guest house, I could easily see it being bigger.  After all, visiting dignitaries have to also be able to house their staff and security personnel during the visit.  While Secret Service protects the President while he is in the White House, the do not have to live with him. 	agent_2:Yep that makes sense. Do you think we should go back to our old rules for vice-presidents? You know the one that until 1805 said that the vice president would be the runner-up in the presidential election?
101939	agent_1:I like older cars, starting with the Model T in 1908. agent_2:Yea older cars are pretty cool. I'm more into trucks now. agent_1:OK.    I wonder if you can put a flamethrower on a truck in South Africa.    That is legal for cars.	agent_2:HAHA I have no idea, but that's funny! I didn't know the trunk of a car got its name because older cars actually had wooden trunks.
133474	agent_1:I don't listen to him, do you? If it's in the library of Congress I would assume its very good. But I wonder who is making these decisions? Like are they rap enthusiasts? doesn't their personal taste color what kinds of albums they would choose? agent_2:No I don't listen to him either. I have no idea who makes these selections, who ever is is probably getting paid way to much lol. agent_1:lol yes I would agree with that, also the judge who gave her ruling in the form of a rap when doing a suit against eminem was probably paid too much and had too much time on her hands lol	agent_2:I agree. I'm pretty sure there are more pressing issues going on in Michigan that needs more attention and thought but instead a judge takes the time to rap a ruling.
21352	agent_2:They went to Stanford. agent_1:Yes I truly believe the changed the world and the way we currently have knowldge always at our finger tips agent_2:made the life easier for everyone 	agent_1:They started a revolution
71576	agent_1:Who is Abba? How much money did he turn down and for what type of work? agent_2:They are a classic band from 70s. They turned down $1 Billion agent_1:that is a lot of money to turn down! Wonder if there are any regrets! How come they turned it down?	agent_2:Probably too hard on their bodies at this stage and maybe too many conditions for the money. I think Deep Purple holds records that they don't think they can break
97894	agent_2:For real! Were there any other topics you found interesting from your reading? I had a random factual section about Taylor Swift- apparently at one point she accidentally released a few seconds of white noise and it topped iTunes charts in Canada. Did you hear about that? agent_1:I read about it, makes you wonder if she did it on purpose for publicity. did you know the top three wealthiest presidents in american history were jfk, washington, and jefferson agent_2:Yeah I wouldn't be surprised. My article said that too! I figured JFK would be one of the wealthiest, but I didn't know about Washington and Jefferson. Mine also said that the President's guest house is bigger than the White House- I wonder what it looks like	agent_1:Pomp & circumstance. The first president of Zimbabwe was called banana.
118701	agent_1:Hey there. Are you a fan of rap music? agent_2:Hey, I am a little.  I used to listen to it a lot.  Rap has come a long way from DJ Hollywood delivering rhymes.  Do you like rap? agent_1:I do. It seems like it's been influential to all sorts of different styles of music, so it's hard not to be a fan.	agent_2:Yes, I agree.  Nice to see it getting recognition too like Tupac's music being in the Library of Congress.
125645	agent_1:Yeah that's a lot and apparently they give blood. Google prefers dogs to cats. I have to say i do too, lol! How about you? agent_2:I gotta take google's side on this although cats are pretty cool too agent_1:Yeah did you know that if a cat reaches 15 years old he would have slept for 10 of them? 	agent_2:That's insane, I wonder if Cats have 12 blood types like dogs do
106721	agent_2:That must have been so satisfying. It was Canada that scored 132 goals and only let in 3 at the first Olympic Winter Games in 1924. agent_1:I watch all my hockey on the TV. Have you been to any live games? agent_2:I have been to quite a few games. I know that there is a basketball court over the hockey rink.	agent_1:Better than making it into a pool table or something...  Yeah, my hockey is confined to a recliner. Much like when South Park aired it's Family Guy finale. I considered sending flowers to the producers, but .the Simpsons crew beat me to it!
155838	agent_1:That's cool.. Philadelphia Phillies is mine agent_2:Cool! There are a lot of great teams in the NFL. Sometimes it is tough to choose lol. agent_1:That's true!  32 teams all together!	agent_2:Right! And it's crazy that during a game there is actually only 11 minutes of live game play!
162205	agent_2:Well, if the government keeps shutting down, there won't be much left to know. What happens if you renounce your citizenship and there's not government to leave behind? agent_1:that is an interesting question. did you know trump is not the wealthiest us president? agent_2:He's so full of debt that he may be the poorest. He has not motive for moving to Monaco. 	agent_1:Yeah I guess you never know. Nice chatting with you
40086	agent_1:I do not know much about them. i would tend to avoid them, but i think they might be better than i think. agent_2:They are not bad. I dove off the coast of FL once and swam with a sschool of nurse sharks. agent_1:What is a nurse shark? do they help people, the way dolphins do?	agent_2:HA! I would not try to put a beef scented leg near their mouth. They are a smaller shark. I would probably have a heart attack if it would have been a great white...
135136	agent_2:Yes that is true. Do you know a guy became a professional car racer after beating 90 000 people in the video game gran turismo agent_1:I did not! That's certainly a good way to get inspiration. McDonald's actually was inspired by soldiers not being able to get out of their cars while in uniform, to create Drive-thrus! agent_2:That is so much consideration right there. do you use your phone much?	agent_1:I do! But I try to limit sometimes, because I've heard Unicef donates for every minute people don't use their cell phone.
8840	"agent_1:I haven't paid attention to that. I'll have to now. Cinematographer roger deakins has been nominated 13 times for the best cinematography oscar, and has never won. agent_2:He was good but not enough, did he do any comedies ? I like those kind of film.  agent_1:I don't think he did. Do you like Bill murray? Bill murray thinks kung fu hustle is ""the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy""."	agent_2:I like Bill Murray, Chinese comedies can be really funny. But I never saw kung fu hustle. Did you ?
49350	agent_2:I know right, its a popular franchise, I hope a 3rd movie is released, they should keep going,  agent_1:I know right! Sarah Vowell is the voice of Violet, shes my fav character! agent_2:Violet is a badass I agree, I must say my favorite charater lies between Mr. Incredible and Frozono, Frozono is as cool as ice is cold	agent_1:Yeah, she is,lol. Comedy in general is my favorite type of movie.
27038	agent_2:Dark side of the moon is still  top selling after 40 years! agent_1:I can believe that it was best selling album of 2014, right?  agent_2:I am not sure how albums will continue to be a thing. I hope you have a nice day!	agent_1:Well if the white house can keep using floppy disk they have a chance. You too, nice chatting.
130415	agent_2:oh that's good to know I wasn't aware. No I think that people will copy off of it like the police officers have Blutube there will be other knock off youtubes but nothing quite the same to replace it all together agent_1:Yeah, but people once viewed Netflix as a Blockbuster knock-off. Now, there is no Blockbuster. Netflix and YouTube account for half of all internet traffic in North America now. agent_2:That's true! Youtube has been evolving though which is a good thing Youtube Premium offers ad free access and exclusive content	agent_1:I use AdBlock. Haven't seen an ad in years. Do you like classic radio dramas? You can go to archive.org and listen to thousands of classic radio dramas for free.
160455	agent_1:I am the opposite.  I do not like Summer.  A cool fact is that you could meet the needs of the entire planet for 500,000 years with just one second of the Sun's energy. agent_2:Do you know what color the Sun is? It looks yellow to me but its hard to tell when I look up at the SUn agent_1:Yes, as I mentioned before, it is acutally white.  It just looks yellow to us due to atmospheric scattering.	agent_2:Oh I am sorry I forgot you mentioned that. I know the Sun is nearly 1.5 million kilometers away from Earth. That is a long trip
40520	agent_2:Bruce Lee, the Kung Fu star, was a dancer too, so Tupac is in good company as a double threat. What ever happened to Tupac? agent_1:Interesting, I like bruce Lee, good actor.  agent_2:Yeah, aparently he even won a Cha Cha contest once. Good on his feet and good with his feet!	agent_1:Interesting. He was a great karate actor too.
80422	agent_2:ahhh... those were good times...  was MJ still playing? agent_1:Yep. I remember the height of Jordan. Nike, Wheaties, Space Jam. agent_2:Space Jam. I loved Space Jam. I remember it earned a lot of money !	agent_1:It really hit a lot of pop culture on the nose with Looney Tunes and all the NBA stars
51965	"agent_2:I like some of her songs.  Are you a fan? agent_1:Somewhat.  I liked her earlier songs.  She removed her music from Spotify because she said ""music should not be free"" agent_2:I heard about that.  I think she was right. "	agent_1:Taylor Swift once accidentally released 8 seconds of white noise and topped the Canadian itunes charts. lol
156403	agent_1:I can't imagine ever doing that, could you? These people who are building radios and computers from stuff just lying around truly amaze me agent_2:No I could never! Yes they are so smart with tech! The space shuttles general purpose computer only runs on 1mb of Ram!  agent_1:How is that even possible? That seems like so little! I wonder if there are so many computers involved on board and at ground control that they don't need to be that powerful	agent_2:Yeah I don't understand it all in its entirety to be honest! Just as long as the president knows what's going on! The top 3 wealthiest presidents have been JFK, Washington, and Jefferson!
140597	agent_1:I heard it is because of atmospheric scattering, pretty crazy stuff huh?  agent_2:Wow. I have no idea what that even is. A lightning bolt is hotter than the sun? That seems illogical... agent_1:WOW! I didn't know that, how is that possible? 	agent_2:I know. I get burned by the sun all the time and people live after getting hit by lightning.
43305	agent_2:Really? I'm not familiar with that type of poetry, it really sounds interesting though, are there any famous ones that use that? agent_1:I do not know a specific one. have you ever heard the javanese alphabet? agent_2:I've never heard of that, I'm only familiar with the American alphabet, I imagine it to be quite different? 	agent_1:yeah, apparently when recited in order, it forms a poem. how beautiful is that?
32403	agent_2:Do you have any favorite superheroes? agent_1:I like the flash but I think my love of the TV has influenced that. Yours? agent_2:I was all-in with Flash for season 1 and 2, but haven't watched the more recent seasons.  Believe it or not, but Shazam was always a favorite and Firestorm.	agent_1:Nice. Was Shazam a TV show, ever?
92641	agent_2:Yeah I think that since that is the best way to play, they should use it even if it does look stupid, did you hear the story behind Air Jordans? agent_1:No I didnt what about the Air Jordans? agent_2:ya apparently they were banned initially, but Nike just kept paying the fine so Michael could keep wearing them	agent_1:I see, I guess Nike has the financial power to do that and more, I used to own a pair, they were really comfortable.
123962	agent_1:I love Netflix. I use it all of the time.  agent_2:it's amazing that they have 137 million subscribers world wide! And probably double that amount is watching from someones account lol. agent_1:That's probably true. I always had my own if for no other reason than my queue is huge and it would get annoying. Can you believe that they didn't even start their streaming service until 2007?	agent_2:Back in the day when you had to wait to get the DVD in the mail and hope it wasn't scratched. I barely watch the tele but am old enough to have seen the first episode of the Simpsons.
98518	agent_1:That's cool. Did you know McDonald's added a drive through to accomaaccom soldiers who couldn't get out of their cars in uniform agent_2:No, I did not know that! Jann mardenborough became a professional race car driver by beating 90,000 people in the video game gran turismo. And his parents probably told him those video games would lead no where! agent_1:And now look where he is. Odd fact it's legal to add flame thrower to your car to prevent car jacking.	agent_2:Huh!! I guess I gotta scrap those plans. I was intrigued, especialy with yesterday's news, about Facebook
84994	agent_1:Wow! That's insane. I would get so many books read. Do you have a Facebook account? agent_2:Believe it or not I don't. I had one for a couple years but, I hated all the advertising. agent_1:I have one but the toxic environment has begun to get to me and I am on it less and less. Did you know that MySpace turned down an offer to buy Facebook for $75 million in 2005? That was a huge mistake. 	agent_2:No, I bet they regret that. Do you know why it's mostly blue?
37166	agent_2:I use it sometimes. Did you know it appeared in one third of divorce papers in 2011? agent_1:Wow that is a lot. DO you know why it is blue?	agent_2:Hmm maybe because it is an appealing color
82688	agent_2:I have read that as well, very interesting, that would have been pretty cool to be at that courthouse to hear it.  agent_1:Did you know that the us supreme court building also as a basketball court on the top floor dubbed the highest court in the land? agent_2:Yeah I think I have heard that before, I wonder if there are money bets placed on some of those games!	agent_1:Who knows? But speaking of money, did you know the best paid state employees in most states are college football or basketball coaches?
80622	agent_2:I really think that's logical, although hard to enforce.  It probably wouldn't be at all hard to show the damage though. agent_1:I don't know, they might have sensors or something. An iphone has more computing power than the US nclear icbm deterrent agent_2:Oh wow, that's actually scary, you know?	agent_1:Yea,technology is getting too scary
82279	agent_2:I believe it was Atari. agent_1:i didnt get to play much with the eary atari, outdated by my time since the NES was king  agent_2:Well, it has been a nice exchange of information. Thank You.	agent_1:you to man, thank you for the time
12457	"agent_2:What I did not know is that Nokie played country with the likes of Buck Owens before starting the Ventures.  I wonder if ever played on Buck Owens TV show ""Hee Haw""? agent_1:I'm not sure, that show is a little bit before my time. I don't think I've ever seen it. agent_2:It is an old show...  You mentioned rock was your favorite genre.  What is your favorite rock album?"	agent_1:I have lately been listening to more greatest hits albums to listen to some classic acts. Right now I am listening to a lot of Queen, David Bowie, and the Dire Straits.
1257	agent_1:I can see him but Tupac?  I guess Tupac danced ballet in high school.  How can you hide a gun in tights?  agent_2:That sounds so crazy it might even be an urban legend! Ballet dancers go through a lot of shoes in just one week. Think how their feet feel! agent_1:Ouch!  I guess we are all dancers to some degree.  Babies naturally dance when they hear music.	agent_2:I remember as kids we'd have birthday parties and dance to various Disney Soundtracks. Do they still make those, I wonder?
100917	"agent_2:I did hear about that, thats pretty cool.   agent_1:I've never seen Justin Bieber's ""baby"" video, but I'm not a fan of his so I'm not really surprised that his is the most disliked video on YouTube. agent_2:I have seen it a long time ago,  I wasnt impressed,  but I cant believe its the most disliked video on Youtube lol "	agent_1:I feel like Bieber is always surrounded by drama. Maybe he should learn from Jim Carrey and not do anything with drama anymore since it doesn't prevent positivity.
16596	agent_1:yea that's a lot! agent_2:They're pretty smart too. They monitor illegal downloads to get a feel for what shows to stream. agent_1:Yep I've heard that they do that too. 	"agent_2:I'd like them to adapt some Isaac Asimov. He invented the word ""robotics"" actually."
54077	agent_1:Every day! There is even internet capabilities on Mt. Everest!  agent_2:Me too! Even astronauts have connection in the intl space station! agent_1:Very cool. Makes sense because it is so addicting with measurable changes in the brain! Well it was lovely chatting with you!	agent_2:Yes I have enjoyed very much!!
33542	agent_1:Hi, do you like lacrosse? agent_2:Hello I don't know anything about lacrosse. Maybe you can school me. agent_1:I am not sure I can! I am not too well versed in Maryland high school lacrosse. However, I do know baseball, tennis and football!	agent_2:Good. Would you like to talk about baseball?
151568	agent_2:Yeah... that is just so hard to believe quite honestly? agent_1:Me too. I wonder if we'll ever see a woman tryout for the NFL? agent_2:I really hope so... can definitely see a female kicker in the league!	agent_1:Me too! I'm going to go look into some more in the NFL. It was nice chatting with you have a good night!
137699	agent_1:Not usually. I use to have a boyfriend that loved the Patriots. He was from New Hampshire. I never understood how one team could represent 6 states and other teams could represent 1/3 of a state. agent_2:That's football, imagine how football on TV was before the invention of the yellow line for the first down. It must have been confusing.   agent_1:I was impressed when I first saw that on tv.	agent_2:I can even remember a game without it, it made the game much more interesting.
56154	agent_1:Yeah same here.  I think Google owns Youtube as well, did you know that? agent_2:Yeah, it seems like Google owns everything! agent_1:Yeah it sure does, and the amount of internet traffic they take up is just increasing I feel. 	agent_2:It does, thee is that one time it went down and took 40% of all web traffic with it
156543	agent_2:I want to play basket ball in the us supreme court building, its on the top floor and is known as the highest court in the land. agent_1:That would be cool, I wonder how many wagers there have been placed on those games! agent_2:It is crazy that the highest paid state employees are college basketball and football coaches in 39 out of the 50 states.	agent_1:That is crazy, I would never have guessed that.  There seem to be so many other jobs that would be paid more.
163876	agent_1:That is interesting.    I wonder if JFK was photographed more frequently since he is so wealthy. agent_2:Maybe. Did you know that John Wilkes booth was also in that picture? agent_1:Nope, did not know that.     Did you know the first president of Zimbabwe was called president Banana!	agent_2:Really that is kind of awesome!  Did you know the only US president to have a Ph. D. was Woodrow Wilson?
55180	agent_1:Yes, it is disgusting. So, do you like horror films? agent_2:Yes I do. My favorite was the exorcist but at the time the cast didn't know it was a horror film.  agent_1:Yes, I heard Danny, the boy from the Shining had no idea he was in a horror movie until years later, but I'm glad that was the case. That was scary!	agent_2:That's probably the best. What's the scariest movie you ever saw?
152724	agent_1:I've heard that but I don't believe it... there has to be more like that... agent_2:you would think so... but why would that be a fact then?  What's even crazier is that NO Saint cheerleaders have to leave a restaraunt if a NO Saint player comes in agent_1:? why is that ? They have to hang out together ? ;)	agent_2:I know right!  i guess they don't want them fratinizing!
161659	agent_1:That is odd, I wonder if President Banana or the pop singing Indonesian President have ever been in the guest house agent_2:Hahaha  They might have been there! agent_1:Speaking of music, did you know in WWII soldiers made radios from a razor blade and pencil?	agent_2:I didn't.  That is pretty cool and I wonder how they knew how to do that?
108623	agent_1:Nice. Did you know the white house got struck by bullets on november 11 agent_2:Yes and it took them 4 days to figure that out agent_1:That is long. DO you like Kim Kardashian?	agent_2:I do not follow her that much but I know she was friends with Paris Hilton
29101	"agent_2:Interesting.    That is the opposite of the Javanese Alphabet, which is simple but becomes a poem when recited in order. agent_1:Really? Did you know almost all of the hobbit characters names were taken from an old icelandic poem? agent_2:Interesting.     At least they didn't have to pay royalties.    Edgar Allan Poe only received $9 when ""The Raven"" was first published."	agent_1:Yea, I believe things like that were common practice when publishers stole the royalties from writers back in the day.
136282	agent_2:With all the video clips, tv show clips, music videos, documentaries, etc., its no wonder its no popular agent_1:To say nothing of the live streams and agreements with other media corporations.  It's no wonder it is the second largest search engine on the net. agent_2:So you don't like any dramas?	agent_1:I guess I like some, but it's not my favorite.  What about you?
145064	agent_2:yep! WOW... just saw that the US senate used the same gavel for 165 years! agent_1:It is odd that Nixon broke it.  He was not a senator.  Why did he have it? agent_2:Because he's nixon... geez!  it wasn't until 1993 woman were allowed to wear pants on the senate floor!	agent_1:I just remembered, he was VP and the VP is president of the senate so he would have the gavel.  It is interesting how recent some women's rights are.
58331	agent_2:I know that the UK Prime Minister has a cat with the official title of Chief Mouser to the cabinet office agent_1:In japan the prime minister gives you a silver cup when you turn 100 agent_2:That's pretty cool, it be nice if the US gave gifts to their citizens turning 100 like Japan does	agent_1:Yeah I know right!  lol
104794	agent_2:Never saw the ramones.  Even with them touring almost nonstop for 20 years.  Yikes!! agent_1:Man, I hope they are still touring, make it 21 years so I can see one last show. They rock! agent_2:They played almost 115 a year.  That's alot.	agent_1:That is so much! Not as much as linkin park in 2001 at 324! Good chatting with you!
65611	agent_2:Yeah that would be hard. Did you know they first released them in the 40s? agent_1:Yes, they went through different stages through time. I was pretty happy to get cassettes but still miss my collection. I have all of my albums on my playlists though so happy about that! Best thing on earth is to have a great collection of music. It has been great chatting! agent_2:Man I haven't had cassettes in a very long time, all mine is MP3 these days.	agent_1:I remember cassettes were truly amazing lol....portable!
109782	agent_2:Since we really ever see them on tv i don't know. You know Trump with all his money doesn't even rank in the top three richest presidents.  agent_1:yeah that is strange but I guess we need to account for inflation. so who are the top three? agent_2:Washington, Jefferson & JFK of course the playboy! haha. 	agent_1:wow good for them
157367	agent_2:Yep I think I know who you're talking about. Are you talking about Baker Mayfield? He was really good at Halo 3 actually agent_1:Yup. He says he can beat anyone at the university at that game! agent_2:I used to play that game back in the day, I would have tried to beat him LOL, did you hear about how the circular huddle was invented by the way?	agent_1:By a deaf player right?
137383	agent_2:right you never could have predicted that! do you know what a neopet is? I guess they were popular in 2001 agent_1:I have no idea what they are. Do you? Should I google this? agent_2:haha I don't know, but in 2001 they were the 4th biggest website in the world and appeared higher in search engines than google itself	agent_1:Now I have to google it to figure out what they are. I will use the three horizontal lines, known as a hamburger...
140319	agent_2:I used to watch Pokemon religiously, I wonder if they ever caught them all agent_1:I dont think so there are a lot of Pokemons now, 150 seemed like a lot at the beggining agent_2:right, I think I saw there was like 750 episodes so I hope they did lol! It was so nice chatting with you!	agent_1:Yeah thats about it, its been 16 years of Pokemons, and its been great chatting with you thanks,
22161	agent_2:Oh wow that's interesting. I know that in our school you had to pass a swimming test as well. But we live in Michigan and are surrounded by lakes so maybe that's why haha agent_1:Maybe! I feel like that's a basic survival skill that everyone should possess. I knew a few people when I graduated who couldn't swim and I didn't understand how or why.  agent_2:Wow are you serious? I don't know why it's so hard for people to swim haha, did you hear about the way to swim where you bind your hands and legs, you end up swimming like a dolphin and that's apparently a thing that people do haha	agent_1:I can swim well, but if I did that, I'd probably drown. I used to swim on a swim team and having a good swimsuit was important. There's a swimsuit that was banned by the Olympics because 94% of all races in 2008 were won by people who wore it.
21280	agent_2:wow in 2013 google went down for a mere 5 minutes and took 40% of web traffic with it agent_1:Yeah, the world would come to a halt if the internet died. what could anyone do? nothing could get done. agent_2:can you imagine the pressure on google and its employees? to keep the world running! google maps calculates traffic by tracking how fast android devices are moving on the road. Im not sure if thats cool or an invasion of privacy	agent_1:I think that people are happy that others provide the info to make traffic better but do not want to get busted for speeding LOL
27525	agent_2:Yes especially when if you're not one of the elites, you need a longer career to make money. agent_1:True, most careers are very short. And injuries ruin them easy. I saw something about Zion getting picked 1-3 there was a difference of over 10 million by spots agent_2:I also read that if he dropped past the 16th pick in the draft that he has an 8 million dollar insurance policy.	agent_1:Very smart by him and his people. it was fun talking to you have a great day!
52583	agent_2:I think I will also enjoy the music, jazz -blues from a composer Terrence Howard! agent_1:I havent heard of Terrence Howard before but I bet he is a great composer, do you use the phone much these days? agent_2:All the time, I remember many years ago when rotaty phones were used, and there was only one phone in my house.	agent_1:I remember that! you know that New York has the area code 212 because of this phones
54431	agent_2:That's awful that so many are homeless at some point in their life. Thankfully, a few do manage to break that cycle. Oddly, the current library of Alexandria has a copy of the internet saved.  agent_1:That is good that a copy of the internet is saved.  The internet can be useful for homeless people.  Where ever they may be, the internet is an endless resource for them. agent_2:I agree. Plus, many places have outlets outdoors in public spaces. Now, they need to work on the internet, as it's insane that the peak of Everest has it, and I can't get it in my barn.	agent_1:It has made travel so much easier to.  There is a website where you can find people that will let you sleep on their couch as you travel.  The internet can be utilized to do amazing things by people with good will and creativity.
151189	agent_2:hello,  I dont watch much football anymore.  But I like the 49ers.  although,  they havent been good in awhile lol  agent_1:Same here! agent_2:did you know the nfl has no rule against female players, women can basically play football. 	agent_1:Let's think about this. In high school, coaches accepted girls to condition and play for the team.
108812	agent_1:Thats amazing, that is such a cool and interesting fact, I didnt know that but they do seem jelly and full with water, do you follow politics much? agent_2:I follow it from time to time. One thing I do know is that the last president to have a PhD was Woodrow Wilson. I think that we should change that and we should have more presidents with phds, what about you? agent_1:I agree we should require our presidents to have at least a masters degree, up until 1805 the runner up of an election would become the vice president	agent_2:Yeah that's really weird. Can you imagine President Trump and Vice President Clinton? Talk about a recipe for disaster, I'm glad that rule is gone
68830	agent_1:going back to money, being a coach is also a lucrative field.  I'm told in 39 of 50 states the top paid state employee is either a college football or basketball coach.  Again, makes me wish I had a head for sports strategy.   agent_2:Wow, the highest paid state employee? I guess they do pretty good, I wonder why coaches dont ask players to shoot granny style more often, its the best shooting technique agent_1:Ahhh.. probably because the player wouldn't do it.  Best or not, it looks a bit on the silly side.  Doesn't have they coolness factor of the standard jump shot.  :)  	agent_2:I see your point it does look like a silly thing to do, do you like Tim Duncan, he is also another great player.
146206	agent_1:It didnt sound like the Russian foreign ministry is full of surprises,  agent_2:Oh Russians, always having fun.  Not like in the US where a cat named Hank was running in the Virginia Senate Election.  He got third. agent_1:Thats too bad I was cheering for Hank, probably would have done a better job than most politicians.	agent_2:The cat would have been cool!  It is a odd thing how how we pick elected officials.  Apparently the faster blinking person has lost every presidential election since 1980.
139688	"agent_2:That's a cool connection with McDonalds!   In regards to the song, it's one of the later versus.  He says ""I like the whopper, f' the big mac."" LOL agent_1:Nice... I do like the whopper more than the Big Mac. Although I do not go to either often.  The car brand cadillac was named after french explorer antoine de la mothe cadillac who founded detroit. agent_2:I wonder if he had an ""aggressive"" mode like Google's self-driving cars apparently do?  "	agent_1:I hope so! At least he doesn't have a flame-thrower in his cars like they do in south africa!
43613	agent_1:Yes. Do you know who invented the sport? agent_2:That was James Naismith. a coach at U of Kansas agent_1:Yes and the only losing coach in their history	agent_2:Yeah ironic. THe coaches are the highest paid employees in many states nowadays
58102	agent_1:That is so cool. Yeah I wonder too because they were 100 years old when it was released agent_2:interesting, and yes this deaf rapper's name is signmark, do you thinkwhen he performs there is a translater for hearing people? haha agent_1:Wow, talk about different. Do you know bhusta rhymes?	agent_2:I know of him but haven't listened to his songs, do you have any recommendations?
42024	agent_2:I hope so.  I grew up in California and have always followed them. agent_1:Yes!  Did you know that both LeBron James and Steph Curry were both born in Akron, Ohio?  It's been fun chatting! agent_2:That's cool.  I wonder if they knew each other around town?  Lol It's been nice chatting with you, too.  Enjoy the rest of your day.	agent_1:You have a great day too!
163748	agent_1:Seriously!  Apparently north korea is undergoing renovations of their theme parks under his orders.....priorities lol  agent_2:That is if the theme parks even exist at all! since they don't let anyone in to see we will never know. agent_1:Ah thats true,  it could be all lies!  North Korea is a country I don't prefer to visit	agent_2:Yeah, well it was nice chatting with you, have a good night.
38261	agent_2:I like the idea that they are bringing people on as full-time resident educators, and rotating new residents every 2 years.  It should make for a nice educational opportunity for aspiring theater people. agent_1:Yes, and they have funding now for 30 new works. agent_2:It's nice to hear something that is not technology based still making an impact.  I see that the renovation accomodate multiple stage and crowd configurations for audiences ranging 285 to 400 people.  I wish I was in the UK to get a chance to see it once renovated.	agent_1:Me too. Charcoalblue has done several things here in the US too, like Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater and Brooklyn's St. Ann's Warehouse.
27184	agent_2:Probably felt pretty silly! Caesar noted after visiting Britian that it's people used chickens for entertainment. I wonder what they were doing with them. agent_1:Probably fighting unfortunately. Doesn't sound very fun. What is fun is my old NES. I recently busted it out and the thing still works! agent_2:That's crazy! It can only display 57 colors. Seemed so high tech back in the day!	"agent_1:I think it's actually 54 colors. 8 bits of power. I still remember ""the code"" for contra!"
60061	agent_2:I think having something run that long would be a neat accomplishment, something that you create to exist long past your time.   agent_1:I never thought about it like that.  You are right.  His employees are taken care of apparently too.  The warehouse workers get a good exercise every day. They work between 7 and 15 miles during their shift. agent_2:That is a crazy amount, those warehouses must be pretty big, a lot bigger than when the first items were sold for sure.  The first thing sold was 27.95 and the customer got a building named after him.	agent_1:I wonder if he bought a book.  I heard that Amazon started out as an online bookstore.
29343	agent_1:Exactly! Why can't we be more like norway? Their government actively supports authors and buys their books to give to libraries. That is how a country should be.  agent_2:yes, but norway is socialist. they have high taxes and well developed social programs. universities are cheap or free. they love learning and reading. agent_1:Shame that people don't see the value of of the written word or education like that in the US. I do love the californian library of things though. That is a good movement to spread across the us	agent_2:yes, people that needs tools or equipment for short periods yet cant afford it can finally get some help. reduce reuse recycle. this is a good program.
108788	agent_1:He was? that sure is interesting, getting photographed with your killer, I mean what are the odds of that agent_2:I mean that is so wrong and creepy, isn't it?! agent_1:It is creepy, I agree, just like how a president released 3 pop albums while in office, 	agent_2:That is crazy! Was that a President in the US?
30197	agent_2:I did know that.  He was born in Akron, Ohio.  My home state so that's one reason I follow him.  His dad played for the Cavs when I was a kid. agent_1:That's great. Same hometown as Lebron, of course. Both fabulous players, but with very different styles of play. Lebron is BRAWN, and Steph is more STEALTH. Would you agree? agent_2:Definately.  ...and I think LeBron is on the downside of his career as well whereas Steph is on the upside.	agent_1:I agree, but I wonder about the play-offs this year. Houston Rockets are set to knock out the Warriors, or so some say. What do you think?
53583	agent_1:Yes, same here, only watched the recap of the recent State of Union address. As advanced as technology is these days, the White House still uses floppy disks for storing files! Possible security breach perhaps? agent_2:That is so hilarious, I don't even think you can buy those at a regular store anymore! agent_1:Yeah, Amazon probably doesn't even carry them anymore! There was one president who got with times and that's George W. Bush who had solar panels installed on the back of the white house.	agent_2:I had read that before, I also heard there were other presidents who took them down, and then put them back up.
64574	agent_2:You never know. Maybe he got paid really well until they found out how good his coaching was. agent_1:I'll have to look more up about him, or perhaps find a good book about him. I like to read sometimes. agent_2:I'm an avid reader. I haven't read many sports books, but I love fantasy and sci-fi works. Starship Troopers is next on my list to read.	agent_1:Nice! It's also on the reading lists of three of the five us military branches.
51788	agent_1:so do you know some of these fun facts that are listed? Like that some stars are cold to the human touch? agent_2:Yes, I knew that one.  Although, it would be impossible to actually touch given the gravity of the star. agent_1:that's true. since you know a bit more than I, what other facts can you share about the universe?	agent_2:I know that even though technology continues to increase, it will never be possible to see further than 1/2 way across the universe due to expansion
22891	agent_1:I did not know that. I definitely would not take advantage of that website lol. agent_2:I agree I wouldn't either! There are people who do strange things, when traveling, like stealing gnomes! agent_1:LOL that's pretty funny! Iceland has no public rail system so most people just travel by air in the country.	agent_2:that is cool!Did you know that back in the age of discovery, people is ships released rabbits in the islands? Do you know why?
53286	"agent_1:Super cool! I wonder if the aluminum affected the sound in any way - I imagine it would sound somewhat tinnier. ""Only"" 356 pounds?! Didn't know that was on the lower range of piano scales! agent_2:Yes, I feel like the aluminum piano would have an echo. Pianos are very heavy! 356 lbs. doesn't sound so bad. 5 men had to carry my sister's piano. It must have been heavier! agent_1:Wow, I just read that Pink Floyd recorded a live concert with no audience. The ticket prices for that today would be insane!"	agent_2:That's so heartbreaking knowing that they went through that. Looks like the Romans were not fans of Pink Floyd! I just read that a concert is a live music performance in front of an audience. So, was it really a concert with no audience? Hm.
82372	agent_1:Did you  know that the Nintendo entertainment system could only display 54 colors? agent_2:Only 54 colors? I guess that system was primitive, it got discontinued back in 2003 agent_1:Yeah. Anyways, nice chat! It was nice chatting with you!	agent_2:Im going to watch TV right now, thanks for the chat also, have a nice night.
81895	agent_2:Yeah. I find them to be brilliant. Like NWA's straight outta compton which went platinum without major air play or a tour. agent_1:ya thats impressive, did you ever play the NES as a kid though? agent_2:Yeah, I loved playing it. Did you?	agent_1:I did, crazy to think they only stopped making them back in 2003
40795	agent_1:yes, one site I use all the time is imdb, I had no idea that amazon bought then in 1998, I use that site almost every day agent_2:Amazon sure has their hands in all the cookie jars owning a publishing arm, film and tv studio, consumer electronic lines, AWS subsidiary, among other businesses. agent_1:Ya it is kind of scary with how much they own, also they do employ a lot of people but I don't know that the benefits are good, did you see all the news recently about how they had no breaks and had to urinate in bottles?	agent_2:I did not and I didn't know that working conditions were that extreme. I thought that Amazon touts work hard at pretty good pay and benefits, but I didn't know it was that bad.
77145	agent_2:No, not at all.  They scare me. agent_1:lol Yeah I guess mission accomplished on their part!  Did you know stephen kings first horror movie was Bambi?  (in his opinion Bambi was a horror film )lol agent_2:Really?  With the little cartoon deer?	agent_1:Yeah!  lol It was more sad than scary for me.
67060	"agent_1:Yes.  Of course that is fantasy of a different type. agent_2:The third movie was the only fantasy film to win an Academy Award for ""Best Picture"" agent_1:I did not remember that.  Back to competitive fantasy.  There is also a game where people draft congress people and score on how many bills they successfully vote for.  That seems so boring!"	agent_2:I'm sure political science students would find enjoyment in that. It could be a great teaching tool!
153124	"agent_2:I agree. I am pretty sure the ""i'll be waiting with my gun"" is a jokey threat that has been around for decades. agent_1:I think many could relate; I think some are too quick to chastise someone when they can agent_2:The NFL has been around a long time and has had to deal with a lot of controversies lately."	agent_1:The DV issues seem to be plaguing them the most
60708	agent_1:Yes, but didnt he get busted for cheating? does he often work in a gray area? agent_2:he certainly does, but even with that, it is hard to discount long term success agent_1:Yeah, you could not just cheat and win. you have to have something more. I guess Bill will be in the game many more years.	agent_2:he probably will be, and even though brady has been here for 20 years, he still likely will stick around for awhile longer
109082	"agent_1:Must have.  Do you think the Pats will remain strong beyond the Belichick+Brady duo?  I remember that the Cowboys were a powerhouse with Tom Landry coaching and Roger Starbauch at QB.  They have not been that strong since those days. agent_2:no i do not, too many brilliant coaches and better players, the game is evolving in my opinion agent_1:Well, Tom sure has a handsome paycheck.  What is interesting is while we have a good idea what the stars make, we know little about the ""average"" player earnings.  Did you know that the lifetime earnings of an engineer exceed that of an average NFL player.  I guess given the short time of football careers, they should be investing well for post-football income security!"	agent_2:I have heard that, engineers make decent money though, but they are never in the same kind of danger I suppose
34767	agent_2:I do.  My whole family has a great sense of humor.  It's gets us by some rough spots... agent_1:That is certainly true, if it werent for humor, I would have not likely survived the last year. agent_2:Bad year huh?  Sorry.  I guess she likes to do anti-men stuff.  I'm getting kind of tired of that... Oh well, I guess men give them plenty of ammo. 	agent_1:Yeah, had cancer.  It sucked but keeping in good spirits really helped me though.  I named the tumor Fat Bastard.  With each radiation treatment it was all about Kill Fat Bastard.
63805	agent_1:Yea if I remember correctly she plays the role of Talisa Maegyr agent_2:Yes. DId you know the name Arya is being given to lots of kids now? agent_1:Yes and in part is thanks to the name in GoT	agent_2:Yeah. Did you know they are financed by Ireland in part?
43016	agent_2:I wonder why that is and who built them.  I used to live in DC, we always looked forward to see the tree go up around the White House. agent_1:I do not know actually and I wonder also who lives there. Well good you got a chance to see it now. Apparently Roosevlet banned them from the white house agent_2:Yeah, bit of a conservationist.  Just like the Norwegians, they donated a billion dollars to the amazon rain forest once.	agent_1:That is a  lot of money. On the other hand the US government has really shifted their focus towards protecting their employees from prosecution if they violate geneva conventions
110512	agent_1:Me too! Do you know why its called the trunk of your car? agent_2:Is it because they used to have a wooden trunk on the back and now its called a trunk. agent_1:Yes! i never knew that. 	agent_2:It is cool! Did you know the Mcdonalds drive thru has only been around since 1975?
105453	agent_2:Homer has held 188 in 400 episodes. Hes living the dream agent_1:What do you mean 188? agent_2:188 jobs sorry	agent_1:Oh gotcha. That's a lot!
5629	agent_2:They make most of their money off of ads agent_1:Yea they make a lot off of ads. I saw that Facebook is blue because Mark Zuckerburg is red-green blind. agent_2:Yeah, that is weird. I know how you can get a free whopper from BK	agent_1:How can you get a free whopper?
71424	agent_1:That's my blind spot. I guess I was thinking more about a nice vacation away from the hustle and bustle of the real world. How long do you think these balloons would last? agent_2:I cant imagine they would last more than a few weeks before they are blown away or deflate, even if they were up high  agent_1:I wonder how long weather balloons last... I think those are pretty durable, right? Why not just build a tower?	agent_2:I think the challenge of a tower is you have to go there and maintain it, as opposed to being able to just put something in the air
131910	"agent_2:That's surprising, a year after he won a helicopter was used to dry off the US Open's tennis court agent_1:That's funny and also a good idea. The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days.  agent_2:That's pretty intense. Gael Monfils was able to beat the ""roger federer of paddle tennis"" right after he learned how to play table tennis"	agent_1:Haha that's awesome. Do you know much about the presidents?
66856	agent_1:Yeah including simple special purposes devices like the microwave.  agent_2:Yes. I know I sure could not live without mine. Good chatting with you today! agent_1:I couldn't either! You too!	agent_2:Have a good night.
136273	"agent_1:I may check out clips on YouTube to see if it is for me.  Do you ever watch YouTube? agent_2:Yes i do. Did you know that ""baby"" by justin beiber is the most disliked video on youtube? agent_1:Interesting.  I wonder what has the most likes."	agent_2:Im not sure but it would be interesting to find out.
135830	agent_1:Do you watch tv shows? On tv or internet? agent_2:I only watch on TV.  I do stream some but I still put them on my smart TV rather than a computer.  I use the LED technology but if I had a smaller screen I would use OLED. agent_1:What do you enjoy watching on tv? It is interesting how the tv used to transmit images in monochrome but know can display in colour as well as several dimensions and with sounds.	agent_2:I enjoy Madam Secretary and Bluebloods.  I love the 4K pictures that digital transmission has allowed in recent years.  How about you?
146407	"agent_2:My kids certainly don't have a clue haha. They are extremely familiar with the ocean though, and I told them the comm cables are 2.7 inches in diameter and just lay on the bottom of the ocean floor. That got more of a reaction than anything. agent_1:That is interesting! I wonder what would happen if those lines got destroyed. agent_2:That would be incredibly disasterous for many people however, I would relish in having just a few days of silence :) I've started turning my cell phone off the moment I leave work and it's odd to hear people say, ""I tried to call you!"" only to hear it was over something that was trivial and is old news by the next morning. "	agent_1:I have my notifications off on my applications so I only check them when necessary. I figure if it's important, people will call.
141663	agent_1:i would like to listen to a few of those. i remember war of the worlds. that was a controversial broadcast. agent_2:Wonder if they have that one that is able to be listen to? According to Canadian law all radios are required to have at least 40% of the music play be Canadian. agent_1:the CanCon rule. put there to protect the local talent from outside competition. now every canadian know rush.	agent_2:And Justin Bieber and Drake LOL! There is even a Latin radio broadcast in Finland!
62365	agent_2:Oh i forgot about the PS4 i love it. What games do you play?  agent_1:Playstation has a lot of history and diverse consoles but I like the PSP agent_2:I have not played that one i think i'm old school but i know it's cool. It was originally launch back in December of 1994.	agent_1:Isn't PSP pretty old too? Now it has been PS Vita for a while
86609	agent_1:What do you think of Kareem abdul-jabbar? The dunk was banned in college basketball because of him! agent_2:It was banned? I think that sucks, the dunk shot is like the ultimate move of the game, seems like you are a fan of the game? agent_1:Absolutely! Not only was it banned, but it was for over a decade!	agent_2:Oh thats a relief, I dont watch college basketball that much but still, you know that Shaq has recorded only a 3 pointed sscore in his entire carreer.
100890	agent_1:The onion voted him the sexiest man alive, which was a complete joke, but China believed it! agent_2:Gross haha! He is the grandson of the first leader of North Korea. agent_1:Yea and a complete lunatic. He killed off most of his own family.	agent_2:That's sad. I wonder how long he will stay a leader.
64782	agent_1:Yes me too. DO you know who Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is? agent_2:Do I know who he is? Of course I do, he was the reason why the dunk was banned for a while in college! do you like him? agent_1:Yeah that is pretty amazing actually. Do you know who invented the sport?	agent_2:I think some guy from kansas did, James Naismith. Did you know basketball coaches are the highest paid state employees in 39 of the 50 states?
81401	agent_1:Thank you for the recommendations. The Stand was fantastic! I am not sure when Starship Troopers was written. Reading is a wonderful thing to do.  agent_2:You're going to LOVE it! I found out Robert Heinlein wrote Starship Troopers in 1959. He wrote The Puppet Master, which Invasion of the Body Snatchers was based on. agent_1:Sounds like I will . I thank you and it was great chatting with you about all these new facts.	agent_2:I know. You're the most fun I've had chatting, in the dozen times I've chatted today. King fans, unite!
34370	agent_2:that is so amazing, I would hire him for any movie made. He should have been in disney's treasure planet, that movie bombed at the box office agent_1:Or Trojan wars, I wonder how many people went to see it if it only made $309 dollars at the box office agent_2:right! Maybe 30 lol! I wonder how bad it really was and if it can be found anywhere to watch. Do you like comedy films?	"agent_1:Yea, I really liked Kung Fu Hustle, Bill Murray though it was a ""Supreme Achievement"" in comedy"
125496	agent_1:haha thats a good question, seems very unfair ,also weird is how the avg nfl game only has 11 mins of actual gameplay, the rest is commercials and reffing and stuff agent_2:Yeah, there are a lot of commercials, they even bothers me on youtube and there is only one. Do you watch Youtube ? agent_1:ya I do, I watch it everyday, you? I can't believe its the second largest search engine on the internet, thats impressive!	agent_2:Yeah, I really like watching specific and technical stuff like picking locks. What do you watch on Youtube ?
109245	agent_1:It's cool that Hybrid Theory is so popular. I loved Linkin Park -- they were one of the early 00s groups that were like holdovers from the grunge era. agent_2:I was a huge fan of Linkin Park too.  They have the highest selling album of the 21st century still I think.  Very sad what happened to their lead singer. agent_1:Yeah. I always hate when someone's creative potential is cut short. It makes me happy though that Dark Side of the Moon is still popular. Did you ever try that trick of syncing it up with The Wizard of Oz?	agent_2:I have not tried it, but I have heard it is a very cool experience.  Bob Marley is also still popular.  He's been on the carts for over 914 weeks!
131461	agent_1:But it was at a really cool venue, in Pompeii.  Probably booked it for recording purposes.   agent_2:Yeah, I'm sure it was neat. I went to a cool concert in Washington D.C once, not far from the White House. Their guest house is actually bigger than the White House, itself.  agent_1:I wonder where it is, I dont think I have ever seen photos of it or anything. 	agent_2:Me neither. I didn't realize that Dictators can also be called Presidents until recently.
56223	agent_2:Yeah. Did you see the original? agent_1:I did not. MJ was probably ok. lebron should be better. agent_2:I didn't see it either. I am interested to see how LeBron does. He really didn't have a good year this year, in basketball.	"agent_1:Shooting ""granny style"" is the absolute best technique to consistently score points on the line, maybe he should try that LOL"
95790	agent_2:Are you a car lover? I am surprised that McDonalds built drive thrus for service men that were not supposed to get out of their cars? agent_1:I am a car lover, and I think that was back in 1975 right? well its a great invention for sure agent_2:I did not know that trunks got their name because people carried trunks on the back of their trucks!	agent_1:I did not know that either just lilke how the Cadillac brand got its name.
117618	agent_2:Yes, it is, kind of an emasculating thing to do.  Make the other team feel all weak and girly! Lol agent_1:lol  In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as the top fooball stars back then.  Bet that's different now. agent_2:Yes, it's changed drastically.  Bowling is not even in the same ballpark, anymore!  Do you watch college of NFL football or both?	agent_1:I watch both.  How about you?
109002	agent_2:yea only a select few get that big paycheck. I bet these are the same engineers that make tracking chips that are in shoulder pads that track things agent_1:Yes, I read that. I can see why they track the bowl, but why do you think they track the players' equipment? Also, there's no rule against women playing in the league, I've seem some great women soccer players, you think there will ever be a female kicker? agent_2:I think there is a female kicker in the making. I just read an article the other day and it may happen sooner than later, that would be great i feel!	agent_1:On the flip side of that, did you see where the New Orleans Saints don't allow their cheerleaders to dine at the same restaurant as the players? If they eating when a player enters they have to leave the restaurant immediately? That seem sexist and has the making of a law suit to me.
48032	agent_2:Oh so Tesla was his best friend, so much talent between the two of them, I did know he was raised in Missouri agent_1:Yeah, go figure. do you know who filmed the only footage of Twaim? agent_2:I think it was Thomas Edison correct me if I'm mistaken, 	agent_1:Yes it was. That is so cool that at least he was able to do that
152687	agent_2:I guess Tom should do her job then! LOL. is she a model or something?  agent_1:Yes, she is! agent_2:That is a great job, if you can get one. Brady is not a young guy anymore, is he? Is he planning to retire?	agent_1:Eventually, he wants to play till hes like 45. He is on the injury report every week for no reason too
161541	agent_2:It's definitely sad. People and governments can often leave others without the best support. agent_1:They can be, but they can do really good things too! The Amazon can thank the Norwegian government for donating $1 billion to help save the rainforest agent_2:That's so neat! People in government can be super cool, I guess. Like the Indonesian president, who has recorded several pop albums during his time in office.	agent_1:There's also funny government stories. Like the guy who impersonated a French government official twice. He managed to sell the Eiffel Tower both times
141448	agent_1:Well, but time probably added to the value, no? I wonder if the grandson found a Honus Wagner. Isn't that the super valuable one? In the 90s I think Wayne Gretzky bought one as an investment.  agent_2:Honus Wagner was a card in a pack of cigs, I think. That goes way back. Why do baseball managers wear uniforms still? They're too old to play. agent_1:Well, but they can play in an emergency! It's in the rules. Back in the day, player-managers were more of a thing, they were younger. 	agent_2:Probably one of the players got chosen to be manager. Well, I enjoyed chatting!
47928	agent_2:Did you know that until 2005 a married couple scheduled all of the games for the season?	agent_1:No, that is awesome though!  I wonder how they ever got into that job in the first place?
24507	agent_1:I adore Dean Koontz. Dogs are my favorite things, they are fascinating creatures, and they can donate blood to other doggs. agent_2:Yes, and I've heard there are 12 different blood types dogs have and there are doggie blood drives! agent_1:Those are so cool, I would love to go to one. Google is a dog company, and you can bring your buddy to work with you.	agent_2:I didn't know they let you bring them to work.  That's cool.  You know, I can't remember one horror film aside from Cujo by Stephen King that had a bad dog in it.
117402	agent_1:Yeah. Blockbuster could have bought Netflix for $50 million and did not agent_2:That was not a smart decision. Nice chat	agent_1:Same here
96493	"agent_2:Have to check it out. My favorites would include Paul Simon, James Taylor - they may be old rock dudes, but their songs stay in my head, you know? agent_1:they wrote great songs, hits, memorable tunes and lyrics. i figure that their music will last forever. agent_2:Hope so. Past the sounds of silence. Did you know ""The Dark Side of the Moon"" - album released over 40 yrs. ago - is still a best-seller? Who released it, do you know?"	agent_1:Pink Floyd. i dont know what they are doing now. anyway, great chat!
157014	agent_2:The political winds change direction so rapidly some times. I wonder how Virginia will vote in the 2020. agent_1:Im sure probably not for Trump! agent_2:I have no idea what will happen. I think people underestimated Trump's popularity last time, so I won't do that this time. 	agent_1:Same here! I did not know the republican party was referred to as the grand old party!
98153	agent_2:Yeah that is a good question.  I definitely think it is time to have all of that re-written on how long they can serve.  agent_1:Of course until we get some new blood into the government in general things aren't likely to change.  agent_2:Yeah that is true as well.  It's like the chicken and the egg thing almost, like can't change if we don't get new blood, but the old blood controls it still. 	agent_1:Especially in the US the office of politicians seems to be limited to the super rich.
160060	agent_2:No I did not know that. But I do know about that hearse that carried Rosa Parks and Aretha Franklin. That thing was dope! agent_1:I did not know about that. Can you elaborate? agent_2:It was a white hearse from the 40's with a vintage slope to the back.	agent_1:And the exact same one carried both in their funeral processions?
68016	agent_2:Why doesnt he? he is a great actor, although I  see him more as a comedy actor agent_1:Yeah it didn't make much since to me either. but he says it goes against his belief system.  agent_2:I guess I can respect that, drama can really change your state of mind, I like comedy better, do you follow Shakespeare?	agent_1:Not since high school, lol. I hear he coined a bunch of phrases that we use today though.
91407	agent_2:That was a great system too! So many choices these days for entertainment it can be overwhelming. They even still show silent movies sometimes, what comedy!  agent_1:I love old Charles Chapplin movies, that was some good silent comedy, you know that Reagan was once  rejected for a role of President because they didnt though he had the presidential look, thats really ironic agent_2:Hahaha, really? That's funny! I find it interesting that the comedy tv show 3RD Rock From The Sun won a golden globe over Seinfeld...Friends and Frasier. Crazy! 	agent_1:3rd Rock from the Sun beat those other shows? I wonder if the jury got paid lol, the show isnt that good.
65155	agent_2:It certainly gained the attention it needed. I am surprised that two identical twins aged 100 put out a rap album in 1992. agent_1:I guess its never too late to follow your dream that must be a funny thing to watch though I wonder if they made a musical video of one of their songs.  agent_2:If they did it would be fun to see. I wonder if they'll get recognition like Tupac. His music is in the Library of Congress as having cultural significance.	agent_1:I guess Tupac is one of the greatest artists ever too bad he died at a young age and in the way he did.
148435	agent_2:I did not know that, that was smart. There was a former patriots player never fumbled the football in his career.  agent_1:A player that never fumbled the ball at all?  Who was this and what position did he play? agent_2:Running Back named Benjarvus green-ellis.	agent_1:That is impressive that a running back never fumbled the ball. He must be really good.  Does he still play?  I'm not familiar with his name.  What team is he on?
31582	agent_1:Buy Really Useful Box Office Compartment Tray 4 Litres from the Plastic Storage Boxes range at Hobbycraft.  agent_2:Ok.  Just finished checking social media.  I had no idea Myspace once had an opportunity to buy Facebook and turned it down. agent_1:Sorry, I don't know above that details.	agent_2:Yeah, Facebook is huge now but there is a backlash.  Burger King has a promotion that if you unfriend 10 people you get a free sandwich.
16686	"agent_2:the tool library is an awesome idea. many people dont have enough money for some basic tools. reduce, reuse recycle. it is a good system. agent_1:That is a great idea, actually. I wonder if they sell tools at the ""library of things""? Speaking of libraries, I think it's nice that if you publish a book in Norway, the government there buys 1000 copies and distributes them to libraries across their country. I wish every government would do that! agent_2:I will move to Norway. I will write childrens books and become rich. that is now my plan. Yes!"	agent_1:It's a great idea. We mentioned the library of things previously, but I wonder if they also rent out legos?   I love Legos! In fact, the German  Lego factory would give out a 14k gold Lego brick to employees who had worked there for 25 years back in the early 80s. I think that is awesome and it's too bad they still don't do that today!
113008	agent_2:I do. Only missed 1 election in my life. agent_1:It is cool that astronauts vote from space! agent_2:That is cool. I have thought baout the logistics of that and cant figure it out.	agent_1:It is also amazing that not all men in the UK had the vote until 1918.
136741	agent_2:Interesting, I might. I can believe that the russians did it.  agent_1:Someone built a computer using nothing but the basic minecraft building blocks. Not sure what that really means since I don't use Minecraft. agent_2:That's crazy, Ive never even played the game minecraft, have you? 	agent_1:No, I haven't. It seems kind of boring. Computers have progressed so much though. The space shuttle's general purpose computer runs on 1 mb of ram.
66845	agent_2:Wow! that's a lot of money. What a moneymaker compared to the movie Trojan Wars with a budget of 15 million and then it only made $309 in the box office. What a flop. agent_1:Right! what about Treasure Planet i think that was one of there big flops as well. What do you think of computers? agent_2:I have not heard of that one. I love computers! Did you know the space shuttles general purpose computer runs on 1 mb of RAM?	agent_1:Wow i don't know if thats being efficient or foolish. Did you know that the Russians created a computer that ran on water.
139046	"agent_2:I bet.  Kind of an odd show.  Were you a fan of That 70s show? agent_1:Yeah. I used to watch it all the time. agent_2:Did you know that they remade it in the UK calling it ""Days Like These"" but it was cancelled after only 10 episodes?"	agent_1:I guess it doesnt translate well. I think it is about life in the Us in the 70s anyways.
48512	agent_2:Yeah, that is pretty funny. Do you watch soccer?  agent_1:I usually watch the world cup. the game is at a high level. it is a lot of fun. You? agent_2:Yeah, we go out during the day games to have a drink and watch. 	agent_1:Yeah, that is the way to do it. I wish I could attend, but it is a bit expensive. The US women's team has done very well at the WC.
90052	agent_2:Sounds mysterious. Did you know the Celebrity status is often associated with wealth? agent_1:I didnt know that! Judge Judy would know all about that with her 123k per episode!  agent_2:Great for her! Carol Burnett was the first celebrity to appear on Sesame Street!	agent_1:I didnt know that! I liked robin williams as genie in Aladdin! i didnt know that started the trend though!
72359	"agent_1:Yes, that was funny. Did you see his mea culpa video? He was with like the prime minister doing a PSA.  agent_2:I wonder what all the meetings were leading up to their final ""truce"". I wonder what his next project is going to be. agent_1:I did not know he was doing a biopic on Dr Seuss. "	agent_2:Yeah, that was news to me.  Very curious to see how they blend the reality with the world of Seuss.  Or if it's going to be straight biography style.
134125	agent_1:Do you use the internet often? agent_2:I do, I use it everyday in fact, what about you? do you use it much? agent_1:I use it quite often as well. Are you familiar with how it works?	agent_2:Kind of, I know it gets by cable to my home and I have a router that distributes the wireless signal
156659	"agent_1:HA! That would be the most dysfunctional presidency in the history of the US; although he's doing a fine job of that without her... If he had a pop album, would you listen to it? agent_2:No, in total fairness I'm just not a big fan of his voice.  I wonder sometimes what exactly the role of our president is. I mean, presidents have different roles depending on the government and the country. agent_1:Yeah. I am not sure what this president's role is. I say that as someone who wants the president to succeed but this is really tough to root for, even before he was elected. The whole ""grab her by the..."" mad me angry as a father and husband. Grab either of my girls, regardless and there will be an issue."	agent_2:That was pretty rude. I want to see him succeed because I want our country and our lives to improve.  His role seems to change, sometimes he seems ceremonia, other times like a leader, and then sometimes like he would like to be a dictator.
144785	agent_2:Burger King does those promotions for all types of things, I think it is a great promotional technique. agent_1:Still makes you wonder why they targeted facebook. However, I think that facebook still has considerable power since iceland is using facebook to rewrite their constitution to gain access to public opinion. agent_2:I'm not sure why either, I found it curious. I think it is interesting that there is a lawyer in Switzerland who represents animals in court, I wonder if he advertises on Facebook?	agent_1:I wonder what such lawyers had to do to universally give animals constitutionally guaranteed legal rights in germany?
133149	agent_2:I think we should care about the world economy whether it's your own country or not. There are many factors that make this a global issue rather than just a Russian issue. agent_1:Good point. With globalization one economy can take a lot of economies down with it. agent_2:Each country brings a resource to the world stage and if one economy fails they'll need to account for it in some way. 	agent_1:Do you think what the President has done here spurred our economy, or just kind of kept it chugging along?
50381	agent_1:The NES was all about great game play. Sadly, it was discontinued in September of 2003 in Japan.  agent_2:Hard to believe that was that long ago.  I think they started making the Game Cube around then?  I like all kinds of entertainment...even watching comedies!  Are you a fan of comedies? agent_1:Yes, I enjoy comedies. The Green Lantern film was originally going to be a comedy starring Jack Black. I would like to have seen that version. It would probably be better than the actual one. Jack is a natural comedian. 	agent_2:I agree.  It would have made the movie totally different!   Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 shows since it was created in 1989.  Crazy number.
119326	agent_1:I don't know.  Please tell me.  I'm always interested in facts related to our presidents. agent_2:Well, that was Lincoln, he was the first president to be photographed for his inauguration and John Wilkes Booth was actually in that photo.  agent_1:Thank you for the interesting facts about our presidents.  I've got to run now.  It was nice chatting with you.	agent_2:You as well,
77691	agent_1:That's funny you think that they could just use fake grass LOL. How often do you travel though? Would you ever travel to Greenland? agent_2:I would love to go there. I like to travel but usually stay in hotels. Have you couch surfed before? agent_1:No I've never done that. What does that involve actually? I know I have used Airbnb before, but no I've never couch surfed	agent_2:There is a website like Airbnb where people will let you crash on their couch while you are traveling.
100006	agent_1:he sure does. Do you know reggie miller? agent_2:Yeah his an NBA hall of famer right? agent_1:yeah he is. as good as he is though , his sister was always better. she broke  eight national record once	agent_2:Really she did? wow, that is amazing, eight records is quite a feat.
113270	agent_1:Yeah, that is crazy. even crazier is that I've never once seen it. But I've played Pokemon Go.  agent_2:I haven't seen a Pokemon episode either. Maybe I can catch it on Netflix though? I mean between Netflix and YouTube, they account for half the peak internet traffic in north America so I'm sure they have some episodes of Pokemon. agent_1:Yeah, that is crazy, from 9-12 they account for 33%. 	agent_2:That and they actually spend 20 times more on postage than bandwidth. Can you believe that? Like, how is that possible? Ha!
50036	agent_1:Wow I didn't know that. I used to watch Comedy Central back in the day, but haven't seen it in awhile. agent_2:Me too.  I mainly only watch amazon prime and netflix now.  Only time I really watch live tv is for sports.  Did you ever see the Incredibles 2 movie? agent_1:I have not. Have you seen it?	agent_2:Not yet.  I did see the first one.  I can't believe it's been 15 years already since that one came out in 2004.
32167	agent_2:Yeah I agree not sure what the deal with that is. Football/soccer is a great sport though. It makes the most money out of any sport! agent_1:Yes I think it makes more money then every other sport combined! Even American football, which makes a ton of money here agent_2:Yeah very true. That's saying something. Jon Stewart, the tv guy, was a skilled soccer player. 	agent_1:Yes he played soccer back in 1983 I think. I wonder if he was really good, but yes he's most famous for The Daily Show TV show
60988	agent_2:i would love to visit the place and seen the tower that spawned the story. Teddy roosevelt and john quincy adams are the only two us presidents that did not use a bible at their swearing-in ceremonies. i guess they used a different document? agent_1:Yeah they must've not sure what they use though. They have also made a lot of movies based on religious fact. Tom Hanks is actually the highest all time box office star. agent_2:tom has got the touch! he works with very good people too. i figure that his name alone is worth a lot audience for any film	agent_1:Yeah definitely my favorite film of his was Forrest Gump. There have also been some box office flops like the movie Trojan wars. I have never even heard of it.
24249	agent_2:Yeah that is justified I guess. The Dutch are creating a bus that goes 160 mph agent_1:I would like to try that. In Iceland there is no railway so you have to travel by plane or a car agent_2:It is a rough terrain so I can see it being costly to build a railway there	agent_1:Exactly. How fun to take super short plane trips from town to town
110347	agent_2:Yea, he was once rejected for a film role because he didn't look too presidential  agent_1:yea, that is so crazy, times were different and he was different then also probably. Do you own a car? agent_2:Yea, it's pretty beat up though. I wish I could equip it with a flame thrower like you can in South Africa 	agent_1:mine too lol, I wish I could too. That would hopefully heat my car up faster in this cold cold winter, lol! I wonder why they allow that
136235	agent_1:I used to be a Justin Bieber fan. However, did you know that one of his songs had negative outlooks in the social media life. agent_2:I would kind of expect that he would have a very disliked video.  People seem to love or hate Justin Bieber.  It was started by three former PayPal employees in 2005: Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim.  I like how when Google acquired the company they added features like requiring users to state that they are 18 years old for certain videos.  Do you know of any other popular videos on the site? agent_1:Well, that is the social media life. Whoever is willing to post that video should get used to the comments. I believe that it is a good idea for Google to do that. This gives a relief for parents to not worry about it. I love Korean pop. This includes Psy's gangnam style, which had a big impact to Youtube's varieties.	agent_2:Did you know that Psy's gangnam style got so many views on youtube that they had to upgrade the view count integer to 64 bits?  I haven't watched that much Korean pop.
131832	agent_2:I never knew he was an athlete. Brazil is crazy about soccer.  A German soccer player donated his World Cup bonus to help sick kids. agent_1:Yes he was. As you said, anybody can play soccer. Wow, what a sympathetic guy. How much was it? agent_2:Over $300,000. What a guy! Do you follow American football?	agent_1:Wow! that is a big number! He should be in the Hall-of-Fame. I am a 49ers fan. I do not follow as much. What is you favorite team?
94153	"agent_2:that's a funny term for it. In England, they call the trunk the ""boot."" I don't think they had a boot at the back of the car.  agent_1:Thats true. Their language is a bit different. American language is so frank.t is legal in south-africa to equip your car with flame-throwers to prevent carjacking. agent_2:If I lived in South Africa, I would equip my car with flame-throwers."	agent_1:me too! Jann mardenborough became a professional race car driver by beating 90,000 people in the video game gran turismo.
35871	agent_1:ah you're right, ya the movie hairspray, they made a movie with john travolta of that play and he plays a woman, I just don't know how that works haha agent_2:I haven't seen that one... Not too interested in it. Did you see Mrs Doubtfire with Robin Williams dressed up as a grandma? agent_1:haha I did see that, I thought he did a great job I loved that movie as a kid what about you	agent_2:I have not seen it. I watched the documentary on him and it was brilliant. He was such a great talent with so much trouble in his life.
140667	agent_2:Some of it is so out there, so when they leave i do google it.  Some things Id rather not know.  Like all of their youtubers. agent_1:Did you read about Google changing the boundaries for land disputes? Seems passive... agent_2:I did.  I guess they dont want to get involved.  They should just go with whatever border is set, and if it changes, then change it.	agent_1:It makes both side happy! I think they should be able to fix it though.
98876	agent_1:haha you love the moon! yes I do like that 70's show, I guess they tried to remake it in the UK but it was cancelled after only ten episodes, bummer that they missed out! agent_2:I heard that, I guess remakes don't always make out too good on television lol, and yes the moon is amazing to me...I am a big fan of the lunar eclipses and taking photos of the moon , I think it's great...almost as great as my friends think Baseball is hahahaa agent_1:haha well are your friends Japanese by chance? Apparently baseball is so popular over there they they can't believe it is literally the national pastime of the USA	agent_2:Hahaha, I have heard that too, but no they are not lol. my friends love the Yankee's, I guess they hit 144 home runs in 2017 I guess that is pretty good!
150566	agent_1:Well radio has continued to persist despite the dominance of tv. Did you know there is a website you can listen to thousands of classic radio drama episodes for free? Way to keep radio alive! agent_2:Great. Now I can forever feel guilty about missing all the classic radio shows. I hope it is in english--not like that Finnish station that that broadcasts in classical Latin. Talk about a snoozer... agent_1:Well aside from radio, do you watch any tv?	"agent_2:Sure. I watch reruns of the british version of ""That 70s Show."" Word-for-word remake of the US show, but it was cancelled after 10 shows.  Bummer. How about you?"
67779	agent_2:I really like their discount site, they have great prices, and Amazon has great customer service. agent_1:They really do, I have only had a small problem or two in the last 10 years and they are quick to fix it.  agent_2:Do you have an Alexa device? I'm listening to my weather forcast now. To see if the snow will ever end.	agent_1:No I don't but think they are very useful.  Nice talking with you today, I hope you have a good day.
135175	agent_1:I can't imagine! Have you heard that it is impossible to overlap two phone books' pages together and then separate them? I wonder if that's just a myth? agent_2:I never knew that!  New York's area code is 212 because it was the fastest to dial on a rotary phone back in the day. agent_1:I have heard that but shouldn't the number be 121, then? Did you know that Earth is the 3rd planet from the sun?	agent_2:lol I did know that about the earth!  A sad note is that more than 80 percent of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed.
121787	agent_2:In class they also discussed the history of clothing. Did you know that humans are the only creature that wears clothes? I didn't know that, ha ha. agent_1:I think they should put pants on horses... my son asks too many questions at the petting zoo. agent_2:The class learned that we wear more or less clothes depending on the circumstances.  For instance if it's cold we wear more and if it's hot we wear less.  Also different cultures wear different types of clothes.	agent_1:Pilrims clothing was colorful and only wore black for special occasions...
146317	agent_2:What was it? agent_1:212, crazy, guess what city?  agent_2:Oh new york area code. I'm glad we have upgraded to cell phones since then 	agent_1:Yeah,me too. Did you know an iphone has more computing power than our Nuke deterrent?
46721	agent_2:lol   agent_1:Now only if I looked like a famous celebrity, maybe I could become famous! agent_2:How? 	agent_1:Well, if Bill Nye did it, it's possible.
133521	agent_2:lol  The US presidents guest house is larger than the white house.   Must be to make visitors more cozy. agent_1:Maybe, I guess the President's guest house has to be larger than the White House to accommodate the visitors of staff  agent_2:That's a good point!  Up until 1805 the runner up in the US presidential elections automatically became the vice president.  I could see Hillary and Trump duking it out if that was like that today.  lol	agent_1:A Hillary Clinton/Trump administration would make one hell of a reality tv show
62860	agent_2:We wreck it! I can't believe that when the earth was first formed the day only lasted 5.5 hours long. agent_1:I couldn't handle that. I can't stand the 8 or 9 odd hours during daylight savings time.  agent_2:I can't either. Earth is the densest planet in the solar system and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. Pretty impressive.	agent_1:That is pretty impressive. Did you know that in September of 2010, the UN appointed an official ambassador to Extraterrestrials in the case they would ever make contact with earth. So Trump is behind with the Space Force then?
143583	agent_2:Jim Carrey doesnt do dramas agent_1:I think that was a good thing because he is so much better at comedies. I think it's cool he only wanted the movies that project positivity. agent_2:Do you enjoy football?	agent_1:Yeah I definitely like watching football. I was quite a big fan of Tim Tebow at one time And was surprised to hear that Kiss bought an arena football team and offered him a contract.
64966	agent_2:Aristotle is some heavy stuff.  I find it interesting that because of a $40 late free on Apollo 13, Reed Hastings was inspired to start NetflixAst agent_1:Haha, yeah he is. Such a big influence on the world as we know it. Apollo 13 is about the first moon landing right? agent_2:Correct, with good ole' Tom Hanks, great movie.  Speaking of NASA they have a list of accurate space terminology terms that writers can use in sci-fi stories	agent_1:I wonder why they do that? Is it to make it more real, or not to confuse the public? Is it not considered Sci-Fi if writers do not follow it
159839	agent_2:It sure has. I have been watching House lately, even though the show has ended agent_1:What do you think about that show? I never really got into it but I did know that Hugh Laurie makes a ton of money for every episode agent_2:Yeah he got $700,000 per episode, that is mind boggling to me	agent_1:That is an insane amount. I would never stop making episodes haha what are your thoughts on Jim Carrey?
72266	agent_1:I wish I'd seen that movie. I'm hoping to buy the set of them soon. I really liked Depp in The Secret Window, too. agent_2:I dont think Ive seen that movie.  Yes, You should!  I got my pre order for the movie to come out on blu ray haha.  I really loved him in Pirates of the caribbean as well!   agent_1:Yes, he was great in that movie...I named a cat Sparrow after him in it. I think he was good in the Sleepy Hollow movie as well.	agent_2:yeah that was a good movie,  it was so nice of him to adopt his horse in the movie!
23766	agent_2:Never heard of him.  agent_1:Well he was nominated 13 times for the best cinematography Oscar but never won the award, that must be really frustrating. agent_2:Constant recognition, but no award. You're right, very frustrating. Have you heard of Chinese-American James Wong Howe?	agent_1:No I haven't heard about him, any interesting facts?
164121	agent_2:for sure, I would be donating left and right. I love dogs! Do you watch TV? agent_1:Some, not as much as I use to. When I have time, I'm on the internet, where I can look up shows I like. I do have cable but I rarely use it. agent_2:yea me too. I was a fan of pokemon back in the  day. they have 750 episodes	agent_1:Yes, it was always on it seems. Do you remember Thomas the tank engine?
2188	agent_2:Oh no I don't do DVDs either just the streaming service.  It's too bad it doesn't have Game of Thrones though, that show has gotten 37 emmy awards. agent_1:I do like GOT! George RR Martin is the author and a genius! agent_2:It is such a hit parents are naming their kids Arya.  Only a couple more months until the last season starts.	agent_1:ya I can't wait, weird that charlie Chaplins granddaughter is in the show too!
573	agent_2:I'm pretty sure that it has, I know that it made a ton of money. Apparently the villain used to sing that song I mentioned, Let It Go, but the song was so happy that they changed the character agent_1:that's good thinkg. I bet the song is up for an award somewhere. Who were the people involved in the film? agent_2:There's like a princess, a reindeer and a snowman, they're like them three most important characters. Also this is the first movie that was produced by Walt Disney and directed by a woman.	agent_1:Not many films get directed by woman. That's good that she got the job. Good for Disney! They know how to spot talent.
35165	agent_2:Yes they are expensive but no fuel cost, and they run linux! The powerwall is also on my list. Much better then a gas generator for power backup. agent_1:Oh yes that is for sure, I drive bmw and I know that gas is spoiling the environment, though I adore my car's design lol  agent_2:BMW's are nice but everything Elon Musk does is cool. I am a big fan of SpaceX as well.	agent_1:really, and I adore sports cars, M6 pack is my everything. And did you know that The toyota group owns 10% of tesla, and tesla actually helped to develop their 2nd gen rav4ev?
153813	agent_1:Do you not like Trump? I think he is the greatest president ever! agent_2:I don't like him at all, he is too stubborn for me but I respect your point of view agent_1:WOW! Did you know that that the president of indonesia made a pop album, 3 TIMES!	agent_2:I didnt know that! 3 times? does he know he has a country to run lol
86178	agent_2:That's something to think about, I don't know maybe back then hunters were braver than they are now. I'm pretty sure food was harder to come about, maybe I am wrong, but that's just my opinion. agent_1:Interesting. Well, that was the prehistoric times. agent_2:Yes, so true. If you haven't been, would you like to visit one of those caves if you get the opportunity?	agent_1:To be honest. I do not think I have the courage to go by myself.
101076	agent_1:Ahah see? I wonder how many people get brainwashed into thinking he really did all that! I personally don't think anything he says can be trusted, we don't even know how old he really is! agent_2:Agreed! And can you believe Kim was voted sexiest man alive by the Onion and China of all places believes it? Ha! agent_1:Ahah maybe power really is that alluring. He certainly tries to appear like a loving, fun person, after all he ordered the renovation of their theme parks, who would have even thought they had theme parks!	agent_2:I know, right? Plus no one knows how old he is. Not to mention he ordered the execution of his own uncle in 2013!
74501	agent_1:Is that AM or FM radio? I gotta get that station! agent_2:Its an am station, it can be a bit boring but it sure would be interesting I might have to goole that. agent_1:Yeah, me too! I hope it did not go the way of the Dodo bird, that famously extinct pigeon-like creature. 	agent_2:It would be nice to see a Dodo bird come back to life, birds have hollow bones so thats why they are lightweighted
90183	agent_1:My favorite team is Barcelona and national team the US and then Argentina, do you have a favorite team? agent_2:No, I don't, but I like the new mascot for the Philadelphia Union. agent_1:Phang the Snake, sounds like an awesome New Mascot!	agent_2:Yeah, apparently he has a mohawk and legs.
30724	agent_2:Ballet dancer Tupac? I wonder if he got teased over that agent_1:Probably why he never mentioned it. Ballet dancers can go through up to 4 shoes in a week! agent_2:Thats a lot of money for shoes, Im guessing those shoes arent cheap maybe they buy tons of them and get discounts	agent_1:Yeah I bet they are pretty expensive. Dance is great though, very aesthetic with symbolic value.
105000	agent_1:True. Do you like JIm Carrey? agent_2:I love him. DO you know why he does not make dramas anymore? agent_1:Yes he does not because they do not portray positivity	agent_2:Yeah. Do you listen to radio dramas?
88494	agent_1:That's what they all say.... I am from chicago so I am a bulls fan. We're not good... agent_2:But you have the glory years to look back on.  Cleveland will cling to that one win for a long time. You're are probably biased but, LeBron or Jordan? agent_1:LeBron. I do not understand how he does what he does. JOrdan is the GOAT but lebron is a freak. I think the differrencce is in attitude...	agent_2:I was in DC when Jordan played for the Wizards, not quite the player he was, but still had more than just about everyone else.
111141	agent_1:lol who knows. I wonder who started the candy drawer tradition. Seems like a good one to have to get through the drivel some people put forward in bills.  agent_2:That is probably the best seat in the house! Especially during those long discussion and filibusters they like to do! agent_1:At least it is stocked with the good stuff from pennsylvania instead of some weird state specific candy. 	agent_2:or butterscoth candy lol. I would like to stay at the guest house at the white house as well, which is bigger than the white house itself!
134195	agent_2:I had no idea! My son loves that show. He's known the names of every single train since he was one.  agent_1:wow so sweet, did your son ever watched pokemon? agent_2:No, he hasn't seen that one. I know there's like 750 episodes. The pokemon craze is so huge. 	agent_1:yes exactly. Does your son love dogs?
105321	agent_2:I would just sue for a few years pay, not 800,000 though. agent_1:I guess he wants to punish them? teach them a lesson? sometimes numbers are just to scare people into settling. Anyway, great chat! agent_2:Yes, good information. I am sure he will win as it is against the law to discriminate.	agent_1:I wish him well. He has a good cause. Have a good night!
141589	agent_1:Never hoid of it! What is it? agent_2:A band that had to rerecord their hits after losing the rights to them agent_1:That sounds like some lawyer getting them into trouble! Screw lawyers! Do you listen to the radio at all?	agent_2:I do actually, going to work. In am you can hear Jupiter's storms
114717	agent_1:Mark Zuckerberg does suffer from red-green colorblindness. Thats why facebook is primarily blue agent_2:Well he chose a color that is very visually pleasing, He definitely has an eye for aesthetics agent_1:Are you into country music?	agent_2:Yes but only because of one artist that went on joe rogans show his name is Wheeler walker Jr do you know who he is
11325	agent_1:Do you like bird? maybe have birdwatching as one of your hobbies? agent_2:I like birds but I'm not an official birdwatcher.  I am a bit surprised to learn that the dodo bird is a real thing.  The are actually part of the pidgeon family.  agent_1:They are? I thought dodo birds were ficticious or extinct at least, you know that some birds travel really long distances without a rest	agent_2:So did I.  Did you know that hummingbirds are known to take spiderwebs to use on their nests?  Little thieves...
151475	agent_1:Hi!  Are you a football fan? agent_2:No I am not. However, I like Tom Brady. He is my favorite quarterback. agent_1:He is really talented, and has a lot of super bowls under his belt.	agent_2:I agree. Did you know that the New England Patriots have either won or lost the super bowl by 3 or 4 points with Tom Brady on their team?
52617	agent_1:Hi. Do you follow politics?  Texas elected their first female governor before some states had even ratified the 19th amendment! agent_2:Hello - I do follow politics a little. That's pretty cool Texas elected their first female governor before some states ratified that amendment. agent_1:She was only the second woman to be governor in the nation. As for governors standing out, Ralph carr was the only governor to oppose japanese internment during ww2.	agent_2:That's interesting. I saw that Arnold commuted 3 hours everyday when he was governor of California.
125074	agent_1:So freaky, I am curious to see what other advancements in roboting will take place in the next ten years.  agent_2:I'm just glad robots can debone a chicken with surgical precision.  My cooking just got alot easier. Lol agent_1:Yeah if we could all just have robot chefs in our kitchen that would make life so much easier!	agent_2:How true.  Did you know the US military uses an Xbox controller to control one of its eod robots?
150029	agent_1:Even if he didn't he did make a signature move and the name paul d hubbard will be forever remembered for his contribution agent_2:Baker Mayfield thought of quitting due to gaming agent_1:He sure must have had quite the confidence as a pro on halo 3	agent_2:He must have been. You'll never know what else he plays.
116023	"agent_1:Nice. Wonder if they make LaCoste shirts as button downs, where the collar tips are fastened to the shirt with buttons? agent_2:Yeah, every one I've seen is ""button up"" agent_1:People get those terms mixed up so often. Good to know the difference!"	agent_2:Very true.  I'm learning things here!
158864	"agent_1:Sure. But they also had problems with the Russian new media. Trump, not so much. ""Very unpatriotic"" is projection.  agent_2:Well, it's true that most Americans have negative feelings toward the media. agent_1:If thats true, maybe there is nothing wrong with being the ""enemy of the people"""	agent_2:It all depends upon what you can believe. Gallup poll indicates an all time low in regard to journalists. NY Times said they had to post guards at their building.
10957	agent_2:I have never been there.  Most of pets are used by humans as company, protection and entertainment.  Some people use pets as working animals. agent_1:Here is a crazy fact to end with. There are more tigers living as pets in the USA than living wild in asia, very interesting. It was so great chatting with you! agent_2:Wow, I did not know that.  Nice chatting with you too.	agent_1:Have a great weekend!
158567	agent_1:I like him yes. Did you know he was a backup QB? agent_2:Yes and he was never started, what a loss of talent agent_1:True. Do you know who Alex Smith is?	agent_2:Yes he is a QB who completed college in two years
318	agent_1:I like their relationshop in the movies. Chewy is a very loyal friend agent_2:In the canon Chewy has a family a wife and 2 sons.  agent_1:Thats interesting. I heard George RR Martin had an illustration that Chewie is based off of	agent_2:I heard that too, it was on the cover of one of his small stories. It is a peculiar creature when you think about it.
99555	agent_1:That's an effective way to lose some calories for sure. agent_2:Did you know the kid from the shining, Danny he didn't even know he was in a horror movie until years later?  agent_1:Haha I did not know that. Pretty interesting though. If you watch a horror movie before viewing abstract art, you will enjoy the art more.	agent_2:That's kinda strange. I wonder why that is? I don't blame them for not telling him. He probably thought it was just a drama.
160516	"agent_1:That's so sad. The goat was probably so scared. agent_2:Yeah! They even coined the action as ""goat-napping"", that is kind of embarassing that the Navy can't control these events agent_1:Times sure have changed since 1953. Their pranks back then were so cruel!"	agent_2:I'm not sure if this is a prank or not but the university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink, what do you think?
147049	agent_1:Do you like football? agent_2:I love it!  Love the NFL! agent_1:How often do you watch the nfl?	agent_2:I watch as much as I can.  Sunday games, Monday night, and thurs. night.  I heard Aaron Rogers and the Green Bay packers are close to signing a contract extension.
83335	agent_1:Me too, I enjoyed it. Did your parents give you a to do list when you went?  agent_2:They did not. I didn't go to college until I was 22 because I was in the military.  agent_1:I didn't go until later either, so my parent didn't give me a to do list. Did you know in South Africa it is legal to equip your car with a flame thrower? 	agent_2:That's pretty crazy. It says because of the common carjackings.
163943	agent_1:Man, that Deshaun Watson can run.  Reminds me of Michael Vick. agent_2:He is with the Dallas Cowboys, isn't he? agent_1:Houston. But the Dallas guy can run too.They are both dangerous out side the pocket, as Jay Gruden has said, but I wonder if this can last in the long run...given the injury risk.	agent_2:Is Watson a quarterback?
50685	agent_1:It's weird to considering the incredibles are set in the 1960s. agent_2:I never knew that but I guess it makes sense if you really look at the aesthetic of it. agent_1:Speaking of weird, the character Edna Mode is voiced by a man, Brad Bird.	agent_2:yea! Shes the short little lady who makes their costumes isnt she?
13557	agent_2:It is! I was listening to some Florence and the Machine. I prefer listening plugged into a desktop than using the app. My service isn't the best on my phone - but at I bet it's better than what you get at the top of Mount Everest agent_1:I'm still surprised you get 3g at the top of Mount Everest! Maybe to post selfies I'm sure. agent_2:I mean, if I could ever make it to the top I would definitely call everyone I love (and everyone I hate) to tell them!	agent_1:Haha you and me both. I think the internet has come a long way. It even helped introduce KPop to everybody!
82025	"agent_1:I heard about him.  he thought operators were directing his business elsewhere. agent_2:Yep lol. Dolphins can communicate over the telephone which is really cool. agent_1:That is neat.  I wonder if they know which dolphin is on the other end, like they recognize their ""voice"""	agent_2:They are very smart animals so that's a possibility.
126835	agent_2:HA! Speaking of gray and gloomy... So if you had the opportunity to go anywhere and live, where would it be? agent_1:That's easy :) Norway ! Cool fresh air, great health care and education, beautiful sights :) You ? agent_2:Norway? That's shocking... Have you ever been? Do you travel a lot? what's keeping you from moving now? Me: Somewhere warm like the Gulf of Mexico side of FL	agent_1:I haven't been but I actually did a lot of research and some of my friends moved there. I can't go now, I got two kids where first is in collage now and the other will be in two years, but once they are independent...  it's open season for daddy ;)
64663	agent_2:They amaze me. I had no idea until I read about it that there are cables carrying phone and internet data laying across oceans.  agent_1:Yeah. The cords are only 2.7 inches in diameter! agent_2:That is nuts. I had no idea there were cables laying on the ocean floor. 	agent_1:Yup. Well, ciao!
16263	"agent_1:I love Lady Gaga. She seems so nice. Elton John named her his son's godmother. agent_2:That's pretty neat, I wonder what kind of gifts or treatment being the godson of Lady Gaga gets especially when she's had so many successful singles from ""Poker Face"" to ""Bad Romance"" to ""Just Dance"", I'm familiar with all of them! agent_1:When ever Poker Face comes on the radio, my son asks me ""How do you wake up Lady Gaga? Poker Face! HAHAHA!"" Gets me everytime!"	"agent_2:Lol! That's hilarious! I'll have to tell that to my son next time, he's a goofball. He told me when Frozen came out and the songs kept playing over and over again and asked me whether I knew what that song really meant and referred to and I said ""No"" and he said it's talking about a fart and encouraging people to fart. Oh boys."
117775	agent_2:I used to listen as a kid. Not so much now. I use the Internet. Sometimes listen to podcasts. agent_1:That's cool.  I listen to my radio on my commute and from work every day. agent_2:That's a great time to listen. Better than using a smart phone to text.	agent_1:I hear that.  I see way to much of that on the roads! I'm thinking about equipping my car with a flamethrower, like they do in South Africa.
57427	agent_1:Do you like to read? agent_2:I like to read a little, but I don't get into novels.  Do you like to read? agent_1:I do, reading is the means for language acquisition, communication, sharing ideas so I think its really important to read	agent_2:That is very true, without literature we would have no idea of our histories.  Reading also requires creativity and critical analysis, people grow more the more they read.
150743	agent_2:I don't have a problem with it but I don't know if there would be many willing to do it or coaches willing to draft them.  agent_1:Yeah, the NFL seems retrograde in the ways they treat women, cheerleaders are forbidden to eat in the same restaurant that a player is eating in.   agent_2:That is odd. I think its crazy that only 2 African American QB's have won the super bowl. 	agent_1:Maybe there is more racism with the coaches and the managers than we thought...
41763	agent_2:No, I didn't know that about them, interesting.  And the Grizz, curious to see how you will be in a few seasons, was surprised to see Gasol leave.  agent_1:Yeah, it's hard to replace someone like him. I do like the pickup they made with Noah. Hopefully they'll continue building up.  agent_2:Yeah and Jonas is a monster and a workhorse as well. 	agent_1:Did you know that Air Jordan's were banned upon introduction by the NBA? However, Jordan were them anyways, as Nike was willing to pay the fine each game.
104890	"agent_2:No, I didn't! I know that they have a ""Candy Desk"" and they have since 1968! Which is basically a desk closest to the door full of candy for them to all eat. Haha agent_1:Wow! That would really make the job a lot more enjoyable. agent_2:I wouldn't mind a candy desk, right now! In 1988, a US senator invoked a rule to allow the sergeant-at-arms to arrest absent senators and bring them to the chamber to vote!"	"agent_1:Oh that's extreme! I wonder if the candy is any good they is kept in the ""candy desk""?"
74726	agent_2:Very meta, you would think they would have just made a sub reddit talking about reddit! agent_1:Oh, I'm sure they've got that as well.  You know, you mentioned the first comment, neatly enough one of the first post was about the downing street memo agent_2:Interesting, I don't think i've heard about that before! Reddit raised 50 million dollars in 2014 in a funding round led by Snoop dog, Jared leto and a few others!	agent_1:Wow, that's quite a bit of money!  Hope they put it all to a good cause!  :)  Maybe next up they'll do a reddit radio!
99431	agent_1:I like the British definition better it seems so fancy to think of a regular shirt as a dress shirt. I wonder what their word is for what we would call a regular shirt. agent_2:That's true I hadn;t thought of that. I personally like russians with their ushankas dancing to russian hard bass.  agent_1:Oh definitely. Cant forget the Canadian Mounted police with their fancy peaked hats!	agent_2:yes cheeki breeki indeed my friend. Overall I feel as though we have made great progress in the world of fashion for all nations with this discussion.
66607	agent_2:I didn't like him, until five years ago. Did his voice change, like Elton John's did? agent_1:I'm not sure did it change? I just know that when he was a kid his favorite superhero with Spider-Man, I definitely would not have guessed that agent_2:That is odd. I would have thought Captain America. Have you heard the Korean style of rap called Compliment Battle?	agent_1:I have heard of that. I like how it is more positive than the other types of rapping that can go on. Have you seen the 1998 Rugrats movie by the way?
121760	agent_1:Well, they play 40% canadian music, it is the law agent_2:I've never hear much of canadian music, I don't know if I enjoy listening to it being played a lot on the radio agent_1:Yeah that is a lot of Justin Bieber for sure	agent_2:I don't know what's worse, Justing Biber or listening to nuntii latina in Finland
104629	agent_1:Hi, how are you tonight? agent_2:hi, I'm good. how about you? agent_1:I'm great! Do you follow the US Senate at all?	agent_2:A little bit. Why? what's going on with the senate?
84308	agent_2:huge diffrence in the genre from then to now.  agent_1:It was very nice talking to you and you seem very knowledgeable! agent_2:you to man, thanks for the time and happy holidays	agent_1:Same to you!
74952	agent_1:Yeah that is cool. Did you know Judge Judy makes $123,000 per episode?  agent_2:wow thats impressive, I think she is paid second most of all the celebrities right? only lebron makes more than her agent_1:Really? That cannot be right, but perhaps it is so. 	agent_2:ya I don't know but PIxar apparently has a secret room that only celebs are allowed in
122390	agent_1:Holy cow that is insane. I still need to watch that movie. Is it good? I also need to watch Wall-e which was named after Walter Elias Disney! agent_2:No I haven't seen any of those yet too busy watching ESPN and their emmy winning yellow line on football games agent_1:Yes that was a great invention on their part. I love watching American football and I think it's the best version of them all!	agent_2:Yea, I love watching Benjarvus Green-Ellis play, he has never fumbled the ball
142838	agent_2:I enjoyed the Pokemongo game, but thats about it.  Never got into the shows. agent_1:Are you a Simpsons fan? agent_2:I am!  Do you know Homer had 188 jobs in the first 400 episodes?  	agent_1:I didn't know that!  I always seem to remember him working at the Nuke plant.  There is only 1 episode where Bart neither appears nor is mentioned.
62465	agent_2:Yeah exactly Did you ever use a phone book too? agent_1:No I have not but I heard if two of them get stuck together, you cannot separate them agent_2:WOw I want to try that actually. Unicef donated clean water when you don not use your hpone	agent_1:Wow that is amazing. iPhones have more computing power than the US nuclear icbm deterrent
72837	agent_2:That is my sons drug, I mean game, of choice.  He's played a bunch of other video games but Fortnite is the one that he'll play if he were allowed just one. agent_1:Yep! Mine is addicted too. Did you know that the first multiplayer first person shooter used a music protocol for networking? agent_2:I did not know that, and now you say it I have to admit I don't really know what that means.  Do your have phones yet?	agent_1:Do we have phones? We all have cell phones.
94318	agent_1:The air must be so fresh, nice destination, I also want to go to Japan, hopefully one day agent_2:Japan sparks joy for me too, although it costs about $300 to travel across Japan due to all the to highways.  So, bring quarters. agent_1:That sounds expensive, still might be worth it, did you know the Iceland has no public rail service, 	agent_2:They need to talk with the Dutch, who are putting in a commuter bus system that travels at 160 mph. How else would Icelanders get around?
42710	agent_1:I know how your feel, everyday its something upsetting!!  Aww, I didn't know that is nice about Old Hickory!! agent_2:Wow, a man wore 70 items of clothing in China to avoid a bagging charge.  Times must be tough over there. agent_1:Really, I never heard of that!! 	agent_2:Did you know that people used to d o their laundry in Old Faithful?
84069	agent_2:Not something that I would be able to do. I don't have the expert eye. I don't have my clothes tailored usually. A bit too expensive. You? agent_1:I only have my suits tailored. Although I was watching a YouTube channel where they show you how to tailor regular shirts and they actually look pretty cool when they're tailored to your body. also it seems pretty easy. Would you ever buy clothes that were originally from unclaimed baggage? agent_2:I guess if they were cheap enough. Cameras? Sure. There are probably pretty good deals in that store in Alabama.	agent_1:Yep I think so. Do you watch any horror movies by the way? I know that Stephen King thought that Bambi should be considered a horror movie LOL
142054	agent_2:Yeah, we dont get the info until after the fact. people are price sensitive so they dont choose based on safety or ethics. agent_1:Ethics are disappearing.  If people didn;t get called out for stuff in the news we'd be in a dictatorship by now.  Seems like we are getting there some days.  Journalists need to be treated like heroes agent_2:It is a risky profession. many journalists around the world die every year trying to report on events. It is not entertainment, but people need to pay attention.	agent_1:True dat, my friend.  I know they get Pulitzers and other prizes.  Sometimes they end up dead, even.  Entertainment makes me laugh.  News about bombing civilians in Iraq doesn't make me laugh
122230	"agent_1:Maybe they are hard to hack, require a long time, im not sure but they must have their reasons.  agent_2:Let's talk about elections. Nevada is the only state to have a ""none of these candidates"" voting option for presidential elections. What do you think? agent_1:I guess its a choice as valid as others, if you dont like the politicians you can also stay at home and save yourself the trouble"	agent_2:I think that it might get people to the polls to vote on other issues. Since 1900, the taller candidate has won the us presidential election 75% of the time. Maybe NBA players should run for office.
91257	agent_2:I would love to listen to some old dramas! thanks for the tip. i will check that out. agent_1:Yeah I bet they broadcast some pretty interesting stuff. agent_2:I should look for war of the worlds. that was a radio classic.  	agent_1:In 1989 a news program broadcast entirely in classical latin
154266	agent_1:Whatever that means. :) I do appreciate football players who value their education. Alex Smith took so many AP tests in high school that he was a junior when he entered university. agent_2:YEs, how brilliant! He earned his BA in 2 years! agent_1:Crazy, then he was on his way to earning his master's degree. Kuddos to him!	agent_2:How about that Baker Mayfield? He considered leaving football to play videogames!
140817	agent_2:I must have taken a long time, but in his case, the time he spent playing video games was worth it. By the way, do you like Mc Donalds? agent_1:I eat there from time to time. I prefer other fast food.  agent_2:Ok, good. Did you know they did add drive-thru since 1975?	agent_1:I didn't know they added them so late. I thought that McD's had drive-thrus before then.
85735	agent_2:Oh wow, that sounds like fun, I have never been to Wrigley. I don't get the chance to go very much but would like to! Did you hear about the guy who found 3 million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards??? In an attic, wow! agent_1:Wow! That's a lot of games at wrigley! I also like going to minor league baseball games. I was schocked to learn that the managers wear the uniform in case they have to play. agent_2:That is a lot of games you could go to hahaa! Really? That's interesting! I wonder if they ever have to play?  One day I may have to travel and get to Wrigley for a game one day, would live to visit the stadium.	agent_1:Yeah. Up until 2005, a married couple could have told you when the games were scheduled, they made the schedule!
143821	agent_2:They canceled on here in wisconsin for madden payoffs. I loved going to play in those agent_1:Well, happy holidays and happy turking.  Good luck! agent_2:good luck to you too	agent_1:I thought this was 10 turns, why isn't it clearing?
18038	agent_2:That is absolutely crazy.  I guess that is why google's data center uses about .01% of all total worldwide electricity agent_1:It would explain a lot. It once went down for about 5 minutes. Imagine if that was longer? agent_2:I love the fact that g-mail used to be a free email server on Garfield's website	agent_1:Oh that is funny. Interesting thing about the borders and google maps too, adjusting them to what each country says
62966	agent_2:I don't know, but Netflix today has the same number  of movies that a library would have books. agent_1:Interesting. Do you go to the library a lot?  agent_2:Sometimes, did you know a man falsely imprisoned studied law at the library to prove his innocence?	agent_1:WOW! That's great. He was able to get out of jail?
104129	agent_2:I do use amazon. I love it. Do you use it or just wanna work there? agent_1:I love Amazon Prime. I don't really want to work there since it sounds really stressful. I enjoy shopping on Amazon especially during the holidays. Apparently USPS has a contract with Amazon to deliver packages on Sunday. I wondered how that worked. agent_2:I remember a few years ago when they went public I was going to buy a bunch of stock at like $300/share. It's now around $1900. Im an idiot!	agent_1:Oh wow, I wish I had bought some as well.  It's amazing what Jeff Bezos has been able to develop since he founded it 25 years ago!
108227	"agent_2:Yeah, it is used by a lot of people. Gangnam Style got so many views that they had to upgrade the view count integer to 64 bits. agent_1:Oh, that video was the worst!! I've heard Justin Bieber's ""baby"" is the most disliked video on You Tube. agent_2:It is pretty annoying. Netflix and YouTube together make up half of peak internet traffic in North America. Wonder how many people are secretly watching and listening to ""Baby"""	agent_1:Haha-good one! Did you know that the police actually have their own You Tube called Blue Tube?
42742	agent_2:No, I don't. How?  agent_1:He enrolled in drama class because all the pretty girls were there agent_2:That's awesome. He's a great actor. Apparently Hugh Jackman went to comic con wearing the full costume and nobody noticed. 	agent_1:Hahaha he is so funny. Nice chatting with you
142289	agent_2:Wow! Yes, as a matter of fact I know alot about the sun such as did you know the sun is a billionth the size of the biggest star discovered in our galaxy! blows my mind! agent_1:Holy smokes!  Hope that star never wanders this way.  We'll be obliterated and wouldn't even know what hit us.  A lightning bolt surprisingly is 5 times hotter than the surface of the sun! agent_2:ouch! yikes, for sure! What im curious is why I pay 400 a month in electricity when the sun produces enough energy in one second to meet the needs of the entire planet for 500 000!!! 	agent_1:So true!  Did you know that the sun is actually white and only looks yellow due to atmospheric scattering?
35289	agent_2:For sure it has grown. Who knew, Pakistan has a jazz orchestra topping the charts! agent_1:Yes humans are amazing how they can play such great music. There is even a certain sound frequency that causes fear in music but luckily I have never heard it.  agent_2:Yes your lucky! I think I have when we go to Halloween Horror Nights each year in those haunted houses at Universal Studios. Its probably that instrument the waterphone they use in horror films! lol	agent_1:I love that I have been there. It was epic. Stranger Things was the best one ever. I ran so fast lol. Humans are actually designed for long distance running!
133311	agent_1:I see. I don't follow football really, I never played as a kid. I'm a model, like Tom brady's wife, gisele bundchen, I make a buttload of cash. agent_2:Yes, they both have plenty.  I heard that Carson Palmar, Jimmy Graham, Calvin Johnsn, and Tom Brady all have NFL rules named after them. agent_1:Yep! Also, New orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player and if they are already dining at a restaurant and an nfl player comes in after, they are required to leave. Isn't that silly?	agent_2:That is ridiculous.  Changing topics, are you a music fan?  I know a lot about music.  In fact, in 2010 Lou Reed and his wife held a high frequency concert for dogs.
41488	agent_2:No, I did not know that. I just thought they were weird, made up names agent_1:Some of them have animal names. There are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth! agent_2:I read that animals develop white patches on their foreheads when domesticated. I wonder why.	agent_1:I don't know why, either. t has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total.
86824	agent_1:hi there, do you play any instruments? agent_2:I used to play guitars back in my college days a little but never had time to practice so I quit eventually. How about you?   agent_1:Oh I see , no I do not know how to play it. At least not as good as to set the speakers on fire like Van Halen did	"agent_2:Yeah, Eddie was awesome back in his day. I saw him in Van Halen on his Jump tour back in 1984 so I am up there!  I didn't know Eddie played ""Beat It' though."
112221	agent_2:It would put job growth and economic growth at risk. It puts pressure on washington to pass a budget... agent_1:Federal rules do not allow non-essential individuals to work for the goverment without pay, workers will be furloughed for the duration of a shutdown. agent_2:Such a shame. Gov contractors receive $1.3B so they are affected too.	agent_1:Federal rules do not allow non-essential individuals to work for government without pay. The government is responsbible for civilian jobs in the washington area with weeekly pay.
87923	agent_1:I mean 75mil isn't a small sum, but neither is several billion lol agent_2:But that is the what the world values these days. They think money is made from thin air. The truth is that, according to modern physice, the entire universe could have been created out of nothing... Personally, I think pizza predated the cosmos. agent_1:Well there is still some hope for humanity. When a teacher talked about her low income students, a kind passenger gave her more than 500 in cash for funds to better teach them	agent_2:Sure! The world has a lot to offer. Just think of Pixar, the world famous entertainment company. They spent three years studying the physics of hair to give bounce to the hair of Merida from Brave. Now those are great priorities!
48376	agent_1:It's so popular in 2013, they actually dubbed it Navajo! James Earl Jones does make me thing of that new Lion King movie coming out. Looks fantastic! agent_2:Oh, James Earl Jones! I heard he spent only 2 and a half hours recording all of Darth Vadar's lines for Star Wars and was paid $7500. agent_1:Haha that must be for the original move or trilogy. I'm sure he got paid for the new three in the early 2000's. And he's definitely getting paid for Lion King.	agent_2:So that's a new lion king movie that's coming back? I like anything with big cats including lion dances. The Smithsonian has an annual Chinese New Year festival with a lion dance and acrobats. I'd love to see it.
17718	"agent_2:It could sure help, the processed foods and sugars are what leads to weight gain and often diabetes. agent_1:I see. The old ""Let them eat cake"" poor advice. If kids cut out milk, what about bone growth? agent_2:I think it would be fine with a veggie rich diet, and with fruits.  There are ways to get nutrients other than just milk."	agent_1:Do you wonder that too many kids are influenced by celebs like Miley Cyrus or Marie Osmond, who have promoted certain diets - for a fee?
149404	agent_2:I guess they might know if they see your posts or not.  agent_1:Maybe they just think I'm not posting anything ;) agent_2:true! So do you like any Tv shows?	agent_1:Plenty :) Now I'm watching Ray Donovan :) You ?
94481	agent_1:It is curious to think that so many companies are offering streaming services, it might be overwhelming and costly for consumers if content is locked to a single service. agent_2:I agree, but I also think it is nice to pick which streaming services you want and do not want instead of buying a cable package of channels I never watch. agent_1:That's true, I just hope that certain services aren't too restrictive on what content you are allowed to watch. Disney entering streaming services would be a great thing for fans, to watch classics or new movies, if Disney offers it.	agent_2:It would also be crappy if you had to pay per movie still.
140690	agent_1:Yes, I can say it often slips my mind what a giant company they've become. Back in 2013 Google went down for about 5 minutes, and took 40% of all web traffic with it! I can only guess that they've grown substantially in the years since. agent_2:Yeah, and i'm sure they have some pretty good hackers to prevent that from happening again, too!! lol agent_1:Probably. They must have a ton of employees! Did you know they call their headquarters the Googleplex? That sounds like something from a movie to me!	agent_2:Yep, and that they reorganized their interest and called it Alphabet Inc.
158356	agent_1:there was no official govt shutdown then, but there may as well have been. four days? agent_2:Yeah there should've been a shut down! I bet the story was told on the radio about what had happened. There's a lot of interesting stuff that happened on the radio but I don't really listen to it anymore. agent_1:i used to listen to the radio when i was younger. didnt have a choice. now i use the internet. i dont have a choice about quitting that though. im addicted.	agent_2:Yes it is so addicting! I wonder if the radio was addicting back in the day. There's a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free!
4457	agent_1:No that doesn't sound like it.  But I think he made up for it quite a bit.  Do you know who the first team to win back to back world series was? agent_2:Yes.  The Cubs.  The last time they won, the Ottoman Empire still existed. agent_1:Yeah good call.  Are you a fan of the Cubs at all?	agent_2:I do like them.  Their stadium is so old and so classic.  I guess what I said about the Ottoman Empire was wrong.  They won in 2016 also.
68738	agent_1:I wonder if Reel Big Fish albums are clean?  They re-recorded them all after a dispute with their previous label agent_2:Interesting, maybe Walmart was involved. I don't think there needs to be a clean version for Bob Marley. He has been on the album chart for over 914 weeks! agent_1:That is pretty impressive!   Dark Side of the moon was still one of the best selling albums in 2014 even though it was released 40 years prior!	agent_2:Wow. It must be that good to be liked for so long. I wonder how good Radiohead is if their singer is credited with playing the laptop. Doesn't sound as classic as Pink Floyd.
157251	agent_1:I hate the Patriots but I have to give it to them, what a team, they are making history in the NFL agent_2:What do you think about Tom Brady? agent_1:I think he is a smart QB kind of ironic how he was bench QB in his high school team, I think thats funny	agent_2:It was funny indeed.  I'm sure his high school's QB is not even playing professionally anymore.
160125	agent_1:I think you're correct. Did you know that Alex Smith received his Bachelor's Degree in just a couple of years? agent_2:I did not know that, I've done this HIT so many times though I can tell you he took so many AP tests in high school he was a junior when he got to college. agent_1:That is amazing. Do you know in what year did Alex Smith became the first overall pick in the NFL draft?	agent_2:It was 2005, he's had a good career but the 49ers should have probably of drafted Aaron Rodgers.
137312	agent_2:No I would not say that Homer is a good role model. That show has been on forever and there is only one episode where Bart does not appear and is not mentioned.  agent_1:I prefer Thomas the Tank Engine. Nice, wholesome narrators like George Carlin, Ringo Starr, and Alec Baldwin. Good role models for toddlers... agent_2:I can't believe they have had such famous narrators. I wonder what draws them to that show?	agent_1:Ringo was illiterate as a child back in Britian because he was sick so much. I guess he wanted to help the next generation of readers. I don't know about the others. Hey, have you seen the UK version of That 70s Show? I heard it was awful...
109702	agent_2:Ooops I meant 2,699,990 its 6,000 square feet, you are right it would be hard to keep up it sounds like there is more land than house though, I may be able to manage... its only 4 bedroom six bathrooms. but I dont know the 2mill kills it for me I can find a better price. agent_1:You do get to use a Jack Nicklaus designed golf course! Do you golf? agent_2:True! and its 18 holes! not sure what that means but I do love a good game of tennis and a nice swim on the pool... I can see myself in it. Ill even invite you over! I dont golf, do you?	agent_1:I have only golfed once in my life. 18 holes means it is a full size golf course. Sometimes to save room there might only be 9 holes made which is only half the number of holes in a round.
126251	agent_2:That probably was not a good game to watch at all, very painful even to hear about. agent_1:Do you think ESPN should have won an emmy for the superimposed yellow first down line? agent_2:I don't see why not, people have won awards for much less impressive deeds.  It's become so associated with the sport while watching on tv, I would say it was deserved.	agent_1:It would seem that there are more winners and losers than just the team on the field.  ESPN and the NFL it self are money generating companies.  The talent like Benjarvus green-Ellis wins or looses.
85203	agent_1:I was just playing with my daughter last week. I heard Nick Cage convinced Johnny Depp to pursue acting while playing Monopoly.  agent_2:Nice!  The longest game of monopoly lasted 70 days!  Whoa! agent_1:I think I've played a few games that were close to that. Haha. 	agent_2:lol  Me too!  Every sweepstakes must legally have a free method of entry and that's why you can get free McDonalds monopoly pieces by mail!
59818	agent_1:Ok, I'll wait. agent_2:Maybe we are suppose to keep talking but normally its 10 chat turns agent_1:I have a DONE button here. I've never had it not appear after 10 turns. Odd.	agent_2:Have you pressed yours
154398	agent_1:It's worth it... I can't see Betsy Ross making that one.  Did you know Tom Brady is on his 6th championship ring? agent_2:I did know that. Hard to believe. I just learned Snoop Dog wrote a fight song for his son's high school FB team. agent_1:That's cool.  I hope he left out the expletives. I can't believe Brady has never eaten a strawberry?  What's up with that?	agent_2:I hope. Oh, that is weird! I have heard that only 2 NFL Superbowl's since 2002's championship game have not included either Tom Brady or Peyton Manning.
78123	agent_2:I think Blockbuster thought they could out do them, this was all before streaming was a thing. agent_1:Yeah you're right, they should have been prepared though, did you hear how Netflix was started? With the $40 late fee? agent_2:Yeah.  I need something to make my genius emerge so I can make a few million, or billion.  I wont be picky.	agent_1:Haha you just need a good idea, and yes it was Reed Hastings who is charged that $40 for turning Apollo 13 and late LOL what a good idea
124295	agent_2:Oh, good! Then I'll traipse right up to Mount Everest. They have a ramp for cars, right? I'm not climbing that thing agent_1:Haha agreed. Apparently only 7% of people read the terms when buying products and services on the internet. I don't really buy anything on the internet, but I don't really read the terms either haha. agent_2:I think I'm among the 7%. I'm a lawyer so I never want to be caught agreeing to a bad contract. It would be way too embarrassing! 	agent_1:True, I just feel like I don't engage in anything important enough to read the fine print.. HOWEVER, on the new yesterday a woman won $10,000 because she read the fine print. There was an email that instructed her to send an email to in the terms, and because of the email she won.
132240	agent_2:Yes, I think sharks in general are fascinating. I always watch tv shows about sharks whenever I can. They sem so smart and have been known to save people. They can be trained like dogs can so they are very smart. agent_1:Yeah, and apparently there have been records of them rescuing sailors, not only sailors. agent_2:Yes I heard about that. There are several species of sharks from small to as long as 40 feet long. That would be scary to come face to face with.	"agent_1:It would be cool to see the ""White Shark Cafe"", but only if I could be a figurative fly on the wall!"
131632	agent_1:Did you know that dumpsterfire is now an entry in Merriam Webster's Collegiated Dictionary? agent_2:Huh... That's weird. I remember when they first started including slang. Homer Simpson is in there with D'oh! agent_1:I guess when some words become viral to the point it become over used, it becomes qualified to be recognized with its own entry	agent_2:That would be my fantasy, to create a word in the dictionary.
155781	agent_2:That's true. I guess i've never played football. My best friend was a cheer leader though. It's funny that the Saints' cheerleaders cannot eat at the same restaurant as any NFL player and even have to leave agent_1:You know I've heard about that and I have to agree.  I think that is a very outdated rule.  If anything, they should make it where the second to arrive has to leave regardless of whether it's a player or cheerleader. agent_2:I agree!! Do you watch football? I hate the Patriots as a team but i do love game of thrones. It's funny that the author calls them the lannisters of the nfl. 	agent_1:I do watch foot ball and I too hate the Patriots.  I know Bill Belichick is the winningest coach in postseason but to me he is also the one that cheats the most.
7640	agent_1:I'm with George RR Martin on this issue. Fan fiction sucks. it is copyright violation. Someone should sue Julius Caesar! agent_2:haha yes! Maybe hercules can prove he is real by suing! I guess Edgar allen poe has the title for oldest example of a cyborg in fiction agent_1:Hercules never understood copyright law! Poe wasn't perfect, but he knew sci fi.	agent_2:haha I didn't know that, what did he do?
85445	agent_2:He was a mentor on American Idol last season, too. agent_1:Yes and hosts the most popular morning country show agent_2: Juan Pablo Di Pace will also be on dancing with the stars. He plays Kimmy's estranged husband on Fuller House. I find him kind of annoying on Fuller House.	agent_1:Maybe he will not annoy you as much when dancing... talking about comedy shows did you ever watch 3rd rock from the sun
81493	agent_2:He certainly was.  Jordan is my favorite player of all time.  Funny enough at one point Air Jordan's were banned in the NBA and Nike gladly kept paying the fines for Jordan wearing them! agent_1:Yeah, I suppose the fines were worth paying so they could have Michael Jordan advertise their sneakers. agent_2:Yes, it was a tremendous investment for Nike!  I once heard that the Air Jordan brand was worth more than the entire Adidas company!	agent_1:Basketball has always been my favorite and I grew up looking at Michael Jordan as a role model.  I can see why.  He is so powerful that a major corporation was able to get rich off him.
150477	agent_2:Yeah DO you know much about presidents? agent_1:Yes. Do you know who the three wealthiest are? agent_2:That is Jefferson, Washington and JFK	agent_1:Yeah. DO you know the name of the first president of Zimbabwe?
52372	agent_1:Exactly! Surprising that Jon Hamm also taught drama at his old high school and that one of his students was Ellie Kemper and Erin from the office. I like Ellie Kemper, I like her skits that she does on the Ellen Show, have you seen it? agent_2:No, I have never heard of her actually.  I do know the Office though, what character was she? agent_1:She played Erin Hannon on the office, she displays so much positivity and her bubbly personality can sure turn a frown upside down!	agent_2:Oh ok I know who you are talking about now.  I used to love watching that show every thursday night back in college.
143873	agent_2:I can see a female placekicker since the NFL has no rules forbidding women from playing agent_1:Yep I could see that too. Do you know any Engineers by the way? Apparently the average engineer will make more than the average NFL player over their entire lifetime agent_2:Can't say that I do but engineers also make more than MLB players on average too	agent_1:Yep you're right about that. I think it's really weird that the NFL uses tracking ships on the field too, I don't know how important it is to know the rotational speed of the ball
17771	agent_1:He's a lucky man! And a smart one for buying from what was an unknown company at the time that turned in to the powerhouse it is today. agent_2:did you know that the United States Postal Service has a contract with amazon to deliver packages on Sunday agent_1:I did know that and to me, it just says exactly how powerful amazon is.  As far as I know, they are the only company that has that contract.	agent_2:I think so.  I also saw that the workers for Amazons warehouse walk b/t 7 and 15 miles each dday
58229	agent_2:that is pretty cool. Same with Plato, he was a professional agent_1:Yeah that was before he became a famous philosopher agent_2:Yeah. Do you like watching TV?	agent_1:I love it. Do you ever watch the Simpsons?
157486	agent_2:Me too! I usually do great but always forget to get players off waivers and such. Like I pick the popular players but not so much the unknowns like Josh Allen (rookie) who had a monster year. Are you serious? for the spelling bee? agent_1:Yes it's easy to overlook those people. Yes for the spelling bee. It's amazing what they will do fantasy leagues for. Fantasy congress also exists.  agent_2:I love politics, I'll have to look into that one. Have you ever won? I came close last year with Russel Wilson, who is STILL under a major league contract.	agent_1:No, I also came closest last year. I was in first or second place all year and then it fell apart in the playoffs. Did you know that in the 60's top bowlers made more money than top football players?!
154673	agent_2:Yes, I heard that the top 3 US presidents were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson. agent_1:Yep you're right. I wonder why Trump is not in there unless Perhaps it is because we cannot estimate his wealth? On a different note though, why do you think the guest house is larger than the White House itself, that doesn't seem right agent_2:It probably is because they have a lot of people when visiting heads of government come to negotiate.  Their entourages are probably huge in number.	agent_1:Yes that could be true. It also could be true that the president of Indonesia released pop albums while in office haha I wonder how much money he made from those
41685	agent_2:Nice.  I'm going to have to look that up.  I think that's a good idea.  It's impossible to seperate 2 phonebooks that simply have thier pages overlapped together! agent_1:Lets talk about Children's Literature next. The government in Norway will buy 1000 copies of your book that you publish in Norway to distribute to libraries, 1500 if its a children's book.  agent_2:That's a great idea!  Dr. Seuss's editor bet him $50 that he couldn't write a childrens book in 50 words or less.  Do you know what book Dr. Seuss wrote to win the bet?	agent_1:I do not. I know that he did win the bet and released the book though. Which one was it?
78739	agent_2:I agree. Did you know Air Jordan's were banned in the NBA but Jordan still wore them and just paid a fine? agent_1:I must be nice to have that kind of money.  I respect that Tim Duncan who sacrificed money to play college.  Not many do that. agent_2:That's pretty nice. Do you like the Golden State Warriors?	agent_1:I wouldn't say I was a fan, but I admire any team that is a successful as them.
151663	agent_2:BIll knows the football like no one ever did. i expect that he could retire too and not have any regrets.  agent_1:Yeah I think he will go down as the best NFL coach of all time.  agent_2:he certainly deserves the recognition. he and tim brandy go together like peas and carrots i must say. anyway, great chat!	agent_1:Lol, yeah they sure have been together and winning forever it seems.  Same here, good talking, I hope you have a good night!
15738	agent_2:My children do not play soccer, but my son wrestles and my daughter has played baseball.  It's a good way to come together with other kids, like the like at the Total Soccer Area in Maryland-they would have loved to meet other kids like that.  agent_1:Do you watch the Academy Awards? agent_2:I do not, but am aware that they give out the Oscars.  Do you really think that Eminem has more oscars than Leonardo DiCaprio, Will Smith, George Lucas,  and Bill Murray?  I find that hard to believe.	agent_1:I find that very hard to believe. Daniel Day-Lewis is the only actor to win best actor at the Oscars 3 different times.
53528	agent_1:Yeah, several times. A lot to see. The White House is pretty cool. Ever been? agent_2:ya you asked me already, I have it was in middle school, I'm shocked there are twin buildings of the white house though, I'm going to ireland next summer i'll have to check out the one that is there agent_1:I wonder if it's a big as the real one. THink there's a duplicate in France too.	agent_2:yup you're right, have you ever been to nevada? apparently 86% of it is owned by the goverment
28452	agent_2:That agent_1:Lucas's ex wife Marcia Lucas won an academy award for editing the film while Lucas did not win for directing.  agent_2:Nice!  Sorry I hit the enter button before.  According to George Lucas, the entire Star Wars saga is told by R2D2, some hundred years after the return of the jedi.	agent_1:interesting. His ex wife won the award because she made many changes to the original film. the death of obi wan was one of them.
67557	agent_1:I tend to used youtube to watch original content like good mythical morning or learn knew things from the infographic channel agent_2:I totally get that. I used to live near the headquarters which are in San Bruno,CA. agent_1:Do you ever try to look up random facts about celebrities on youtube?	agent_2:I have really found some weird one like John Cena holds the record for wishes granted with make-a-wish foundation. What a wonderful guy who gives giving.
63499	agent_1:True. Hugh laurie is the highest paid actor ever for tv drama, earning $700,000 per episode in house agent_2:Wow and I wonder why Jim Carrey doesn't make dramas anymore because his belief system prevents him from playing in movies that don't project positivity. LoL agent_1:He's changed a lot. There is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free	agent_2:It's amazing the things that are online. To me, that shows my age huh? lol
124152	agent_2:that is interesting, he made so many scary movies, who would've thought that wouldve scared him! agent_1:i now and it is bambi, what is scary about that? agent_2:i know! the phineas and ferb show is voiced in part by the creator of the rocky picture show	agent_1:that is cool. if you watch a horror movie before visitng abstract art it is more enjoayble
39126	agent_2:Exactly, plus i wish i could see in the dark naturally like they can too lol agent_1:Haha I wish so too. Do you like dogs or cats more though? Apparently Google is a dog company LOL they prefer dogs agent_2:I love both, i have 4 cats and 3 dogs and you?	agent_1:One dog, but I like dogs more than cats, there's a reason that they are called
44959	agent_2:Do you like snakes? I see a fair number of them where I live. agent_1:Interesting. I had a ball python when I was younger.  agent_2:Sorry I didn't see your question about fish, btw. I've tried to keep goldfish as pets several times over the years. I had a pet corn snake once too. How big was your python?	agent_1:It wasn't that big. I kept bringing it to school so my parents made me get rid of it. It was an albino ball python. I could put it in my pocket. LOL
95774	agent_1:Indeed it is. I wonder if he ever entered the annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening to a novel. Isn't that a strange competition?!  agent_2:That is! I bet a lot of the material is hilarious! Although I find it unbelievable that romantic kissing is a recent development seldom mentioned in ancient Greek literature! agent_1:Indeed. Maybe writing about romantic kissing contributed to the growing distribution and proliferation of written works, culminating in electronic literature?	agent_2:Probably so! But what gets me is we're willing to read literature but only 7% of plus actually read the full terms before buying stuff online. No telling what we agree to without even knowing!
63096	agent_1:Maybe, I know Amazon warehouse worker walk between 7-15 miles a shift, that might not be healthy agent_2:I thought walking was very good for you? agent_1:Well not if you have to lift a bunch of weight and now have too many bathroom breaks like Amazon warehouse worker do	agent_2:LOL... yeah... that could be a problem for sure!!! LOL
134321	agent_2:that sounds like a great invention, have you ever been to Iceland? agent_1:I have not, I wish! agent_2:It looks like a nice place,  it doesnt have a rail service.	agent_1:Oh, so most people travel by air. In Japan I would avoid driving too as all highways are tolls. If you want to cross the country it costs $300
22380	"agent_2:Of course it would be punny like that. I wonder if there's a funny story behind why the New Zealand basketball team is also known as the ""tall blacks"" agent_1:Yes it's either a funny story or a sad story haha. Another sad story is that the creator of basketball was a losing coach for his university. Apparently the only one to haha how is that possible agent_2:It's possible that he was coaching a different sport and invented basketball as a way to redeem himself"	agent_1:Haha that's a good theory. Do you have a theory on why the dunk was banned from college basketball for over 10 years? From what I heard it was because Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was too good at it haha
59334	agent_1:lol! it was a show in the 90s that beat seinfeld one year at the golden globes agent_2:The fix was in then. There aint no way that Seinfield could lose that show. No WAY. agent_1:For sure, I think they won too many in a row it was time for another show to steal one year. It was funny from what I remember, but I don't know what it was about.	agent_2:I think it was something about space aliens and two FBI fellows that hunt them for profit and sport.
7101	agent_1:True many countries want to host despite no immediate economic benefits agent_2:That's really surprising, I heard there are no disceernable economic benefits to host the Olympics either. I guess the whole process is so taxing to the economy and people. agent_1:Perhaps but it also provides prestige, advertisement, tourism, and jobs so I guess it is worth it	agent_2:I like that some of the players are altruistic at least, even if sports is mostly about money. I heard a German player donated his 300,000 FIFA win money to help kids in Brazil get surgery.
75752	agent_2:Totally opposite of the band, Creed.four people thought a concert was so bad that they filed a lawsuit against them.  agent_1:iI recall that it happened in 2002. agent_2:well, I guess if nobody is wanting to hear you perform, you could always do like Pink Floyd...a concert with no people	agent_1:Yea but you probably have to do as they did it in a ancient roman amphitheater in pompeii.
162967	agent_2:I do not believe that. I read that he is also starting to edit history as other Communist leaders have done. agent_1:Yeah.  Omg Kim jong un was voted most sexiest man alive by the onion, china totally believes it. agent_2:I think  that is hilarious! I am surprised that Trump met with him regarding  nuclear bombs. Maybe that is a positive?	agent_1:Maybe.  north Korea is stalked with armory and ammunition.  Hope that meeting was a positive.
7202	agent_1:Yes, one of the privileges of modern life LOL. Our time on this earth is short, but our work day is not. agent_2:Correct. Did you see the new Wonder Woman movie?  agent_1:I havent seen it. but i have heard good things. i think that gal gadot is great casting. Anyway, great chat!	agent_2:Yeah, I haven't seen it either. Nice chatting with you!
151217	agent_1:It's pretty shocking. What is also shocking is there is only 11 minutes of live game play. agent_2:Ha! That is shocking. So then why do televised games seem to last so long? Like at least an hour and a half? agent_1:A lot of breaks, time outs, huddles, planning. Maybe that is why the lifetime engineer is higher than an average NFL player. They definitely work a lot more.	agent_2:I can only imagine. I guess only certain NFL players become popular enough to warrant multi-million dollar contracts. Probably mostly quarterbacks, as they're the leaders of the offensive teams.
81523	agent_2:I wonder how many pairs of shoes he went through while learning dance. I've heard that ballet dancers can go through a number of them quickly. agent_1:Sorry i don't know about it. Do you like Basketball? agent_2:Much more than dancing! Do you have a favorite team?	agent_1:Sorry, I don't know about it. Which is your favorite team?
127249	agent_2:The hoop is about twice the diameter of the ball. It's ten feet above the court. Maybe they should change some of the dimensions. agent_1:There are a some hoops that are double rim. There may be a trick to actually shooting into that hoop. agent_2:The granny shot is the optimal way to shoot free throws, yet few players use it because it looks completely stupid. 	agent_1:Maybe, Steph Curry used the Granny shot just for kicks. However, his 3-point shots are incredible.
12686	agent_1:Yeah. It's the world's game. The money is more than all 4 major sports in the us, combined! agent_2:that is crazy! what is weird is that greenland can't join FIFA because there isn't enough grass there for a soccer field! agent_1:That seems like it is limiting. What about turf. Why can't they play on turf, FIFA?	agent_2:ya I wonder if they require natural grass? I don't watch sports so I have no idea about the rules of soccer
127520	agent_2:I remember it,  my kids use to watch it.   agent_1:The show had great narrators, Alec Baldwin, Ringo Starr and also George Carlin.  agent_2:That awesome,  I never knew that!	agent_1:Yeah, did you like that 70s Show?
8793	agent_1:Are you a fan of pop music? agent_2:i do like pop music. You? agent_1:I love it, it became popular in the states around the 60s right?	agent_2:i guess? i dont know what the definition of pop music is. i figure there must have been stuff in the 50s too.
41992	agent_2:Would scare the kids. Apparently the kid from Shining didnt know he was in a horror film. agent_1:Interesting, I didn't know that. Is that the film with Jack N? agent_2:Yes, it is! Have you seen it?	agent_1:I don't think I have to be honest, is it any good?
122590	agent_2:I have not. Do you know it? agent_1:ya, mcdonald's invented it actually, they made it for the soldiers in uniforms agent_2:Wow that was nice of them. I wonder when the trunk came into existence?	agent_1:ya I don't know, but it sounds like a fire hazard to have a wooden trunk on a car back in the day
75375	"agent_1:That's true.  However, there is a team from Canada that is in the NBA. agent_2:Shooting ""granny style"" is the absolute technique to consistently score points on the line. agent_1:I've heard that!  I think that some scientists or something proved that it works best."	agent_2:Markkanen will break the three-point record by a 7-foot rookie in less than 42 games.
72717	agent_2:I see, do you like Tennis then? agent_1:No, I'm not a sports person at all. Are you a fan? agent_2:I am, my favorite player is Serena Williams, she is so talented, shes like the best female player ever in the history of the game	agent_1:I don't know anything about tennis, but even I know she's a phenomenon.
100267	"agent_1:Things certainly moved fast since then. I am shocked that you can equip your car with flamethrowers in South Africa to prevent carjacking! agent_2:That is scary! Does that mean cars are transformed to to have a ""launch"" button or maybe remotes so that when someone is trying to steal the car, they can launch the flamethrowers.  agent_1:I have no idea. It sounds like Mad Max ha ha. Did you know that McDonald's invented the drive-thru in 1975? I can't believe it's that new. "	agent_2:I enjoyed that movie but those desert climates seem ridiculously hot but good thing there was no lightning bolts since those are hotter than the surface of the sun! No, I didn't know they invented that, I use it very often.
128019	agent_2:Something interesting about presidents in the US, is that the wealthiests ones have been: Washington, Jefferson, and Kennedy agent_1:I saw that, maybe Trump will report his income tax so he can be concluded the wealthiest ever? agent_2:I do not think he will do it. But I can tell you that if you think the White house is large, the president's guest house is larger, that it crazy	agent_1:I know, crazy. I've never been, would be fun to go on a tour.
104909	agent_1:I havent known any of our recent ones speak any.  yeah i think he spoke french and german!  Not positive though.   agent_2:Maybe so! Can you also believe that Lincoln was the first president to be photographed at his inauguration and ironically, John Wilkes Booth was also in the photo? Weird, huh? agent_1:Damn,  Lincoln got photo bombed!  and by his assassinator,  creepy. 	agent_2:That is creepy, isn't it? So how would you feel if we implemented a law like Guatemala that didn't allow close relatives of former presidents to ever run as president?
114942	agent_1:What do you think about Kevin Durant? Do you think that the media really hates him? agent_2:I think thats just excuses, I dont really like him as a player, if you dont win dont blame the world about it agent_1:Yeah I think it's an excuse to. He should just concentrate on playing good basketball. I also didn't know that the Warriors have won the past two NBA titles	agent_2:He did win the award of MVP both times but the team has a lot of talented players,
114475	agent_2:I believe that she makes a lot of money, she is on TV every single day. It is hilarious.  agent_1:Yes.  I love that Ethiopia has a celebrity chef who believes he can combat hunger by encouraging diverse eating agent_2:That is very interesting, I've never heard of Jenna Marble the youtube celebrity, but apparently she makes $346,827 from it. 	agent_1:Wow.  I knew youtube can pay some people a lot for ads!
91982	agent_1:do you like music? agent_2:I love it. Do you have a favorite singer? agent_1:I love the band Linkin Park and you?	agent_2:Me too actually and they have the best selling album of the century
37043	agent_2:It was good!.. do you like the rotten tomatoes ratings? agent_1:I rely on rotten tomatoes heavily. Although, sometimes they get it wrong. Michael Bay only has a 38% average. agent_2:yes it is subjective!! for example those movies that are based on video games are not really liked!	agent_1:The netflix movies always score high. Nice chatting with you!
40588	"agent_1:Yes seriously. Must be very confusing and hectic at dog blood drives too! agent_2:Especially when the dogs don't understand. Hopefully the ""donors"" are dogs that are normally calm and not easily upset. agent_1:Agreed. Stray dogs have it pretty good in Istanbul because there are vending machines there that release food and water!"	agent_2:That's really great. I always feel bad for animals that are abandoned.
126913	agent_2:I know right,  what a huge missed opportunity from Myspace!   agent_1:In Canada kickball is also called soccer-baseball , thats a weird name for a sport agent_2:Heres an interesting one :Facebook is primarily blue because mark zuckerburg suffers from red-green colorblindness	agent_1:That is weird and this one is kind of interesting too.I have heard that Baseball is a really popular sport in Japan
121324	agent_2:President Bush was still alive when his surgeon was killed.  He spoke highly of his doctor.  Speaking about presidents, do you know that jfk, washington and jefferson were the top three wealthiest presidents? agent_1:I heard that too, that President Bush was very saddened. Really? Wow, you would think President Trump would be the wealthiest! agent_2:I thought so too (re. Trump) but an article stated otherwise.	agent_1:That's just strange lol. So do you usually vote during the presidential elections? I always do.
62533	agent_1:I agree.  It didnt start out too good on it's opening weekend netting just 36 million dollars but it has done very well since. agent_2:Amazing statistics, and the fact that they paid the Rock $20 million - I'm sure they were nervous after that soft opening! agent_1:They paid him alot considering they only had a budget of 91 million.	agent_2:It certainly seems of balanced - make me wonder what the other actors were paid.  Like Kevin Heart and Jack Black?
146443	agent_2:oh yes i know that. i want to know more about this beautiful game. do you know the circular huddle used in todays american footballs was created by paul d. hubbard, a deaf quarterback. so the other team could not read his hand signals agent_1:That fact is very fascinating to know, and it is very effective while the game is playing agent_2:yes I know that so true. I really hope you watch a Eli manning game one day, he is a genius	agent_1:nice chatting with you.  Have a happy holiday
107247	agent_2:I have not but I might seek it out later because it sounds very interesting. Apparently George RR Martin despises fan fiction but to be fair he takes so long to get a new book out that fans have to do something to entertain themselves.  agent_1:Classic elitists attitude. I'm trying to find the site that has radio dramas you can listen to for free. agent_2:Apparently they exist. At one time they were the height of entertainment but I do not know if they would hold up now. 	agent_1:I like the old radio dramas, I think they were the original podcasts. Jim Carrey refuses to do dramas, due to his belief system that prevents him from doing anything that doesn't project positivity. Yet, he's married to someone who I personally don't think embodies that value.
133557	agent_1:Oh yeah I would have to agree with you on that.  Do you know much about past presidents? agent_2:I know that Trump isnt among the wealthiest. agent_1:Yeah I think I read that he isn't in the top 3.  Do you know which ones are?	agent_2:JFK, Jefferson and Washington.
47860	agent_1:do you like drama? agent_2:I sure do. Do you like Jon Hamm? agent_1:I sure do, he is so funny. Have you ever seen House MD?	agent_2:I have seen some episodes. Hamm used to be a drama teacher in a high school
76508	agent_2:I wouldn't do that alone either. I just learned this and thought it was smart.  During the age of discovery, ships released rabbits onto islands to provide a future food source for other travelers agent_1:Yeah thats interesting.  Mackinac island, mi has banned motorized vehicles for over a hundred years. most travel by horse-drawn carriages or bikes. agent_2:the stone age. High-heeled shoes were originally worn by persian cavalry soldiers, perhaps as early as the 9th century. that sounds super uncomfortable 	agent_1:Really?  persian soliders lol that seems weird. The first king to travel around the world was king kalakaua of hawaii
59139	agent_1:Smooth! Somebody built a working 16 bit computer using minecraft building blocks. I'd like to have seen it. agent_2:Space ships only use a 16 bit computer when they fly into space! agent_1:Good one! If we viewed earth's history as a 24 hr block, human's existence would be equal to one minute.	agent_2:The hudson bay region of canada has been found to have less gravity than the rest of the earth.
101151	agent_1:regular CDs ? oh wow. Did You realized that vinyl cds are coming back ? You don't like those ? agent_2:I used to have a collection of those but I gave them to my friend when I had to move. agent_1:oh ok :) Do You know Linking Park band ?	agent_2:It was my daughter's favorite then but I enjoyed listening to their songs too.
51014	"agent_1:No, I have not. 13 years before the movie ""Incredibles II"" came out, there was a sequel to the first Incredibles that exists in a video game form, and is called ""The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer"" I guess people just couldn't wait. For marketing, it's better to strike while the iron is hot. agent_2:I wonder if the Incredibles video game was as well reviewed as the movies agent_1:Good to know! The present day events of the Incredibles are set in the 1960s. That's a great period for clothing and architecture. "	agent_2:I heard Edna Mode was voiced by director Brad Bird, that's interesting
137378	agent_1:I can see that. I feel saddened about it because I trust no one on the internet. I always assume my data will be breached too. agent_2:yup you have to apparently, do you ever look yourself up online? I guess that is called egosurfing agent_1:I have. Mine isn't about ego but what people are saying about me as a public figure.	agent_2:ah interesting, have you ever been to finland? I guess everyone there has a constitutional right to internet service
50046	agent_1:Hamilton is a big one. Museums are also awesome agent_2:What museums would you recommend? agent_1:The National Building Museum has become a big favorite. As well as the National Museum of Natural History	agent_2:Those sound good. Is it easy to get around DC to visit these places? What about food?
11494	agent_2:However, they do sell returned and like new items with discounts agent_1:I didn't realize Jeff Bezos built a clock into a mountain that will run for 10,000 years. I doubt humans will even be around by then! agent_2:You never know, we'd probably be exploring space by then! Jeff Bezos also owns Blue Origin, a space company. It was actually founded before SpaceX was!	agent_1:The plan to sell a robot assistant for only $250.
82359	agent_2:I bet his team mates were really angry at him or maybe not Babe Ruth is one of the biggest legends of the sport.  agent_1:Yeah, and the Ottoman Empire was also still in existence back when the chicago cubs last won the world cup. agent_2:That was a really long time ago, curious thing but the womans World Cup had higher ratings than the World Series in the US.	agent_1:I wonder why they have higher television ratings. Most people prefer to watch men's sports.
84643	agent_2:I am! I am interested in the planets. agent_1:Me too.  Did you know that five planets in our system can be seen with the naked eye? agent_2:That is crazy! Have you heard about Jupiter's moon ganymede?	agent_1:No what about it?
142108	agent_2:Yea, the wealthiest are JFK, Washington, and Jefferson, I guess rich people have better things to do than be president agent_1:Right, Don't tell trump though, lol. You know there is a President named President Banana?  agent_2:Yea, from Zimbabwe, I wonder if it's because President Banana liked bananas or not	agent_1:To funny! Did you know that there use to be a rule that the runner up was automatically the VP?
55630	agent_2:Wow - that's fast! Looks like it was a person named Anne Jones.  agent_1:Yea, that's pretty crazy!  agent_2:In the 18th century, there was a moral panic because of the spread of reading of novels lol	agent_1:Ha, now that's pretty funny too. Would you watch or read a story that was based on that and plays out like a zombie/anarchy society survival thing?
39886	agent_2:Yeah, having a competitive advantage in the Olympics is not a good thing.  i bet its used more in local and national competitions though. agent_1:Yes.  I love how it was the Native Americans who taught the British how to do the crawl when they beat them in a competition where the British only did the breaststroke. agent_2:I bet they could swim very fast.  Not as fast as that new Dutch commuter bus though that can travel at speeds up to 160 mph!	agent_1:That is crazy speed for a bus!  I would be worried about a crash.  Of course that is completely different than Mackinac island, where there are no motorized vehicles at all!
95320	agent_2:what do You mean ? agent_1:More money is usually placed with male dominated sports. agent_2:I guess, that's not the case... where is money, there are achievements ;)	agent_1:I guess.  Out of all the things I've heard about Michael Jackson I had no idea he had a patented device used to help him lean for dance moves.
27348	agent_1:I wonder why they consider it a biohazard agent_2:Maybe its their way of fighting tobacco use? agent_1:I would like to see the computer built with just blocks from minecraft.	agent_2:How is that even done?!?!?  I thought that was just a video game.  It is like game inception, a game with in a game.
126577	agent_1:When there is a disputed border, google maps tailors its maps to the claims of each country where the internet browser is located agent_2:That's bizarre. Google headquarters is in Mountain View, California.  agent_1:Google maps calculates traffic by tracking how fast android devices are moving on the road	agent_2:I didn't know google is now a conglomerate called Alphabet.
147214	agent_2:They were the first team to ever beat the packers. agent_1:Well that definitely says something.  What happened to them? agent_2:Don't know.  They were a 1919 team.	agent_1:Too bad they didn't stay around.  Well, it's time for me to go.  It's been nice chatting with you!  Have a great day!
88313	agent_1:Yes, I do. Draymond porbably was shooting his mouth off. The league is trying to remain respectable so that it doesn't lose fans. He should be careful too so that he doesn't lose endorsements. agent_2:Exactly, you just can't argue while playing a game because like Draymond did with Kevin Durant, you are going to lose some fans. agent_1:I'm astonished that Allen Iverson has a lifetime endorsement contract. He gets a monster payout when he's 55. 	agent_2:Wow, that's awesome. I guess this argument was considered one of the worst ever and intense in the Warriors era,
86671	agent_1:Yeah, she is a bit of a chameleon when she was campaigning. I think it's interesting that she did a lecture with Steven Hawking. agent_2:Interesting.The top three wealthiest presidents in american history were jfk, washington, and jefferson. agent_1:I'm actually surprised that JFK was one of the richest presidents. The again there was a president in Zimbabwe called President Banana so I shouldn't be surprised.	agent_2:That's funny. The Kennedy family is still very rich.
47478	agent_1:Yeah! I agree 100% that's not entertainment! It's completely cruel and terrible! Music is a much better form of entertainment. So many instruments, sounds and great genres!  agent_2:Yes, I agree. Do you watch sports for entertainment too? agent_1:Is MMA considered a sport? Oooh is martial arts considered entertainment? Yeah. I think boxing counts too. I really like Mixed Martial Arts. And I've had a few friends that played soccer, but that's about it. Oh my dad loved football when I was growing up and I'd watch although I had no idea what was going on. Haha!	agent_2:Haha, I have trouble following along in football. Anyway, what do you think about a type of soccer where three teams face each other at the same time? Seems confusing!
104655	agent_1:Ha ha no. In exchange for recycled plastic bottles it releases food and water for strays.  agent_2:I guess if i needed food and water, i know what to do. the dogs will help me, im sure. agent_1:I'm sure they will. Did you also know that elephants and dogs are the only animals to understand pointing?	agent_2:I have never had to teach my pet elephant to point, but now that i know, it will come in handy.
115284	agent_1:Good point, more people... Sounds like a frivolous thing to me.  As for people with mental health issues, we need to be more proactive... This guy gave plenty of clues, concerning videos, locked up 5 times... agent_2:Yes, our justice system has a few loopholes in it I would say. ARRESTED: Michael Hunt, for aggravated stalking & attempted kidnapping w/a weapon.  Clearly something more should be done about people like him. agent_1:Yeah, the cops did a good job once they got a tip but there should be some kind of database where they wouldn't need a tip.  It's the same way with these school shooters. Oh well, hard to do without creating a police state.	agent_2:Yes, every viable solution seems to have its big drawbacks, doesn't it?  If you are a celebrity and in the spot light, you have to put up with a lot and Lana Del Rey is certainly no exception to that rule.
113564	agent_1:Do you listen to classical music at all? agent_2:I love classical music when i get a chance to listen to it. One of the most popular radio acts of the 1930s was a ventriloquist. agent_1:Same here. I listen to free stuff on the internet and stream other music through Facebook.	agent_2:Facebook grew into a monster.  Facebook held its initial public offering (IPO) in February 2012, valuing the company at $104 billion, the largest valuation to date for a newly listed public company.
52940	agent_2:Tell me about it! It's worth looking into for sure! It's just so hard to believe its initial IPO was valued at  $104 billion which was also the largest valuation for a newly listed company! agent_1:I think that FB will be the last big social media website. People are already closing accounts. I think people are worried about how it affects their lives. agent_2:That is so true. I honestly like going on there to watch dance videos. Speaking of dancing, did you know Bruce Lee actually won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship back in 1958?	agent_1:The man was a legend. Probably had a great sense of rhythm too. I would love to see footage of him dancing.
143532	agent_2:Hmm I am not sure actually, I bet there is a fun story there maybe? agent_1:Yeah it is pretty neat. McDonald's started them and it was because soldiers were not allowed to get out of the cars in their uniform agent_2:Oh that is pretty neat. Did you know it is illegal to warm up your car in Ohio?	agent_1:What? That is crazy. In South Africa you are allowed to put flame throwers in your car to protect it
5415	agent_2:They might need him agent_1:He's good but not as good as Aaron Judge though agent_2:Hopefully Aaron Judge will not be out for more than 3 weeks	agent_1:Yea, he's the face of the franchise now since Jeter left
7280	agent_2:Hi, I think it is fun to learn about. I don't understand why the managers can also be players. That is sort of odd. agent_1:that must date back to the day when one of the players was chosen to manage as well. like an onfield boss or leader. agent_2:Oh okay, that makes more sense for sure. The rules can be outdated sometimes, I think. I remember a story about a man who found old baseball cards in his grandpas attic. Being outdated is a good thing then.	agent_1:yes, those old cards would be worth a lot to someone. i would sell some of them and keep the rest as an investment.
31314	agent_2:The Ballad of Reading Gaols is a legacy, I like that poem, its based on his life on prison agent_1:Ill have to check that one out.  I really liked his works. agent_2:He had great compositions and still has many fans to the day, there is a $12000 fine for kissing his tomb	agent_1:I wonder what the obsession is with doing that?
67291	agent_2:Chase the Abominable Snowman or Yeti?  Curious... Do you read the full terms when you buy something over the internet?  agent_1:Sometimes try to skim over it but usually not agent_2:I too am part of the 93% that doesn't read them.  Only 7% of people do...	agent_1:Considering how many people use the internet, it is a good thing we have a back up copy
164679	agent_1:No way! That's a lot!  It even says that if they are already eating there and a football player walks in, they are required to leave.  Seems strange. agent_2:For sure.  I like football, but also chess too.  Do you play?  I think it would be interesting to see the 3 player chess game. agent_1:I actually have never played.  I did see though that there are more possible moves in a game of chess than there are atoms in the known universe.  Do you think thats true?	agent_2:I find that hard to believe.  I've been playing since I was a kid, but don't play too often anymore.  I never knew that each pawn used to have it's own name.
61260	agent_2:Yeah I think social media is good because people can add what they want and are able to see everything that everyone has to offer to help.  agent_1:Right. This will get awareness and create a local group to watch out for each other. If others are around, a group can be intimidating. Maybe an attention getting sound could bring in the troops. agent_2:That is a really good idea, loud sounds or something like that could work well. 	agent_1:Most women cannot defend themselves, I'm afraid. Now, if I had my Wonder Woman attitude, maybe I could shake them up. Ha.
136386	agent_2:I wonder if they are any good. The guest house is bigger than the white house? I haven't seen the guest house, have you? agent_1:I haven't and actually didn't know there was a guest house. Weird! But I guess it isn't as surprising as knowing presidential runner ups after elections automatically became vice president before 1805. agent_2:Can you imagine Trump and HiIlary trying to pass legislation?	agent_1:Ha! I couldn't imagine that! But stranger things have happened. Like Roosevelt banning Christmas trees from the White House as he was a conservationist.
7555	agent_2:That's odd, he wasn't a Democrat, interesting. i didn't know that. agent_1:Very interesting I think. 15% of the tea party movement identify themselves as democrats. agent_2:Interesting! I was watching a vlog on Youtube who was talking about how many people are not Democrats or Republicans. I agree in that because I don't identify as either.	agent_1:Did you know Fox News threatened to sue the Simpsons one time?
120290	agent_2:Very true. Harry Truman road the Dumbo ride at Disneyland, but would let them photograph him.lol agent_1:Teddy Roosevelt formed the Bull moose party after being rejected by the Reps.  He did not win but some of his ideas did get elected. agent_2:Really, interesting. I assumed they always used red and blue colors consistently, not since 2000! Good chat!!	agent_1:Yes the colors are a new thing!
25163	agent_1:A huge security risk or maybe not considering how backwards it is and no one has access to those things except the government, I suppose. agent_2:That's true, it may be pretty smart on their part. Did you know it took the secret service 4 days to determine the White House had been struck by bullets on November 11, 2011? agent_1:That's crazy! I wonder why it took them that long to do that, but then again, a man in France impersonated to be a government official and managed to sell the Eiffel Tower twice! Who were the buyers?!	agent_2:I know, wonder how they missed the bullets whizzing around? Amazing, they could get away with selling the tower, not once but twice!
51657	agent_2:It is an enjoyable genre. Lol. Do you like Bill murray. agent_1:I am a Bill Murray fan, my favorite movie is Ghostbusters agent_2:That one is ok I guess. I liked groundhog day. 	agent_1:That was pretty good, his small role in Zombieland was also great.
121039	agent_2:I love the Cleveland Indians because I'm from that region. agent_1:I love the Cincinnati Reds because I'm from that area lol. Looks like we are both in Ohio.  agent_2:lol  I actually saw the Reds back in the late 80s and early 90s at the old Riverfront stadium.  I was going to college in Columbus and we drive down there for Reds games!	agent_1:Very cool. I used to love Riverfront stadium. Did you know baseball managers wear uniforms because they can technically play if needed?
75923	agent_1:I'm great! Do you use Facebook? agent_2:I do use facebook but not as much as I used too, too much data breaching. Do you use it? agent_1:Never used it. I thought it was a time suck. Then I found out about privacy violation and knew that I had made the right choice. I think it's funny that Burger King had a promotion for unfriending people. I wonder how many people took up the challenge.	agent_2:Some people have thousands of followers so I am sure they  had some. I only have like 100 friends so I did not have many to loose! Just kidding, I am particular about who I let in my life...
75562	agent_1:Thats the area code of New York right? agent_2:Yea, makes sense the largest city would have the easiest area code to dial agent_1:It is the largest city so I guess its fair, crazy how the cables that carry the internet and phone across the sea are only 2.7 inches in diameter	agent_2:Yea, so is being impossible to separate 2 phone books with overlapping pages, looks like I got to hit the gym
106532	agent_1:It is only available in the states so I am assuming they may use spotify for when he travels internationally. agent_2:Pandora has a negative worth. I would expect them to be positive with a revenue of 274 million. agent_1:Taylor Swift pulled her music from spotify because music shouldn't be free but has it on pandora? Hmmm...	agent_2:Given that pandora captures the essence of music, I would think taylor would want her music played there.
31735	agent_2:I did see an article to that fact and can't imagine how that must have felt for them to do so. I mean what a great way to spend a birthday, making a album as well as setting a record at the same time for age and doing what they set out to do; pretty cool!! agent_1:For sure! I wonder if anyone would do that again. Were you into NWA much? agent_2:I am sure somewhere, someone has a goal to surpass the twins! I am not really into NWA much but have listened a time or two. I find it a little bit funny that McDonald's has paid rappers five dollars for every time a big mac is referenced in a song.	agent_1:No way, that can add up lol. I think I should make a song saying big mac like 1000 times. It will help buy a new car
136390	agent_2:He started the national park and forest service! Bush installed solar panels! agent_1:Heck, I can't believe it took the secret service four days to notice bullets hit the White House on November 11th back in 2011! agent_2:Good help is hard to find, like that bullet!	agent_1:Speaking of the White House, did you know it actually has twin buildings in both France and Ireland! Crazy, Isn't it?
102590	agent_1:It depends on how long they were doing it.  Computers have not been around forever.  Speaking of pay, a man found $3 million of baseball cards in his grand-father's attic. agent_2:Wow, what luck. I would sell some and keep the rest for appreciation. Until I needed more money. agent_1:I would sell it all and diversify.  I have been burned by having too much in one asset.  Canada calls kickball soccer-baseball.	agent_2:Canada has got to be different, I guess. They have hockey. That's enough for 'em.
146552	agent_1:Yea Eli has won 2 super bowls and was a first round draft pick, he had a great career agent_2:Don't stay past your time. Leave while you're on top. Enjoy the feeling of being a winner. agent_1:Yea, he's not playing as good as the fourth round pick of the same draft Philip Rivers currently	agent_2:Well, that's his cue. Time to take a bow, and exit left.
13215	agent_1:That would be really cool to see in Iraq, I've been there but didn't see anything biblical lol. It was a pretty cool place though, unfortunately it's been so destroyed by war. agent_2:Really that's interesting!! Scary place now! lol the Star trek door sound is just a piece of paper being removed from an envelope. agent_1:I just had to reenact that sound just now lol, it would be hard to come up with those effects back in 1966 when it started! Did you like the show?	agent_2:I watched when I was a little girl on TV. Ahead of its time for sure!!
65299	agent_2:I cannot even imagine that.  I have heard that some galaxies are getting pulled outside of our own universe - are there multiple universes? agent_1:Some people think it might be just one giant hologram! Eek! agent_2:Or that there is only 1 electron in the entire universe!	agent_1:Hopefully our galaxy doesn't get pulled away and absorbed or something. Though that would go well with the theory that universes evolve through natural selection.
85091	agent_1:What hobbies do you enjoy? agent_2:I enjoy bird watching, you? agent_1:I enjoy a wide range of hobbies such as listening to concerts, but I am curious to learn more about bird watching. Could you tell me more?	agent_2:yeah, it is really cool, we try to find them in the area whether by spotting them or listening to their sound and then classify the sound
77176	agent_1:is there really a copy? how could you make a copy of the whole internet? it seems impossible. agent_2:Yeah I don't know enough about the Internet to answer that question. But do you know those terms that you see when buying a product or service on the Internet? Only 7% of people read that. agent_1:i am not one of the 7percent. i am surprised that it is that high.	agent_2:Yes me too. Do you like horror films? I like watching them around Halloween. Maybe that explains why I lose the weight around that time because watching horror movies can burn up to 180 cal.
143945	agent_2:she was great! a very funny lady and the perfect choice for sesame street. I haven't seen her in a while.  agent_1:I have not either - Judge Judy just came on tv - did you know she makes $123k per episode? agent_2:i am not surprised at all. she knows her value to a tv audience and to the advertisers. she gets paid fairly.	agent_1:Yes only Lebron James gets paid more than her.
145440	"agent_2:Really? That's fascinating. I had no idea that radio waves could travel so far!  agent_1:I know, I didn't either! And soldiers have been able to pick up radio signals with makeshift ""foxhole radios"" so when you think of it radio is something that has probably always existed and been able to be interacted with. agent_2:Very interesting. Today when radio is mentioned people always think of music rather than dramas or communication. Did you know that Canadian radio requires 40% of their music to be Canadian?"	agent_1:I didn't but that is very fun!
138898	agent_1:Yes, even with all this land out in the country.  Lol I read somewhere that dogs can't see as many different colors as humans, but that they are not color blind, as alot of people believe. agent_2:Their sense of smell is quite keen too. Some dogs in Moscow have learned to use the subway. I bet they figured out a lot from their sense of sight to do that. agent_1:That's incredible.  My lab has a great sense of smell, she sniffs so hard, it sounds like a vacuum cleaner.  When people first hear her doing it they are kind of scared, it's so loud.  But, she's done it since she was a puppy.	agent_2:Dogs have 'eureka moments' and enjoy the experience of solving a problem in order to obtain a reward. Have you ever witnessed a eureka moment in your dogs?
112336	agent_1:Seems a little ecentric but he's worth billions so maybe he wanted the world to know the time... agent_2:Who knows. I think at a certain point that sheer amount of obscene wealth starts to affect how you view the world.  agent_1:He's going through a divorce so it will only be half of that so like 150 billion. That just doesn't go as far any more...	agent_2:I could survive on that for a while I think lol
21955	agent_1:A hornets fan huh. I liked the heat when I was a kid. I liked that crossover Tim Hardaway did. Until Allen Iverson came to the league then he was my favorite. agent_2:Heck yeah Tim Hardaway was awesome, I remember watching him on the Warriors.  Iverson was awesome too, he got the best of my team back in 2001, but, I think we will be back there this year.  agent_1:I haven't really followed it much this year. Are they doing pretty well.	agent_2:Yeah the Bucks, they are first place in the whole league, I really hope we can make the finals, I have never seen it in my lifetime.
5447	agent_2:So a manager can play?  I didn't know that.  If we are talking about the same man he found old baseball cards, right? agent_1:Yeah he found card that belonged to his grand father, they were just hidden in the attic, crazy luck right! agent_2:Definitely!  Those cards had been hidden away since the 1940s!  I guess the people living there either never went in the attic or never looked around.	agent_1:So you said you liked baseball so maybe like the Yankees? what are your thought on the team
94840	agent_1:Yeah, although Swift did not think it was so swift!   But Kanye is impetuous. He once gave his mic to a wheelchair-bound fan at one of his concerts.  He folows his heart. agent_2:I guess he does, he is a random star, you know that Swift is actually taller than Kanye, by like 2 inches agent_1:With or without high heals?  Well, some celebrities are random and others are solid. Take Carol Burnett. She was much beloved, never a whiff of scandal, and she even took the time out to do the first celebrity cameo on Sesame Street!  	agent_2:Im guessing without heels, but I would have to look that out, Carol Burnett was great I loved her in Sesame Street.
37866	"agent_1:I can't imagine it either! But I think he could have done it, he's supremely talented. I think when he performed ""Who Says You Can't Go Home"" it went Number 1 on the country charts. agent_2:I also can't believe he played shows for Hillary. agent_1:Ahah that's fair, I'd hope he did. After all I don't think he made any political comments to insult her, and even if he made political comments I'm sure she'd agree with them, he is pals with Obama after all."	"agent_2:Yeah, I'm having to rethink him.  I guess he's a NJ boy so it kind of makes sense. Wow, OK has a state rock song.  It's ""Do You Realize"" by the Flaming Lips?!"
127487	agent_1:Well I was surprised to learn that Henry ford supported the spread of country music over his fear of jazz agent_2:Yeah isn't that a very crazy fact, I would never of thought that.  Did you know there are also only 2 african americans in the country music hall of fame? agent_1:I wonder if that was due to talent or prejudice?	agent_2:Yeah that is a good question, I don't know enough about the history of country music to have a decent opinion.
117759	agent_2:Some things are flat out humorous about them. They actually used the same gavel for 165 years until Nixon broke it. agent_1:Yea, it's pretty funny a sergeant at arms actually carried a senator into the chamber agent_2:He must have really not wanted to be there haha. They definitely have their share of fun, I hear there's literally a drawer full of candy, and it's a long standing tradition.	agent_1:I wish my job had a candy drawer like they do in the Senate
136893	agent_2:That is very fast. All of Japan's highways are tolls and it would cost roughly $300 to cross the country. agent_1:They better have the most perfect roads if they are charging people that much! Where is the coolest place you've been? agent_2:I've been to Iraq during the war....not sure I would call that a great place. What about you?	agent_1:I've been to Italy, that's about it, what branch were you? I was in the Air Force!
48855	agent_1:Same with Demetri Martin except for he dropped out of Harvard Law agent_2:WOw. Have you heard of Bromantic Comedies? agent_1:Yeah movies like Hangover right?	agent_2:Yes and the Harold and Kumar. They are pretty good.
118567	agent_1:yes. Basketball is a team sports which have five members in each team. agent_2:Yep. The New Zealand basketball team was nicknamed the tall blacks. agent_1:The highest paid state employee is either a college football or basketball coach. It shows their are so many fans for it. Teenager are very eager for it.	agent_2:That's crazy. Well, it was nice talking to you!
20821	agent_2:Well we have a couple hundred peoples worth at my house then.  agent_1:LOL.  Has your son started reading? Iti is described as a complex interaction so be patient. if he's just starting :) agent_2:He doesnt read by himself yet just looks at the pictures. He is still young. Maybe one day he will break the speed reading record of 4700 words per minute. Thats reading pretty fast. Lol.	agent_1:I always wonder about how well these speed readers do in terms of reading comprehension.
13988	agent_2:I do Did you know 20th century fox did now think it would be popular? agent_1:Yes they were convinced it would fail originally agent_2:Yeah so they sold the rights to George Lucas for half a million	agent_1:Nice. Did you know his wife won an Oscar for editing of the film?
117403	agent_1:Interesting that the 70's show was remade verbatim in the UK.  agent_2:Yeah,  but I didnt know England even had the 1970s... I guess that is why it was canceled after only 10 episodes. agent_1:I was unaware that it was on over there as well. It was sort of better for the U.S. 	agent_2:I don't recall ever seeing the Queen wearing bell bottoms... My hat's off to them for trying! Like the nod given by the crew of the Simpsons to the South Park crew for airing a Family Guy finale episode! Gotta respect that!
5477	agent_2:I don't think so in soccer.  Many of the men have long hair.  Remember Alexi Lalas with the long hair?  Speaking of baseball, did you know a female pitched was once booted from MLB for striking out Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig? agent_1:You're right!  A lot of them tie their hair back.  I didn't know that.  How interesting!  It's been fun chatting with you! agent_2:Same here! I didn't know there was a female pitcher to Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig.  Have a good evening!	agent_1:I'm going to have to look that up.  You have a good evening too!
73836	agent_2:Ok so their names are Larry Page and Sergey Brin and they founded the company back in 1998 agent_1:I heard about Larry Page but I had never heard about Sergey Brin before.  I wonder why he is so low key.  He has a large voting power though. agent_2:Maybe he just likes living a private life or isnt a part of Google anymore, you know new employees at googles are called nooglers.	agent_1:I did not know that.  Why are they called nooglers?
143164	agent_1:Hello agent_2:Good morning.  Do you watch the Emmy's? agent_1:No, not normally.  Were they good?	agent_2:I don't know.  I didn't watch either.  I just always find their picks to be rather lame.
7258	agent_2:what abt Target? agent_1:My wife likes to shop at Target. I'm not a huge fan. I think they have expensive products. agent_2:yah i m also think that way.. 	agent_1:I agree. I saw Best Buy and Target will price match Amazon.
73905	agent_2:That is good to hear.  Women can be superheros too, and they need to know that! agent_1:If you ever get out from under your rock do you get to watch much television? agent_2:Lots of Netflix.  So I can catch some of these movies there too!	agent_1:I love having Netflix for my television option, I can pick what I want to watch and when.  I don't have to wait weekly for the next broadcast.
69250	agent_2:Seems like it happened around from 2000 to around 2010. agent_1:Yeah, but I don't miss the analog era of TV. Now we have so much better tv shows, like Westworld do you watch it ? agent_2:I've never seen it. What is it about?	agent_1:It is about robots created for a western-themed amusement park. It is quite complex.
58524	agent_1:Cool, it is for a special reason? Jeff even built a clock on a mountain agent_2:Yes it is to be used for kindle and similar devices? A clock? agent_1:Yes and it is supposed to run for 10 000 years	agent_2:Hmm interesting, good for him I guess. Did you know they have the patent to 1-click buying?
3592	agent_1:Oh I see. Some of them can be cool though, like that poem that when read normally is depressing and vice versa agent_2:there is a 274 line poem called the chaos, i am assuming becaus it has irregularly pronounced words agent_1:I would assume so too. THe Javanese alphabet too, if recited in order it forms a poem	agent_2:the vikings were warrior poets. lol what the heck? did they just shout poetry at the enemy ?
133782	agent_2:Woah, that seems like a really physically demanding sport, I need to start playing hockey and lose some weight lol agent_1:lol  Me too!  There was a hockey player who was once traded for $1 and went on to win 4 Stanley cups.  I'm going to have to look his name up. agent_2:I wonder why they traded him at such a cheap cost, I guess they didnt see potential in the playe	agent_1:I know.  I'm wondering if the team that traded him just wanted to get out of paying his contract.  They might have had financial issues.
51027	agent_2:Jack Black is pretty funny but he's no Monty Python, I don't think they will name any programing languages after him agent_1:Good thing he wasn't on Comedy Central. Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 shows  He would have no career. agent_2:Its astonishing that Comedy Central has cancelled so many shows since being founded in 1989	agent_1:I don't understand either. Maybe it has worked for them though. Anyway, I enjoyed chatting with you! Have a good day!
15978	agent_2:I would like to know. We can;t be the only planet to have harbored life. Why are we so special? It can't just be coincidence. I mean if humans are but a minute if earth history was put into 24 hours, who are we to judge what's in the history of other planets. We barely know this one. agent_1:Exactly.  We're just a speck out there.  Unfortunately I'll never see it.  Just great to see all the research continuing. agent_2:Me either. I can only read about it and imagine. But at least them my imagination plays a part, and it's quite interesting. What if we have a mirror planet around another sun somewhere. Another planet being destroyed by humans. Well, my imagination just got sad. Dang.	agent_1:I've always thought along those lines too. Guess I'll go out tonight and look up at the stars!!  Great chatting with you and a great subject.
23041	agent_2:That's really awesome for exclamation mark did you hear how George Lucas became a billionaire by the way agent_1:Yes the studio thought the movie would be a flop so they gave him merchandising rights!  He was smart! agent_2:He was really smart! Speaking of Star Wars and outer space, what do you think about the planet Earth?	agent_1:I am worried about it with global warming.  We could move to Venus but I think I would miss the change of seasons there
137759	agent_1:Isn't that funny how we do that! ESPN won an academy award for football too! agent_2:ESPN is the sports network yes? they cannot win an award for drama or comedy i think. agent_1:Yes they are! sometimes I think it is a comedy with all their analysts lol. Do you watch basketball at least?	agent_2:i try to watch when i can. it is a fast flowing game. i enjoy the energy. tix are expensive though.
124	"agent_2:I agree!  The Marvel cinematic universe takes place in earth -199999, a multiverse different from the original comic book multiverse, earth-616! agent_1:That's pretty wild. Marvel published a ""generic comic book,"" in order to trademark the names ""superhero"" and ""super-villain."" That was pretty smart of them.  agent_2:No doubt!  Do you know much about the planets or the universe?"	agent_1:I know a little bit. I've heard that Venus does not tilt.
110909	agent_2:I wonder if you send a birth annoucement to one of the replica White Houses if you will get a congrats card back...just like the real white house does agent_1:Maybe. That is really neat that they still do that. They used to do it for weddings too.  agent_2:The only US President with a PHD was Woodrow Wilson.  I guess most of them have law degrees instead	agent_1:I think we could do with a few more teachers and a few less lawyers running things. At least we don't have a pop star in office though.
71011	agent_2:Yeah. Do you know how wide are the phone cables? agent_1:Yes they are actually only 2. 7 inches wide, that is it	agent_2:Yeah and they sit on the bottom of the ocean floor
134981	agent_1:Yes it was just the runner up that moved into that position agent_2:Yeah. Did you know the president of Indonesia is a pop star? agent_1:Yes and he has released 3 albums already while in office	agent_2:Yeah. Did you know there are white houses in France and Ireland too?
139510	agent_2:Yeah, I used to have the mail service too, but USPS is too unreliable. They would lose DVDs and then I would get blamed for their lack of return.  Streaming in much better. agent_1:Then there was the late fees! agent_2:Remember the old dinosaur, Blockbuster? Hard to believe they had a chance to buy Netflix and balked...	agent_1:Only 50 million too, compared to 2 billion worth
163617	agent_2:Yes after the French explorer who founded Detroit. agent_1:yeah antoine de la moth agent_2:You can put flamethrowers on your car in South Africa!	agent_1:wow, way to go for them. nice chat
93141	agent_1:Nice. Do you know who the three wealthiest presidents in the us are? agent_2:I have no idea, who is it in order? agent_1:It is Jefferson, Washington and JFK	agent_2:Oh wow nice. IN Guatemale the relatives of the president cannot run for the position
42875	agent_2:That sounds like a love/hate relationship you have with Lebron? agent_1:Always has been since he killed us by going to Miami for 3 years. You can always see right through Lebron James. He wants to do the right thing, but screws up doing it most of the time. agent_2:Ok, I understand.  Being that you're from Cleveland, did you ever attend any of his high school games?	agent_1:No, though I live about 10 miles away from where Lebron James went to school. He's a good story, and will be for a few more years. Good talkiin' with you this early morning....have a Great day!
26575	agent_1:Did you know that 5 planets in the Solar System are visible to naked eye? agent_2:that is really cool. Did you know that there is a planet that orbits around four stars agent_1:No. WhatÂ´s the name of that planet?	agent_2:It was discovered by scientists in 2013 but I don't know what they call it exactly
157989	agent_2:Yeah the drive thru was a great invention,  to think it was created for soldiers and now everyone can enjoy it.  agent_1:Yep that was really nice of McDonald's to do that. Do you know the story behind the trunk of your car? agent_2:Has something to do with when people use to carrying around trunks. Those things were ridiculously heavy,  I cant imagine traveling with trunks lol 	agent_1:LOL yep it was wooden trunks. They would put them on the back of cars. And I guess the name just stuck
95863	agent_1:I encountered them a lot doing puzzles in the newspaper. They always seemed to be printed next to them, so I couldn't help but read through them. It always seemed like they manufactured a crazy conflict in a family. agent_2:That's pretty cool. Did you know there are 12 different blood types that a dog may have?  agent_1:I did not know that. I do know that a lot of veterinarians keep an office dog or cat to always have an emergency blood donor on hand.	agent_2:Oh wow I didn't know that either. It says dogs can donate blood at dog blood drives too.
72241	agent_1:Oh absolutely, it's very sad. It's nicer to see when celebrities can do good instead. Ethiopia has a celebrity chef who tries to combat hunger problems by encouraging the consumption of diverse foods. agent_2:I hope that works.  Wealth is easy to acquire when one gets $123,000 per episode like Judge Judy.  She is entertaining as long as you are not the one receiving her sharp comments. agent_1:Oh I'm sure, I'd hate to be on the other end of that. I wonder if she was one of the celebrities to visit Pixar's secret room.	agent_2:Could be.  I began my career at the telephone company.  AT&T used to own a ship that laid the 2.7 inch diameter cables on the ocean floor.
29582	agent_1:I guess the flare and fame of the guitarist makes it worth it. I just hope it wasn't a rare or limited edition guitar. agent_2:Right! Me too. Actually Aerosmith made more money off of guitar hero than any album they ever recorded...that is crazy! Their career has been spectacular. agent_1:Many guitarist are very unique and have spectacular careers. For instance, Brian may uses coins instead of picks, while Pink floyd guitarist turned a houseboat into a floating recording studio	agent_2:Wow, thta is really interesting! Crazy! I didn't know that there was a guitar that was  so small it was the size of a red blood cell, and played by a laser! I can't imagine that!
42702	agent_1:For sure, power to the people I'd say! What do you think of Earth? agent_2:3rd planet from the Sun is the best place to live agent_1:That is what I heard lol. Unfortunately that same planet has had 80% of their forest destroyed	agent_2:4.5 billiion years old and we already killed 80% so bad
146515	agent_2:I didn't but I did know of his brother Peyton and there is one other brother Cooper. agent_1:And they are/were all QB's? They must love the game. agent_2:I found out that Cooper had to quit football before his college career due to spinal stenosis. Who knows how great he could have been.	agent_1:Wow, they actually changed the speed limits on some roads at Ole Miss campus to honor Archie and Eli.
100177	agent_1:Yeah, the secret service is full with skilled staff, its suprising to know they missed the bullets that struck the White House back in 2011 agent_2:i wonder about that too , for four entire days agent_1:Its a long time, I  bet someone got fired that day lol. 	agent_2:haha i bet too. nice chat
86225	agent_1:I just thought it was one of few programming language names I know and it shares its name with a musical pitch. agent_2:I'm not sure.  But I do know that Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts. agent_1:That is really neat!  I love how Jazz has also become world wide.	agent_2:Even a Harlem woman has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every Sunday for the last 20 years.
23525	agent_1:Good morning!  Do you listen to country music? agent_2:Yes. Country music is also know as country and western music. It take root from genres from  Folk music. agent_1:I like that alot of the songs use stringed instruments like guitars and fiddles.	agent_2:Guitar is a musical instrument that has six strings which is played by plucking the strings. There are so many guitars.
96229	agent_2:probably the radio.How about You agent_1:I actually only listen through albums. I never really used the radio agent_2:Did you know there are storms on Jupiter that can be picked up by AM radio due to the strength of the storm?	agent_1:I wonder what kinds of sounds you can pick up. I wonder if a foxhole radio could pick up Jupiter's storm as well
17538	agent_1:Yeah, probably for the best, they likely would have ruined it. LOL agent_2:Facebook;s minimum age to join is 13 for the most part but variations and local law sometimes effect that also.  agent_1:Interesting, I didn't know that they have a minimum. Is that for the US? Nice chatting with you. 	agent_2:Zuckerburg suffers from red-green colorblindness that is why Facebook is mostly blue, nice chatting with you also
71490	agent_2:Hi! Hope you're doing well!  I am a huge fan of Natalie Portman! But I am surprised that she was upstaged by Raffey Cassidy in Vox Lux. I've never even heard of the young actress! What about you? agent_1:I've never heard of her either, I'm sure she's got to be good to upstage Natalie Portman. Very cool. What is Vox Lux? Is it a movie? agent_2:It is an R rated film that I've heard is disappointing. Unfortunately, they say it doesn't really have the energy to say anything interesting or really anything that makes sense, which is disappointing! 	agent_1:For sure for sure. You listen to a lot of music by chance too? Either in person at a concert or download and buy albums?
9751	agent_2:That sure is crazy and yes, I do vote. DO you? Astronauts are so cool, they vote from space agent_1:Every vote counts lol  agent_2:It sure does. In the UK not all men were able to vote until 1918	agent_1:Thats weird.  I wonder why that was.  Did you know the us sante used the same gavel for 165 years!
1220	agent_2:I was just reading that.  How cool is that? I like to watch some of the stuff on Netflix. agent_1:I also like to watch movies on Netflix. Its convenient and the premium is not too high agent_2:Exactly, Spykids received a 93% fresh rating on rotten tomatoes, better than, say, lincoln or the dark knight rises.	agent_1:true that. How about soundtracks. Any thoughts on that?
6121	agent_2:No, basically they;re legless lizards without limbs. agent_1:oh, ok. The fear of snakes is hard-wired  in human brains. i guess that makes sense. we needed it for evolution. agent_2:Yeah, can you believe that crocodiles are more closely related to birds than to snakes.	agent_1:i guess scales and feathers are analogous? i never know they were related. Anyway, great chat!
68959	agent_2:Patrick Stewart was in the movie Xmen, among other movies. No, I have never heard of Hugh Laurie. agent_1:Hugh Laurie sounds vaguely familiar to me though I don't know who he is exactly. He must be pretty good if he earns $700,000 per episode. agent_2:That is insane money!  I don't watch soap operas, but i know they got their name because they were sponsored by soap manufactures in the past.	agent_1:Do you like Jim Carrey? He is a little too silly for me
14676	agent_1:Sure. There are lots of competition out there. I enjoy watching a lot of comedies they have on Netflix. I think there is a Demetri Martin comedy special available on Netflix now. He is awesome. He dropped out of law school out of boredom to start his career in comedy. agent_2:I might have to watch that one, Im going to search it in the IMDb data base agent_1:That's a good place to find out info!  The Shawshank Redemption is a highly rated movie on IMDB, which was not initially recognized in the theaters.	agent_2:I really enjoyed that movie, so good, the plot, the actors, just wonderful, its actually my favorite all time movie
28177	agent_1:Its actually a funny story. He entered a steve martin look a like contest and won it. Lol. agent_2:That's a great way to get into the entertainment business for sure! Do you know what the e stands for in chuck e cheese? agent_1:Is it entertainment? Lol.	agent_2:It is! haha. Did you watch the academy awards at all this year?
41192	"agent_1:It is. Nothing like race to bring 2 complete strangers together in a chat! agent_2:Well, most people put on their trousers one leg at a time, regardless of race. I think that it's odd that a judge sued a dry cleaners for $67 mill. What was he thinking? agent_1:""Where's my pants?"" Just a guess... How special do your pants have to be though??? Seems like overkill."	agent_2:I think he was trying to scare the dry cleaners. Maybe it was his favorite pair of saggy pants. All the justices are wearing those nowadays.
118244	agent_2:Yea, it's already too expensive despite air travel being 10% slower than it was in the 60s agent_1:Yeah, hate flying as well.  You know what's crazy... Iceland has no public rail service so anyone there without cars uses domestic flights between towns. Crazy. agent_2:That's crazy, I wonder if Iceland have many rabbits? Sailors would release them as a future food source on newly discovered islands	agent_1:That's kind morbid but smart too.  Think I might have read something like that on Facebook.
153804	agent_2:I love Montery, CA. A beautiful place with great mid temperatures all year round. agent_1:Really. Where is that in CA? In Napa Valley? agent_2:No, closer to San Jose on the West Coast. Around Carmel.	agent_1:Nice. Have you ever been to Mackinac Island?
91574	agent_1:That is a lot!  Especially since it lasts until he is 55 and then he gets a 32 million lump sum agent_2:Yep I agree he's not going to have to worry about money haha. Have you ever shot a basketball granny style by the way agent_1:That is the only way I can make a basket!  Would love to see a NBA player do it but they will not because it looks stupid	agent_2:If it were me and I were going to make $800,000 a year like Allen Iverson though I would definitely do that LOL
159123	agent_1:That is crazy to think about, I love the first 10 seasons.  I guess there is also one episode where Bart doesn't make any kind of appearance.  agent_2:ya I think I heard of that, he makes no appearance and isn't mentioned, I wonder if they just forgot about him haha agent_1:Yeah that's funny to think about, it's probably in a later season as well.  	agent_2:have you seen the show shark tank? apparently most deals that they make are not actually enacted in real life, that seems like a let down because that means the show is basically staged
71507	agent_1:Are you a dog person? agent_2:I like dogs. I have never had one. You? agent_1:I am a dog person and apparently Google is with us, they like dogs as well and they are a dog company	agent_2:Google has the right idea. Dogs are great companions, perfect for an office. they help lower stress
75078	agent_2:I love Amazon. Are you a prime member? I am. agent_1:i was a prime member. it was good when i was ordering a lot of stuff. i watched some videos too. agent_2:Did you know Jeff Bezos built a clock into a mountain side that can run for 10,000 years?	agent_1:why did he do that? does he want a clock around for when he gets older? I bet he has a secret to immortality.
113166	agent_1:yeah, that makes sense. i wonder how good they are. im glad they are making stuff, but quality matters. agent_2:True.  You know, they have people working for them that just watch the content on the site and tag it. agent_1:i guess that job seems pretty cool, but i bet it gets boring after a while. watching tv all day could get mind numbing.	agent_2:It really could, especially if like you said, you had to watch some low quality shows.  Still, it's got to be an easy job too mind numbing or not.
100895	agent_2:I read that too! Seems like a lot of wasted game time. Who's your favorite team? agent_1:Out of the 32 teams my favorite is the Pittsburgh Steelers because my family comes from the central part of the state. agent_2:That's a good team. I cannot believe there are only 4 major sports in North America.	agent_1:Yes. I'm surprised that we haven't seen a female NFL player yet since there's no written rule against them playing.  I figured maybe a kicker or punter would have been a good fit.
132092	agent_2:Yeah. We need them but we don't need the massive trade deficit. It's beyond my pay grade.   agent_1:The Chinese have bought a lot of US debt. That is a problem. They have too much power. We should stop them. agent_2:Yeah.  Then there's N. Korea making it even more complex.  It seems most don't want to rock the boat. 	agent_1:The Korean problems should be dealt with too. I figure that Trump needs to put those people in their place and not meddle with the likes of us, the USA.
93937	agent_2:Is that the same as survival of the fittest. I believe that one.  agent_1:I guess it makes the most sense. There are also some start in the universe that are cold enough for us to touch them  agent_2:Wow thats interesting. I heard there is a cold spot in the cosmic microwave that has been theorized to be a link to a parrellel universe.	agent_1:the universe is full of mystery. nice chatting with you.
96443	agent_2:Yea I don't like the music they play but at least I don't live in Canada where the law requires the stations to play 40% canadian music agent_1:the govt wants to protect the local bands. everyone knows Rush and Neil Young. but what about the internet? the govt cant control that. agent_2:Nope, they can't stop you from making a radio with a razorblade and pencil diode either like the WWII soldiers made	agent_1:that sounds impossible, but i guess the soldiers found a clever way to make it work.
86487	agent_1:Do you like sports agent_2:I only like basketball. Do you like any sports? agent_1:I like most sports from basketball to football	agent_2:What is your favorite basketball team?
50063	agent_2:Same here. I think that sometimes we as a people spend too much time on entertainment.  agent_1:I'm forever chasing my son away from his game console.  It's not Nintendo anymore, now its Xbox. agent_2:I remember having the old school nintendos where you had to blow on the cartridges and it was just basic colors and graphics. 	agent_1:I had an Atari back in the day, I had to save forever to but those games.  Now you just down load them in a matter of minutes.
27833	agent_1:I do remember watching him play!    Can't believe they banned that shot for almost a decade! agent_2:That is pretty nuts, do you prefer FIBA or the olympics? agent_1:I would have to say the Olympics.  What is FIBA?	agent_2:It's the like the World Cup for basketball. It is every 4 years opposite that of the olympics. It is pretty fun to watch.
32790	agent_2:That could be one of the reasons, I watched a documentary on planet earth the other day, our planet is just amazing agent_1:Yes, it is, I agree. So many amazing things our Earth does. I think its amazing that the Earth is only the third planet from the Sun. agent_2:The third planet but the only one with intelligent life, at least in our solar system, we will also be helium free by the end of this century	agent_1:That will change a lot of birthday parties! It's crazy that the day was only 5.5 hours when Earth was first formed.
17790	agent_2:Was that the one where the daughter had a pink themed party? agent_1:Yes it was.  .  They had pink flowers, pink cakes, pink couches, etc agent_2:That's really crazy. I saw that they had a carnival ride and a pink themed splashed party room.	agent_1:switching topics, did you know that in Nevada, the US government owns 86% of the land.
70811	agent_2:Hey, I'm good, thanks. How is your day? I know just general information. Did you read something interesting about the sun recently? agent_1:The sun is our friendly yellow friend in the sky. Actually, the sun is write, but the atmosphere shifts the color of light that reaches us. agent_2:Yes, and the sun is also huge. It's over 10 times of size of Earth. However, human will never travel on the sun... It's just impossible lol	agent_1:I guess we'll just have to admire it from afar. Still, our sun is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star discovered in our galaxy. It is a modestly sized sun. Nothing excessive.
139246	agent_1:I have not heard of that. Is it good? Should I put it in my recommendation list? agent_2:It's ok, I like finance stories for some reason. Were you aware that they tried to remake a That 70s show in the UK, but it failed?  agent_1:Isn't that similar to Friends but Friends was way more successful than the 70s Show?	agent_2:Yeah, pretty much. They are all kind of the same if you ask me.
10211	agent_1:No I have not yet but I am watching it next week with friends. How about you? It rose to fame tso quickly agent_2:I haven't seen it yet either.  I heard it's good and that Bradley Cooper directed it as well as stars in it. agent_1:Yeah there is a lot of buzz. And then you have Lady Gaga on the other hand, they seem to make a great duo.	agent_2:That's what I've heard.  They say she is not as good an actress as she is a singer but due to editing the movie makes the most of her singing.
104535	agent_1:No, I am not sure, I have lived in washington dc and maryland, seen the white house many times, but never the guest house. agent_2:what do you think about the pres. of indonesia releasing pop albums? Do you think Trump should make an album with Kanye? haha agent_1:HAhaha, It wouldn't surprise me if he does, that will be entertaining and will blow youtube up.	agent_2:haha maybe the royalties from it would bump him into the top 3 wealthiest presidents haha
47643	agent_2:It's crazy that those cables are so thin. 2.7 inches! also crazy there is no wireless replacement. Recently the lines were cut in Fiji and they had no internet or cell service. agent_1:Unicef will donate clean water to a child that needs it for every minute that you do not use your cell phone.  I do not see the relationship - perhaps you know.  Is it to do with environment? agent_2:Unicef usually does work with children. Not sure how they keep track of that though, it would be tough. Tough like keeping track of migrating birds. Are you interesting in birds / birder?	agent_1:I do.  Apparently hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to build or repair their own nests.
105581	"agent_1:Despite being released over 40 years ago, the dark side of the moon was still one of the best-selling albums of 2014. agent_2:That is a great album.  I new NWA's ""Straight Out Of Compton"" was platinum, but I didn't know it was the first to do so without airplay or a major tour. agent_1:Awesome, I did not know that either. Reel big fish re-recorded all of their hits for a best of album after losing the rights to their old record label."	agent_2:I don't know them.  Going back to golf, I found out the hole/cup is 4.25 inches in diameter.
69501	"agent_1:Tripping? I have three dogs and I find it hard to believe. agent_2:I found that number to be a little high, too. I do accidentally trip over my dogs, because they are often underfoot. But, I also used to work for an emergency department, and I don't remember too many ""tripped over dog"" chief complaints.  agent_1:naah, it's sounds made up. My chocolate English lab is in the same color as my floor, but I've never actually tripped over him... I kicked him couple of times by accident, but nothing more ;)"	"agent_2:Do you apologize to your dog when you accidentally trip over him? I do. I even find myself saying ""excuse me"" sometimes to my dogs! LOL!"
111475	agent_2:Wow now that's hot! Did you know that the three horizontal lines on menu apps and websites is called the hamburger button? agent_1:The name kinda makes you hungry huh agent_2:Indeed. Apparently constant clicking on links can cause a real measurable addiction in the brain. 	agent_1:I can understand why it is a serious concern.
123158	agent_1:That is awesome. They also own IMDB. Do you have a FireTV stick? agent_2:No firestick.  Jeff is going to lose a boat load of money in the divorce though. agent_1:I'll bet!  I hope Amazon does not suffer.	agent_2:It won't.  It was good chatting with you.
120751	agent_1:Nice.  I think all the songs they did with Jay z were amazing!  My favorite LP song was Numb.  agent_2:Nice!Despite being released over 40 years ago, the dark side of the moon was still one of the best-selling albums of 2014. agent_1:That is very impressive!  Who still buys it I wonder?  Like people who just lost their copy? lol 	agent_2:HA! I do not know if you know football, but that's like Tom Brady being in the top 5 in jersey sales. He's been in the league for 17 years. How can you not have a jersey by now?
564	agent_1:lol I watch the women though because the pitchers really sling that ball to the plate.  On May 11, 1991 Creighton hosted Utah in the longest softball game in NCAA history lasting 31 innings! agent_2:Yeah, that underhand pitch can really move. That is one long game! Not much of a career after college though. As of 2014, the average salary for a professional softball player is between $5,000 and $6,000. agent_1:No.  Not enough fans to support it. lol  Jose Canseco claims to hold the record for longest softball homerun at 622 feet.  He might have it.  I've watched him hitting softballs on youtube.  He crushes them even still to this day.	agent_2:He had the juice to hit the balls a country mile. I didnt know he played softball.
137419	agent_1:I am surprised that it's even that many. I figured it would be 1% or something. agent_2:Same here.  I definitely dont read them.   agent_1:I figure that they can't take my soul or my first child, whichever is worth more.	agent_2:I might have promised  a few companies my soul.  I figure they can fight over it if it is that important to them.  LOL
135349	agent_2:That would be epic. Bush, Obama, and Trump should release a joint album. Bill Clinton could play saxophone on it! agent_1:haha that is an awesome idea! I would definitely buy that album, imagine how epic that would be and how it could potentially bring everyone together agent_2:I think it would, at least it would show that Democrats and Republicans can work together. 	agent_1:Yes I agree, I saw that in the old days the runner up would become the vice president, so we could have had vice president hillary clinton, man that would have caused more drama haha
123233	agent_1:Because the terms can vary from vendor to vendor, I stick to a few sites I trust rather than buy from anyone on the internet with the best price.  Use to, you could shop on the internet tax-free.  Those days are gone with Amazon and others collecting sales taxes online.  Some of the things the government waste our tax dollars on are ridiculous, like a study of shrimp on a treadmill!!!  Yet, every now and then they do something good like Norway donating 1 billion to save the Amazon rainforest. agent_2:Yea it seems like every week research is contradicting itself. But one thing we should all agree on is saving the environment like Norway. That is so amazing. The government needs to focus more resources on that for sure.  agent_1:Even nonprofits are challenging us to do more.  Did you know UNICEF has a program where they donate a day of clean water for every minute you don't use your cell phone?  I wonder how they figure that out?	agent_2:Yeah that is also a great initiative. I think that is a positive note to end on! It was great talking with you have a great day!
5186	agent_2:I have been to both stadiums. I suppose I am one of the numbers that support the Yankees having the second highest attendance. agent_1:Are you a Mets fan too?  I know they are not as popular as the Yankees but they have a big following too agent_2:I am definitely a bigger fan of the Mets. I like underdog stories. I never knew in 1974 they shared Shea Stadium with the Mets.	agent_1:I think the Jets and Giants played at Shea at some point to.  Lots of work for the groundskeepers
164990	agent_2:I hope not! The first president of Zimbabwe was called President Banana, and based on the little I've read about him it seems like he wasn't a very effective leader and the country is still negatively impacted by his time in office.  agent_1:So enough politics and more entertainment, did you ever own a nintendo system? agent_2:I did a long time ago, and SNES, too. Too bad they stopped making those consoles.	agent_1:Yeah they stopped making them back in 2003, its a shame but theres more advanced systems now
54760	"agent_1:I find it super hilarious, you know there are some funny names in the NHL, Greg Fisher, Docile Coyote..makes me think they changed their names to get popular with supporters agent_2:That's a good theory and probably true. Many sports names are Animal names, and its pretty awesome to know there are about 20 quintillion individual animals on earth. that's alot. agent_1:yea I bet everything gives itself a balance in the ""multiverse"" maybe in a different part of the multiverse I would be called mr. froggy"	agent_2:Haha, that's a good one. How about the two high school students that rode their horses to school on 'no vehicles to school day', unfortunately got suspended, but ha that's a good one.
68551	agent_2:wow that's a lot. In Croatia they still use a roman amphitheater as a concert venue.  agent_1:That sounds amazing. I would love to see that. On a similar note, in 1972, pink floyd recorded a live concert at the ancient roman amphitheater in pompeii...with no audience. agent_2:wow that's awesome. Creed fans sued them over a bad concert 	agent_1:Well to be fair I would imagine every Creed concert is a bad concert. They knew what they were getting into ha ha.
124594	agent_2:Same here!  She has a unique style of acting!   agent_1:Yeah she does for sure, and most of the movies that she is in are pretty good too so that helps.  agent_2:did you know a man in france successfully sold the eiffel tower twice!!!!!  Crazy!!!	agent_1:Wow, have they ever done a movie about that.  I'm sure that person is super interesting even past doing that. Well it was nice talking with you today, I hope you have a good night.
102141	agent_2:Yeah, I guess Google needed to create that mode. I know that when Audi cars went to India they had to create a more aggressive horn to withstand how much they use it there.  agent_1:I wonder what that sounds like? I never new that Detroit was founded by a French man who invented the Cadillac.  agent_2:Oh, hmm, thats neat. I heard a cool story about a man in New york who bought a property and then found tons of classic cars. The barn on his property was loaded full of them.	agent_1:Why can't stuff like that happen to me? Did you know that the drive thur was not created until the mid 70's?
147005	agent_1:Weren't they called the Fairies? that is a funny name for a football team! agent_2:It strikes fear into their opponent's hearts. LIke the Iowa locker room! agent_1:Yes wasn't it painted Pink or something? I bet people are confused when they see it!	agent_2:Yeah. I find their ownership weird too. The community owns them?
78334	agent_2:Yes, I like to go to those I know of better than going to the unknown. I can understand why some people are hesitant. agent_1:Yes I agree. I like to make sure that I stay at a nice hotel. There are many pet peeves that guests have. agent_2:I know, I can understand alot of them.  Nothing worse than loud noise when you need sleep!	agent_1:Yes that can be very annoying. One of the biggest reasons guests get offended is unattentive parents.
80755	agent_2:That's what they say, doing something new brings happiness. lol agent_1:I think I may try something new then! I have tried using chopsticks with sushi and it only brought me humiliation. I am not good with chopsticks. agent_2:lol, I know you have to enjoy it if your trying something new! Doing something different with water is interesting. But, lapping it up like a cat doesn't sound fun. 	agent_1:Although if I walked in on you lapping up water like a cat, that would bring a ton of fun to me. I would loose it!
140938	"agent_2:A lot of older people I know seem to think it's making people dumber. I recently saw a magazine with a cover that said ""Is Google Making People Stupid?"" agent_1:I dont know if it makes people stupid,  definitely makes people lazy.  agent_2:New things always seem to scare people. During the 19th century when chess was becoming extremely popular Scientific American worried that it was robbing peoples minds of valuable time better spent elsewhere."	agent_1:have you watche Black Mirror on Netflix?  Its about the future and technology,  but with a dark spin.
86117	"agent_2:That's crazy! I can't believe that! Another funny random fact is that the New Zealand basketball team nickname is the ""tall blacks""  agent_1:That would never fly in the US. People would be rioting over a name like that. agent_2:Right? They definitely would. Seems like a lot of people are rioting over the Wizards playing against the Bulls and their loss. "	agent_1:I don't watch too much basketball. Mainly just college. Never really got into the NBA.
103519	agent_1:Yes, and not only the music but his moves made what he did unique, he had a kind of provocative way to perform and that was what many loved too. agent_2:I'm not a fan of his moves, looking back I'm sure it was unique for the time but all that gyrating and showmanship could be a little much!  Just my opinion! agent_1:And his hair was unique too. He dyed it black!	agent_2:I wonder why he did that?  I've never seen pictures of him with blonde hair! I would be interested in seeing them.
122476	agent_1:I know right?  Fashion aficionados look for collar gaps in clothes to tell you get your clothes tailored or not.  They would laugh at my clothes.   agent_2:Oh wow,  I wonder why that is important to know. agent_1:I'm guessing because they probably know a lot about it. It's been fun chatting with you!	agent_2:Greatt chat,  thanks!
84209	agent_2:I haven't. I listen to mostly rock music. A hanson song became a most requested track on a chicago alt-rock radio station because djs did not reveal the band. agent_1:Hanson?  Wow, that brings back some memories.  Mmmm, bop!  lol agent_2:Haha. Yeah, I didn't realize they were still around! Did you know The irish prime minister visits washington to meet with the us president every st. patrick's day? Seems like he would have better things to do that day. 	agent_1:I did not know that. It would seem as though there are more important reasons to visit U.S than that.
17854	agent_2:he has been quite generous off the court. he donated money to help kids go to college too. agent_1:Nice. Maybe he uses some of that $90 milion he got from Nike to do some good in the world? agent_2:yeah, a lot of the players dont do that. they blow their money and often end up broke after they retire. it is sad.	agent_1:It is. And then, before too long, the appear before Judge Judy, the second hiohest paid celebrity, behind LeBron, and get to tell their sad stories to the world.
83334	agent_2:Hello - I went to college and got a degree so I do. What about you? agent_1:Me too, I enjoyed it. Did your parents give you a to do list when you went?  agent_2:They did not. I didn't go to college until I was 22 because I was in the military. 	agent_1:I didn't go until later either, so my parent didn't give me a to do list. Did you know in South Africa it is legal to equip your car with a flame thrower?
50984	agent_2:It was tough.  It survived my son. Funny, Bill Nye got his start in a contest to look like Steve Martin.  He won... agent_1:I see the resemblance. I enjoyed the show when it was on. agent_2:Do you like to visit D.C. There's this playwright named Aaron Posner that's looking for ideas on what to do there with his 6-year-old daughter.	agent_1:I do. It's a great place to visit. I wonder what he found to do.
5845	agent_1:Yeah, that's what I thought ! Maybe it's worth googling it after this HIT ;) agent_2:Yes, did you know what type of clothing were made by Apple? agent_1:That's the thing - I don't , but I would think it's something artificial - maybe worth looking into ; 	agent_2:What do you think about a man wore 70 items of clothing at a Chinese airport to avoid bagging charge?
112401	agent_1:Absolutely!  I have been doing business with Amazon almost as long as it has been around back in 1994. agent_2:Very good. Bezos build a clock into a mountain that can run for 10,000 years. agent_1:Nice. Is that to keep their shipments on time?  They use USPS on Sundays and they could use all the help they can get!	agent_2:I love the shipments on Sunday's. I wonder if those workers get overtime for that?
149021	agent_2:Not really haven't heard any of his music. Isn't he with Riahna? agent_1:You mean dating? No they are not dating. Did you hear the song Hotline Bling? agent_2:I have not heard any of his music. I know he was born Aubrey Drake Graham in October of 1986.	agent_1:He was. Well that song is actually sampled from a 1972 hot titled Why Can't We Live Together.
155871	agent_2:That would have been nice to find. Hidden since 1940 that is so historic.  agent_1:I couldn't imagine what ones were in that collection. That's about as cool as one married couple scheduling all the baseball games until 2005. agent_2:Yeah that is extreme! Soccer baseball is what Canadians call kickball. Kind of makes sense.	agent_1:That makes total sense! Well have a good one!
146899	agent_2:That's true. The fact that they've survived this long is definitely impressive. Especially when people hate them so much agent_1:True enough. It seems like they'd be the ones hunted out to extinction or near extinction instead of whales. agent_2:That's true. Although they used to hunt whales for their rib bones and sharks don't have any! Maybe that's how they survived	agent_1:Could be at that.
62863	agent_1:That is pretty impressive. Did you know that in September of 2010, the UN appointed an official ambassador to Extraterrestrials in the case they would ever make contact with earth. So Trump is behind with the Space Force then? agent_2:probably. Do you remember when Wikileaks published the government's  plans to destroy wikileaks. Interesting. agent_1:I heard about that. I'm guessing that plan didn't work out so well, did it?	agent_2:Not so much! I think it is interesting that 86% of the land in nevada is owned by the US government. I didn't realize that could still happen.
27687	agent_2:I believe that the creator of Facebook is color blind.  So, he tends to not use the colors he can not see. Facebook is worth 104 billion dollars.  Nearly the 1/16 th the number of animals on the planet. agent_1:That is insane Too bad for Myspace who had the chance to buy it and passed on it for $75 million agent_2:Hard to believe a simple registry of name, occupation, schools attended and so on would be worth so much.  It must be the advertising and cookies.	agent_1:I am sure that is it. Iceland seem to like it so much though, that they are using it to get feedback from people and rewrite the constitution
72715	agent_2:I loved the show one of my favorites growing up, Pikachu is the best agent_1:Yeah, I remember when they were originally big in the 90s, but I was already an adult then. agent_2:I see, do you like Tennis then?	agent_1:No, I'm not a sports person at all. Are you a fan?
137065	"agent_1:Wow, that's quite interesting! I used to enjoy watching ""Full House"", so it's good to see how far they've come since then. Speaking of money though, did you know that Blockbuster declined several offers to buy netflix for $50 million. Netflix is now worth $2 billion. I would have chosen differently. agent_2:Me too.  I wonder if Hollywood Video could have bought them? agent_1:Maybe, but ironically enough it was after racking up a $40 late fee on a vhs copy of apollo 13 that reed hastings was inspired to start netflix. Despite their prices, I have to agree it's the smartest method, because customers don't have to drive anywhere."	agent_2:Yeah it sucked to have to drive to pick up and bring back DVDs.  Good thing its all streaming now.
60636	agent_1:Thats strange, being alergic would make sense if not his missing out on one of the best fruits agent_2:Did you know there is only 1 left handed football player in the league? agent_1:No what is his name? 	agent_2:Kellan Moore. Nice chat!
105683	agent_1:Man i feel you on that, I hate golf, has to be the most boring sport ever created. Do you like Linkin Park? agent_2:I know Golf is the worst even though there are so many Golf courses in the US they take up more land space than Rhode Island and Delaware haha very popular! But on TV wow sooo slow.  agent_1:Yeah and there is a golf course in Dubai that requires 4 million gallons of water a day, seems like such a huge waste of water.	agent_2:Wow! These Golf courses require a lot of care! And yes, I love Linkin Park! I have all of their albums on my phone and if given the chance watch them on Youtube on my TV....So sad Chester passed away.
73169	agent_1:That's right he did pass. Too bad. Yeah, I heard it did well in 2014?  agent_2:Something like that. NWA's album Straight Outta Compton is another one that's done well agent_1:Yeah, I used to listen to that one a long time ago. It was good. 	agent_2:It did well without a major tour or airplay. It's the first to reach platinum status without those things
11732	agent_2:Is that right? I didn't know that. I have never visited Hawaii yet. I hope to go some day. It would take a long time though. Did you know air travel is actually slower now than in the 1960's to save on fuel costs? agent_1:I didn't know that. I know that Japan is crazy expensive to travel, as they have mainly toll roads. agent_2:I didn't know about the toll roads. I visited Japan and only took trains. there is a website for people that will let you crash on their couch while you're traveling. That can help make it less expensive.	agent_1:I wouldn't want people crashing on mine, or be comfortable crashing. It's weird that there aren't that many cars in Iceland. Or buses.
137818	agent_2:Agreed. Or have voting options like president banana or president carrot. agent_1:Yes, give them a choice of none of the above. Or make them pay a fine for not voting  agent_2:Interesting. I do know the courts have been putting more pressure on limiting voter cards so that might work.	agent_1:In australia you vote or pay a fine. must vote. its your govt so you need to vote. cant blame others for the govt
28769	agent_2:I just read it and its very surprising. agent_1:Do you think google just wanted to be humorous agent_2:Not sure. Can you believe that professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week?	agent_1:I somehow believe that, but it is such a waste of shoes.  Hahaha
85719	agent_2:WOW!!!!  That's quite a bit of travel!  Did you find that in Japan all of the highways are tolls? Quite expensive, as it costs more than three hundred dollars from one end to the other!!!!! agent_1:Yes, but I am a fan of toll roads.  I like that the users bear the cost of keeping the roads up.  It seems fairer than a sales some other tax unrelated to roads.  What do you think? agent_2:Very good point!  However, I wouldn't want to have to pay that much.  Here, at least we have a choice.  Toll or not.  	agent_1:What are your thoughts on alternative transporation.  The dutch are designing a  commuter bus that  supposedly travel 160 MPH.  That is either a very short commute time or a very long commute distance.
21169	agent_1:I haven't seen him lately.  I hope he hasn't ended up being on Blutube  That's the police version of youtube right? agent_2:It is! Oh my goodness! That would be terrible for him! agent_1:Hahah....I'm surprised he hasn't done a rap song yet.  Are you a  rap fan?	agent_2:A little. I hear Drake is a big fan of reading though!
6465	agent_1:Hi, how are you? agent_2:Hi, I'm doing good how are you? agent_1:I'm good, thanks for asking.  Do you watch Game of Thrones?	agent_2:I've never actually seen GOT. The only thing I know about it, is that it's a drama show.
139977	agent_1:cool beans ;)The university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink - I wonder how that helps in... well - anything ;) agent_2:Good question.  Probably to make the opposing team feel girly./ agent_1:opposing ? :) I would feel a little girly walking from a locker room like that :) lol	agent_2:Haha, yeah the visitors.  No doubt.  Guess it's a slap in the face to the other team.  In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars
44898	agent_1:I think that there has been only one case of them biting and the diver was careless when feeding them. agent_2:So like what if you jump in a pool of blood first and then try and get eaten? agent_1:I suppose that they would oblige you, but while I've done crazy things before, I'm not suicidal. If I thought there was a White around I wouldn't even go in the water.	agent_2:Yea they probably would eat. Do you go for scuba a lot?
124556	agent_1:You're right!  Did you know that Ringo Starr, George Carlin, and Alec Baldwin have all narrated Thomas the Tank for at least 52 episodes each? agent_2:I think I have heard about that before, very cool!  Such an interesting mix of people to narrate.  agent_1:I agree.  It's been fun chatting with you!	agent_2:Same here, I hope you have a great day!
18164	"agent_2:I think it was called Nintendo 54 at one point. That must be why. It was discontinued in Japan in 2003.  agent_1:really! Nice...Bill nye ""the science guy"" got his break in entertainment by winning a steve martin lookalike contest. agent_2:He does look like him! Ronald Reagan got rejected for a movie because they didn't think he had a ""presidential look"""	"agent_1:The arrow through the head gave it away... Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis by famous player rene ""the crocodile"" lacoste and only later adopted by polo players"
104144	agent_1:I think Pokemon started when I was a kid, but apparently they put out 50 episodes a year for 16 years. My son was sort of into Pokemon for awhile. agent_2:I find pokemon cards all over the house! That's a lot of pokemon episodes! agent_1:My son went through a phase of collecting them. He still has them in piles in his room in random places. 	agent_2:Ive washed about a dozen of them. I really do not like them when I am cleaning them out of a wash basin.
108917	agent_1:Also because of all the recent shootings - it really brings the issue of gun control into the spotlight. agent_2:That's very true. I also find it interesting that democrats just view guns as the problem and not the person committing the crime with the gun. agent_1:I don't think all Democrats feel this way - many feel that law must exist to help control the terrible things that human beings are capable of.	agent_2:I completely agree with that and same is probably true for republicans. Republicans probably don't all think that the shooter is entirely responsible.
122404	agent_1:It was harassed? How come, I wonder what other people's opinions about it are. Do you mind sharing? agent_2:The dude was just making inappropriate comments about women in the NFL.  agent_1:No matter what people believe about the issues surrounding Kavanagh and Dr. Ford, it is very wrong to treat a woman and call them offensive names like that.	agent_2:Thank you. It is crazy how much it is entangled in society Harvey Weinstein has had so many allegations
70803	agent_2:I don't know the web address. We keep meaning to look at it but haven't yet. It's on the to-do list. Yes, their workers really get their exercise! It's because of all those 1-click orders that Amazon got a patent on.  agent_1:That makes shopping so easy! Do you like comedy or drama shows? agent_2:Mostly comedy. Some drama but I'm not too into the violence on some dramas. It's funny that the Green Lantern was first meant to be a comedy. I just can't picture that!	agent_1:I know
137182	agent_1:That's amazing! They've been making their own stuff since 2012, which I also didn't know until recently.  agent_2:They've got odd standards though.  There are places in Europe where they monitor illegal downloads in order to decide which shows to buy. agent_1:Oh, really? That is odd. Between them and Youtube, they take up a lot of internet traffic! Over half in of it in North America	agent_2:That's a lot of people online and watching movies and tv shows.  I'm not sure if this is good or bad but there's an hour long video of a fireplace on netflix people watch too.
69415	agent_2:That is a lot of walking. But I have worked in hospitals where I probably walked that much. You can get used to almost anything if you have to. agent_1:Yes that's true. Do you ever watch movies by the way? I never knew that Amazon actually owned imdb.com, they have since 1998 agent_2:I watch some but not that much. I didn't know they owned imdb.com. I'm sure we would be amazed if we saw the whole list of what they own.	agent_1:Yes I think you're right. Maybe one day they'll only entire internet? How often do you use the internet by the way?
108705	agent_2:Google is too important. Too Big To Go Down. TBTGD. I wish I had bought their stock. Instead of hiring people to mow lawns around their headquarters, Google once used hundreds of live goats. Did the goats get stock options? If they did, I would be a goat. agent_1:Hahaha, that is awesome. I like how Google likes to have fun. However, they also scare me. I wonder if we have to consent to them tracking Android devies to track how fast traffic moves.	agent_2:We are all part of the GoogleUniverse, the Googleverse.
68531	agent_1:I have been to bad concerts. usually i never see the band again. agent_2:Me too, have you heard about the lawsuit for a bad concert? agent_1:that sounds very american! LOL who got sued?	agent_2:In 2002, a creed concert was so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band.
130154	agent_2:Both. Some were really funny, for the time, while others were dramas. Do you know about the war of the worlds? agent_1:I do, I saw the movie, but didn't listen to the broadcast. What about you?  agent_2:I have heard about it and listened to Radiolab podcast about it. There were actually like three others. One in Latin America so infuriated the people, they burned the radio station down when they were told it was a hoax.	agent_1:Interesting. Do you listen to Youtube?
110122	agent_2:Yes, term limits are great. Many countries do not have those. agent_1:I think it destroys democracy when politicians have a job for life. Anyway, great chat! agent_2:Great chatting with you as well. Keep an eye out for a possible future summit with Trump and some Asian countries. Should be interesting.	agent_1:Will do. Roger and out.
140928	agent_2:I guess you're not a fast reader. Did you know that the record for reading speed is 4700 words per minute? agent_1:Oh that means I am not a fast reader??  didnt know that.   agent_2:Are you much of a car person? I bet you don't know who Cadillac was named after.	agent_1:Someone who's last name was Cadillac?? lol  I find it weird that Jann mardenborough became a pro race car driver by playing a lot of games of gran turismo video game.
40481	"agent_2:Speaking of U.S. military, former President and Commander-In-Chief Andrew Johnson never attended school. He relied on his wife to help him learn reading and math. agent_1:In the 18th century there was a ""moral panic"" because of the spread of the reading of novels. agent_2:That's fascinating. I wonder what they would have thought about George R.R. Martin. When he was young, he sold dramatic monster stories to other children in his neighborhood for pennies."	agent_1:Wow, that's crazy. I wond how much those are worth now a days...
14953	agent_2:That's pretty eye opening of how short humans have lived on the Earth. agent_1:It is a shame though that in such a short time we have destroyed 80% of earth's nature forests. I hope we can change that for the better going forward the next few minutes agent_2:The Earth is almost 4 times as dense as the sun. 	agent_1:That is pretty cool. Do you think earth will continue to be the only life inhabited planet?
151972	agent_2:haha carson palmer also does too ! strange stuff you learn - but nice to chat with you also  agent_1:Bye agent_2:bye	agent_1:Bye
148071	agent_1:Hello - how are you doing today? agent_2:I'm doing well, and you?  agent_1:I'm doing good. Thanks for asking. Did you know the 3 wealthiest presidents were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson?	agent_2:I'm surprised Trump is not in there, but perhaps it is true on an inflation adjusted basis.
138314	agent_1:I didn't know that! I know it was probably for the show House. Did you ever watch that? That's a lot of money. agent_2:Yes, $700,000 for one episode of House, wow. That's unbelievable.  That show must have raked in the bucks! agent_1:And it was even on Fox lol. That's usually a death sentence for shows haha. Did you know how Michael Caine got into acting?	agent_2:Yes, I heard that all the prettiest girls in his high school were enrolled in drama class, so he joined the drama club to be close to them.  At least he did it the smart way.
64276	agent_1:Wow! That's a lot of people to beat!  I'm not surprised about the video game thing. I've heard a lot of drivers actually practice for upcoming tracks by playing racing games. agent_2:I loved that game have you heard of the brand Cadillac? agent_1:I have.  They have some nice vehicles.	agent_2:The brand was named after a French explorer, his name Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac
73012	agent_1:I am part of that, nothing like relaxing with netflix before bedtime! Did you ever hear how netflix started? agent_2:40 dollar late fees? agent_1:yep from blockbuster for apollo 13. I wonder how blockbuster is doing now	agent_2:
93003	agent_1:yeah good for them what a career and a job. agent_2:Exactly! I like to listen to Baseball on the radio in my car, do you still listen to the radio? agent_1:from time to time. have you managedto listen to jupiter's storms?	agent_2:I have not, but would love to. I hear it plays on an A.M station....pretty creepy!
119674	agent_2:If you stand on the moon, the sun would be white because there is no atmosphere. Maybe on the moon we could capture enough energy to power a space station there. The sun produces a ton of energy. agent_1:Yeah  I heard the sun produces enough energy in only a sec to meet the needs of our planets for like 500000 years! isnt that amazing! agent_2:And it's only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star in our galaxy! I bet if we captured energy from lightning bolts, we could solve our energy needs as well.	agent_1:I think thats a great idea, after all they are 5 times hotter than the sun, that would definetely leave a nasty burn
158697	agent_1:maybe they do, i imagine they have to be pretty popular being he is in charge agent_2:Could be. In Canda there is a law that all radios are required to have at least 40% of the music played be Canadian. He could make a law that radio stations had to play his songs! Could you imagine a pop star president in the United States? I don't think we've had one of those... yet agent_1:Haha imagine Trump controlling the radio station, that would be entertaining regardless of what side you are on	agent_2:The White House still uses floppy disks in part for storing files, I feel like they'll never get it together to be radio stars!
85651	agent_1:Yeah, I did. How much does a whopper cost? $1.25?  agent_2:I think so, well that's kind of low for going through those  changes.  agent_1:Yeah, I think so too. For a whopper? LOL. Hilarious. 	agent_2:Did you know the sun is only 1 billionth size of the biggest star in the galaxy?
77599	agent_1:i'm proud of all the people who made the effort.  it shows me that they value the process of voting.  they knew it would be risky but they took the chance and went out to vote.   agent_2:yes definitely! And plus Many who managed to cast votes described scenes of frenzied confusion and disorganization, with ballot boxes missing and names recorded wrong, how can this even be possible...  agent_1:incredible.  this is a whole new thing for them; a new process; but people showed great patience.  it was critical for them not to be deterred.  a real  learning experience for them.	agent_2:The head of the Free and Fair Election Forum of Afghanistan, Mohammad Yousuf Rasheed, said the monitoring group was pleased that people wanted to come out and vote despite the security threats, but we were disappointed to see the lack of preparation by the election commission staff and the threats by local power brokers in some provinces that influenced people to vote for them, what do you think?
96569	agent_1:I used to love the vinyl LP's that had the covers that opened like a book.  I would always prop them up and just stare at whoever I was crushing on at the time!  The sound was pretty good too. agent_2:All formats have distinctive sound that can be appreciated, except the audio cassette, I won't regret its disappearance.  agent_1:Did you ever take the time and listen to the Dark side of the moon and Watch the Wizard of Oz?  I can't believe it is still such a great selling album.	agent_2:It is because it is a great album (that I have), rock music is the future classical music.
122827	agent_1:Yup. Do you know what the hamburger button is? agent_2:Yeah, those 3 little lines icon.  I'm sad to learn that Gene Wilder died in 2016.  I loved him in Blazing Saddles among other movies.  agent_1:I am not sure if I know him. And apparently you can develop addiction by clicking too much  on the internet	agent_2:If that's the case, I must be an addict.  Things have advanced so quickly.  It wasn't that long ago that New Yorkers were dialing 212 for their area code on a rotary phone.
34157	agent_1:Yes I don't really see the appeal myself. Stephen King thanks Bambi is a horror movie. It is very disturbing especially if you're a kid. Have you seen the movie The Shining agent_2:I am not sure, I might have. It's surprising that the boy from the Shining didn't know he was acting in a horror film. I hope that means that it was not scary for him. agent_1:I think that's what it means yes. I'm glad he wasn't Disturbed after making that movie. There are definitely some messed up scenes in there. have you ever used a water phone?	agent_2:Right? No, I haven't used a water phone. I want one so I can discretely follow people around making noise on the water phone.
134238	agent_1:Makes sense agent_2:Do you know who the Baseball team that's lost the most world series championships is? agent_1:I want to say the Yankees, 	agent_2:Close the Brooklyn Dodgers. I guess that means they've probably gone more times then any other team.
30862	"agent_2:Interesting,  Frozen was a pretty good movie.  Did you ever see it? agent_1:Oh my god those songs are still ringing in my ears, lol! It came out in 2013 3D computer animated musical fantasy film. agent_2:Did you know Elsa was supposed to be the villain however ""let it go"" was so uplifting they changed her character?"	agent_1:Wow, that would have changed the movie a bit. Did i hear correct it's the first Disney film directed by a women?
32045	agent_2:That's funny, What kind of snake do you have? I use to have 2 ball pythons when I was younger. agent_1:Ball python. I am not as bad as Teddy Roosevelt, who had 20 pets, including a bear and a hyena, but  am moving in that direction. agent_2:I would love to get to hang out with a hyena for a bit. I actually got to go into an enclosure with one and it was very playful, but extremely strong. I never knew had so many pets!	agent_1:Everything I know about hyenas I learned from the movie, Lion King... LOL  Of course, if we lived in Boulder, CO, it would be illegal to own pets... We can be guardians, but not owners!
102935	agent_2:Oh wow I never even heard of that! Do they have any celebrity actors like Ringo Starr or George carlin who also did Thomas the tank engine? agent_1:I'm not sure. If they do they are British stars I don't know. It's a British show. He also likes the British kids TV show called Peppa Pig. agent_2:Yeah I guess he got off easy! I will have to Google that show later and check it out. So many people use Google it once went down for five minutes and took 40% of web traffic with it.	agent_1:Well, I'm glad google is up now, because I need to google how to fix clothing. My jeans are way too big on me but I like them so much!
55870	agent_2:i think that there are backups of portions of it all over the place. cant imagine it being in one place. agent_1:That would make more sense, like you said before it must be really heavy with all the info out there agent_2:changing the subject, what do you think of the Sun?	agent_1:I think the sun is amazing, a hot plasma body that generates a lot of energy
67323	agent_1:Hmmm, yeah that is a great point. I agree. Ya know Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction, wild fun fact.  agent_2:Interesting. Back in 1953 Churchill won the nobel prize in literature! agent_1:Wow, really!! A judge once tried to ban science fiction, weird.	agent_2:Glad the ban didn't work! All because it featured a black character? That is quite extreme.
88986	agent_2:I had heard about that. It should be interesting considering that Space Jam is the highest-grossing basketball movie of all time.  agent_1:Yeah I am curious when it will actually come out.  Did you know he raised 6 million for charity when he hosted that 'the decision' thing a few years ago? agent_2:No, wow that is amazing!  	agent_1:Yeah that is really cool I thought, I bet a lot of people don't know that is what he did after he aired that.
80664	agent_2:That's no surprising. I wonder how much it will cost to ride the 160mph commuter bus the dutch are designing agent_1:That is a fast bus. However, it seems expensive. agent_2:Yea but can't be more expensive than being forced to use domestic flights in Iceland due to no public rail service	agent_1:Well, look at the Mackinac Island. They used horse-drawn carriages or bikes.
86635	agent_1:Probably the content of the book she read, which still sounds good - it takes a village. agent_2:Exactly! I am learning a ton about her. Middle name is Diane? Who knew! agent_1:Obama too.. the google maps picture of the white house has obama!	agent_2:Hopefully it has the secret service on it too! I find him interesting too! Code name Renegade!
160111	agent_2:That's true, I hear the New Orleans Saints cheerleaders, have it pretty bad. agent_1:Yeah, they are required to leave a restaurant if a player comes in. Why isnt it the other way around? agent_2:It makes you wonder what happened that initially prompted that rule to be instituted? 	agent_1: it was something. I just dont see why the cheerleaders have to be the ones to suffer.
15637	agent_2:Michael Jordan often represents Nike. Kids love him. agent_1:Yeah!  (Loved him in Space Jam)  I always thought it was neat that they used him as the Air Jordan logo  agent_2:I admire him too.  	agent_1:Did you know that wasn't even how he jumped when he played basketball?  He was doing a ballet jump!
29888	agent_2:Getting two big name stars our of the same town is rare, so youre probably right.  I wonder who else might have come from there as well? agent_1:It is rare maybe its the water lol, I think more players come from there as well agent_2:And so many form championship teams.  I heard once LeBron's high school games could have tickets up to 100$.	agent_1:a $100 no kidding, thats a lot of money for a high school game, Im sure it was worth it though
122926	agent_2:Even after 40 years, I would rather listen to the Dark SIde of the Moon than to Dion. It was still one of the top albums in 2014... Timeless! agent_1:Or Hybrid Theory by Linkin Park. That album is one of the best selling of this century for a reason agent_2:Yup. I wouldn't mind hearing Celine Dion try to make a rap album, but I don't think she would even be as good as those Japanese twins that released their first  rap album at 100 yrs old.	agent_1:That's one way to celebrate making it a century! They were alive during both the Word Wars and could have rapped about it
103080	agent_2:Sorry, Pokemon Go. I did play games on the Gameboy Color back in the day. Do you like tv shows that are not cartoons? How about That 70s Show? agent_1:Pokemon Go is a grind. Also I enjoyed the 70s show. It was made verbatim in the uk, but too bad it was cancel so soon, only after 10 ep. agent_2:Yeah, well I can see that. I can't see the characters being the same especially if made in UK English verbatim. What did you watch when you were younger? Did you ever watch Thomas the Tank Engine?	agent_1:Well I watched cartoons on 4kids. I never liked Thomas the Tank engine since cars with eyes were somehow weird. I also watch teletubies which somehow were acceptable at the time. Now I realize very creepy
159577	agent_1:Gabriel Iglesias.  Enrique was the singer.   agent_2:Yeah, based on looks, you could understand my confusion.  agent_1:LOL.  DO you have a favorite?	agent_2:I love the classics like Richard Prior and Eddie Murphy. The new stuff, I like Neal Brennan.
132272	agent_2:I did not but when I think about they have had so many shows cancelled. I didn't realize it was that many though.  agent_1:Did you realize that the creator of the python programming language named it partly to honor British Comedy group, Monty Python? agent_2:No I did not but that's amazing! I don't know how that never crossed my mind. 	agent_1:On a different note, did you realize the US president's guest house is larger than the White House?
37239	agent_1:Hello Friend, are you interested in the Internet? agent_2:hi how are you? yes i am interested in the internet. agent_1:The Internet is a network of networks that uses the Internet Protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices world wide. 	agent_2:It has been around for decades. most people dont know that though. they think it is a recent invention.
44115	agent_2:I know what you are talking about now. It sounds like what the movie The Green Lantern was going to be when Jack Black was supposed to be it's star. agent_1:Noway, I never heard that. Wwo, I think Jack Black is so funny! The other actor I like is Bill Murray. agent_2:Yes, Bill Murray has the perfect dead pan face. I like the classics even those black and white movies.	agent_1:Yeah, I do too. They are fun to watch on a lazy Sunday type of day. I don't really care for horror films. I have watched s few Stephen King movies though. He is a great writer and so its hard to not watch his.
105841	agent_2:Yeah, I can't buy a date with a model for a dollar though. I can get a lotto tick for $1. That is enough for hopes. agent_1:That is true! you need to win the lottery to for sure get the model girlfriend agent_2:Cant do it the other way around unfortunately. I guess Ill have to wait until I get lucky to get lucky.	agent_1:lol, I think I could be President before getting a model. Or be like Trump...
28518	agent_1:Its nice to see someone's hard work pay off.  I hope she stays successful and happy for a long time to come. agent_2:She is cool to her fans too. She once bought $1000 worth of pizza for waiting fans. agent_1:Wow, that is so nice.  Just a little something like that can make everyone's day a little brighter.  Did you know her favorite band is Iron Maiden?	agent_2:I didn't know that. Did you like her song Telephone? It got a world record for most product placement in a music video. Not sure what product or products though
30101	agent_2:Oh, yeah.  Golden State.  Man, I really though Houston had a chance to beat Golden State in the Western conference finals last season.  Steph Curry's pretty amazing. agent_1:He was both in the same city as LeBron was, Okron, OH. agent_2:Hmm.. Never knew that.  Not a big LeBron fan.  I do have to say I'm impressed with Steph Curry though.  MVP and only the 4th highest paid player on his team in 2015.	agent_1:Most of us know him by his middle name, but his first name is actually Wardell, like his father's
63411	agent_1:Not mine either.  I'm surprised that there are no economic gains for the countries that have played host to the Olympics or the World Cup.  I wonder if it's because they spend so much on the infrastructure for the events? agent_2:It is sad that infrastructures go to waste after all of it, leaving a lot of debt agent_1:I know what you mean.  It's crazy they build up everything and then there's no use for it.	agent_2:For sure, I liked someones idea one time that there should just be one location that other countries host from there
141327	agent_1:I wonder if we'll ever see the end of Facebook, a lot of places don't see it too favorably. For some reason, Facebook's like button is illegal in a part of Germany. agent_2:Oh wow! Maybe that's why they added other options... At least I noticed my brother doing a smiley face instead of a like, I believe. I just found out that Mark Zuckerberg made facebook blue, because he suffers from red-green blindness! crazy! agent_1:I didn't know that's why Facebook is blue! I'm sure other colorblind folk appreciate it too haha. And that's true Facebook is becoming even bigger in other areas, I heard Iceland is actually rewriting their constitution and using Facebook to get the public to make suggestions.	agent_2:Oh wow! I wouldn't like having to join just to make suggestions. But I'm sure they have other means of getting suggestions. At least I hope so. Actually I appreciate the blue as well. Not that I use facebook, I just appreciate blue! :) Time flies! Facebook was created in 2004!
89351	"agent_1:How's it going, do you like horror film? Many were inspired by Edgar Allen Poe, Stroker, and Mary Shelley agent_2:Yes, I just found out about the latest one that I want to see call ""A Quiet Place"". It's a silent thriller starring real-life married couple John Krasinski and Emily Blunt and is the No. 1 movie in the country.  I liked that horror movie called  agent_1:Yea I heard A Quiet Place got great reviews and Kraniski did a great job writing it"	"agent_2:What I meant to say earlier was that I liked that movie called ""Get Out"", it was really suspenseful and full of outrageous surprises. I like Stephen Spielberg's sci-fi dramas as well."
156341	agent_1:You know it probably wouldnt be very surprising if he came out with an album while in office haha. agent_2:He should, I hear him and Kanye are really close so that could be a real thing, I would buy that album agent_1:I think it would sell. He could give himself a name like zimbabwes first president. President banana.	agent_2:I think that was actually the name of the president, it was Canaan Banana, sounds like a nickname but no, actual name
5648	agent_2:Yeah and I think there will be profitable business there as well so its win win for those companies as well.  agent_1:Yes, agreed.  You even have a company like Lockheed Martin that can take kids on a virtual reality tour of Mars! agent_2:Wow, now wouldn't that be something.  I wonder if they will be able to do that with planets further out in the future?	agent_1:With all of those companies and a company like Facebook worth over $100 billion I am sure they sky the is the limit.
86616	agent_2:So do you also like Jazz? I think its a great music genre, so relaxing, so peacefull agent_1:I liked the more upbeat jazz that you can dance to.  agent_2:Have you watched Breaking Bad? apparently theres a Jazz musician caller Walter White that has an album named Breaking Good	agent_1:No I haven't, that is so cool. Do you like Clint Eastwood? He absolutely loves jazz.
125077	agent_2:How true.  Did you know the US military uses an Xbox controller to control one of its eod robots? agent_1:No, but that is pretty cool.  I wonder how connected some of the major businesses like Microsoft are to the US military and others around the world.  agent_2:Probably alot more than we know about for sure.  All these games for kids are just practice for future warfare, I think.	agent_1:Yeah I think you may be right about that.  On a different subject, did you know that 86% of the land in Nevada is owned by the US government?
111796	agent_2:they sure have, they have been doing themselves very few favors as of late agent_1:I remember reading that they euthanized pets after some of their raids. agent_2:I am not sure if there was a valid reason for it though, Vets do the same thing. PETA is right about animal pageants though, I concede that	"agent_1:Yeah, I'm sympathetic to the animal rights movement in general. PETA just seems to subordinate actual living animals to its ""pro-animal"" agenda."
136465	agent_2:I feel like that's not soon enough. What were they doing? agent_1:apparently nothing! I would feel so insecure there. Althought I did read that George Bush had solar panels put on the white house. Thank goodness someone is trying to save money there! agent_2:Teddy Roosevelt was a staunch conservationist. He started the national park and forest service.	agent_1:I'm glad he did. Congress just passed a new bill to expand all the parks and forests too.
88123	agent_1:Me too, she's a beast!  Hope she's on the mend after her recent fall, though.  On a different note, did you know the New Zealand basketball team is nicknamed the Tall blacks?  Isn't that kind of racist, to you? agent_2:Yeah that is pretty racist. I don't think I would want to wear any of their memorabilia. Did you know that the inventor of basketball, James Naismith, is the only losing coach in the University of Kansas history? agent_1:Me either very racist.  I don't know how they get away with that in 2019?  Anyway, I think it's very ironic about James Naismith, as the inventor he should have rigged the game of basketball to allow his teams to win.	"agent_2:It brings a new meaning to ""beating you at your own game."" lol"
81353	agent_1:I love that they consider Remi a member of the baseball team, and seems to help everyone with their anxiety. agent_2:Yeah.  They say if you pet a dog for 15 minutes, it will change your lookout on the day. agent_1:Therapy isn't the only jobs dogs can have, they can also assist police and military.	agent_2:Yeah.  It's wild that dogs have 12 different blood types.
162842	agent_2:I believe it's something soldiers made? agent_1:Yes it is. They made them in World War II actually. That use a pencil as the diode, and then they use a razor blade as well. I don't know how that turns into a radio though LOL agent_2:Me either, but I guess it worked! If you are into classic radio dramas, you can listen to them on a website for free!	agent_1:Well I didn't know that. I'll have to check that out. Do you speak classical Latin by the way? There's a station in Finland that plays classical Latin news on the radio
149990	agent_2:I do know him!  He broke his leg really bad didn't he this past season? agent_1:Yeah I think so. Huge blow to their team. Anyways he was very smart in high school and he took a ton of AP classes and eventually received his bachelors degree in two years. agent_2:That's pretty cool!  Did you know that Baker Mayfield once considered quitting football to pursue a full time competitive gaming career?  Crazy.	agent_1:Yeah I never knew that. There must be a lot of money in halo three.
110398	agent_2:I know that the main emphasis is on humour and are designed to make the audience laugh. agent_1:Do you like what they call bromantic comedies? I'm a big fan of Seth Rogen films, like Pineapple Express and Superbad. agent_2:If they are well done. I really like them. I loved the two you just mentioned.	agent_1:Agreed. I like some of the classics, like anything that Bill Murray has done.
74616	agent_1:They actually remind me more of insects in their sounds.  The sound more like a Jupiter radio storm. agent_2:I think the storms on Jupiter deserves their chance at a Grammy, especially considering all the bad music on the radio these days. Boy, I tell ya, kids these days! agent_1:Yeah, if Fox News can have a gaming website then Jupiter should have a shot at a Grammy. 	agent_2:The median viewer age for Fox News is 68. Are they going to play games? I don't THINK so.
75876	"agent_2:That is odd. I wonder why. Originally the ""like"" button was to be called the ""awesome"" button. agent_1:Seriously?  I'm glad they changed it.  Do you know why they made it blue? agent_2:No I'm not sure why they picked blue."	agent_1:Mark Zuckerberg is red-green colorblind so it's blue.
38615	agent_1:hi do you play chess? agent_2:Not really but I know it is pretty popular and you? agent_1:Yeah sometimes I play. There are more positives moves in a game than atoms in the universe	agent_2:Nice one, THe president of the world federation thinks it was invented by aliens
148841	agent_1:Maybe if he did it with a Canadian accent he could get played on Canadian radio. They have a 40% Canadian quota there.  agent_2:That is a high percentage and that is by law. But at least is understandable, imagine if it was in a language like latin agent_1:You'd have to go to Finland for that. But it's all Greek to me. 	agent_2:And it is broadcasted since 1989,there must be someone who actually listens to it!
38824	agent_2:I don't doubt that lightning is very hot.  It sets many things on fire where it hits. agent_1:It is really powerful.I hate lightening but the sun provides so much. It provides energy in one second that will meet the needs of the entire planet for 500,000 years agent_2:The sun accounts for well over 99% of solar system mass and it's burning full tilt, so it's not surprising that it is creating that much energy.	agent_1:good talking to you.
76898	agent_1:Haha what? Is that true? I thought it was his dunk from the free throw line. agent_2:It is designed to resemble that but he did not do that big a split in his dunk agent_1:Very interesting. So Michael Jordan actually danced or it was just modeled after a ballet leap?	agent_2:He did ballet to help with his agility.
133947	agent_2:sad.  They should do a study on voter turnout like Psephology is the study of results and statistics relating to elections.  Never heard that term. agent_1:Me neither, they should hire someone to find them a better name, when I read it I thought that you spilled coffee on your keyboard.  agent_2:i wish!  or we could have a pop star run for president...  the president of Indonesia has released 3 pop albums since he has been in office.  crazy	agent_1:I would have thought that he would stop after the first. But he continued. Maybe he rigged the election, then he wanted to rig the top 100.
74074	"agent_2:Did you know that google actually prefers dogs.  agent_1:what do you mean by ""prefers""? agent_2:Their code of conduct actually states that they are a dog company. They prefer dogs over cats."	agent_1:thats such a fun thing to have in your code of conduct. are you more of a dog person than cat person?
121796	agent_1:We're at 8 so we have 2 more. Did you know there is a jellyfish that is immortal? Kind of like this chat? agent_2:Okay, jelly fish are kind of gross. What is amazing is the black swallower fish. It's hard to believe that a being can eat something that's twice it's length and ten times its weight and survive. It must get heartburn. It would be so heavy, how could it still swim? agent_1:HA! Heartburn... That's funny. I heard that some snakes can eat humans whole!	agent_2:The zebrafish facts are also very interesting. I worked at a university and the researchers there work with zebrafish a lot. Now I know why; 84 per cent of their genes can be related  somehow to human diseases.
73976	agent_1:Yeah, good point there. DO you know how the drive thru came about? agent_2:I heard it had to do with soldiers. agent_1:Yeah they were not allowed to get out of their cars in uniforms back in the day	agent_2:So interesting. Too bad the side effect is that I (along with other Americans) got lazy from it!
148533	agent_1:Yes I think you're right. She also had a daughter named Cora. I can imagine it would be hard to balance a child in a career like she talks about agent_2:Yes, after Cora was born, her husband returned to work and she was stuck at home without a car, without a job, and without a social circle.  agent_1:Hopefully she could use a car to get around at least. Do you drive a car?	agent_2:Yes, I do. Do you know why they call the back of our cars, trunks?
19933	"agent_1:People have told me I should but I have never tried. Maybe I will. I wrote a poem for a dear friend at work who's son died and the weekly news letter published it I thought that was very nice. agent_2:i think it's great that you did that and i'm sure your friend will always remember that.  the folks who become famous poets are surely gifted.  did you know that Poe only got $9 for the publication of his classic poem ""the raven?"" amazing. agent_1:Thank you, I like to show people how much I care in different ways and poetry is very personal. That is crazy! I love that poem. Did you know there is a poem if read normally it is depressing yet reading it backwards is inspiring!"	agent_2:fascinating.  i wonder if the poet who wrote that meant it to be that way, or if it just turned out that way.
87589	agent_1:Humans are the only member of the hominina. They differ from the other creature from the brain and complex languages. agent_2:Thats intersting. Especially considering that it may have been as short as 240000 years ago when humans lost all the hair from their bodies. agent_1:Hominins brain and body is similar to non-human apes are less often referred to as human of the genus Homo.	agent_2:Really. I think, to be honest, that is a little bit above my ability to comprehend a conversation about.
129988	agent_2:I know , I'm surprised Trump wasn't listed I know they owned alot of land back then. agent_1:Me too.  Maybe Trump should pump out 3 pop albums like the president of Indonesia.  agent_2:lol, so silly. Hes far to busy and smart for that! lol	agent_1:I suppose.  I can't see him singing anyway.  I'm an (I) but it's interesting that there hasn't been a U.S. president that wasn't a (D) or (R) since 1853.  I think parties divide the nation too much.
54236	agent_2:It makes enough energy in a second to meet the needs of the whole planet in 500,000 years. Guess we have to learn to harness it better. agent_1:wow for sure! someone would make a monopoly on that as well and overcharge us! agent_2:The sun is just this immense presence for us but it's only a billionth the size of the biggest star in our galaxy	agent_1:Right! that makes you think what else is out there and all of that fun stuff!
76062	agent_2:Oh, definitely!  He's the former quarterback of the Oklahoma Sooners that has gone on to do a fantastic job for the Browns!  You know quarterbacks are considered leaders of the offense and he has definitely became a leader. agent_1:He once considered retiring from football in order to become a professional competitive video game player.  agent_2:Now that I did not know about him!  He's a great football player and I guess it would make sense that he plays video games so well.  He's probably a very competitive person!	agent_1:I am sure he is. You's have to be to be a top p[layer. I was taken aback when I learned that the huddle was created by a deaf QB.
35250	agent_1:Yea probably was, nowadays all you need is $300 dollars for tolls and you can travel across Japan agent_2:Seems crazy to me, though we pay for wheelage tax and gas taxes here right agent_1:Yea, it be nice if taxes went to something cool like the commuter bus the dutch are designing to go 160mph	agent_2:That would be fun to ride, though I think some trains go faster.
107453	agent_2:Oh wow. How is that country by the way? I only hear bad things in the news these days. And I don't know, I could use a flamethrower right now, I know that my driveway is full of ice lol agent_1:You may have more snow coming depending on where you live.  There is real income inequality in South Africa.  The most expensive thing that most people own is a machine gun, not a house or a car.  I walked by 40 men digging a ditch with pick-axes and they were paid $2 per day.  Did you know that Rap dates back to ancient Egyptians. agent_2:Wow that sounds really crazy. And no I didn't know that, I wish we could Listen to Egyptian rap LOL. Do you ever listen to Tupac Shakur? Apparently some of his music is in the Library of Congress	agent_1:I have heard Tupac.  Muhammad Ali was another early practitioner of Rap like rhythm. I enjoyed him.
24339	agent_2:Yeah and 73 million parts end in soup. No I didn't know that agent_1:Eeeew, gross! Yeah, a shark will crush itself if it were ever on land because of its weight and no rib cage. agent_2:Fun fact but more people get bitten by New Yorkers each year than by sharks	agent_1:HA, yikes, that is good to know , i think? lol
157053	agent_2:Yes.  I love the radio.  You can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas on the internet for free! agent_1:That is interesting, that would make a long road trip a lot better with those. Do you ever get the jupiter radio storms on your am radio? agent_2:I don't know what the Jupiter radio storms are supposed to sound like.  That would be lovely to hear.  It's amazing they can so easily be heard.	agent_1:I would listen to them the whole car ride I think! Did you hear about the canadian law surrounding radios?
46687	agent_2:I do. Did you know you can catch Jupiter's storms in the AM radio? agent_1:Cool. DO you ever listen to Canadian radios? agent_2:Sometimes, they play a ton of Canadian music though during the day	agent_1:Yes but that is because they are required by law to play 40% canadian music
164100	agent_1:I live here, so I guess by default I am.  I'm not born and raised so it's not life or death for me.  Is there anything harder in football than being a Browns fan? agent_2:Well, I would  say no, especially if you are a fan win or lose, because for some reason they seems not to be able to make it to a superbowl these days. agent_1:Do you watch much football on television, Monday night football and all that?	agent_2:No, I watched sunday's game also, my current home is Las Vegas and I pretty much live in the casino watching sports, I try to watch the majority of the games including college football.
72465	agent_1:It might be picking up now with cable cutting! agent_2:Cut the cord, friend! LOL agent_1:Amen! When south park aired its family guy episode finale the producers received flowers from the simpsons crew	agent_2:I was actually thinking about Mat and Trey this morning.  Did you know there is an episode of the Simpsons where Bart does not appear and is not mentioned?
38182	agent_2:I really like Korean rap. I have a couple of albums and some K-Pop too. How about you? agent_1:Not so much. I prefer country music to rap. agent_2:DO you have a favorite country singer?	agent_1:All time favorite would probably be Brad Paisley. Just love how he and sing and play guitar too, which is a large part of country music.
152148	agent_1:I don't know. I find it to be pretty ridiculous. Are you familiar with Alex Smith? agent_2:No, who is he? agent_1:He's a quarterback. He's very intelligent. He was able to enter college as a junior and he was working on his Masters when drafted. 	agent_2:Good for him, I hope he completed it.
65052	agent_1:Wow that is fast! The term planet is ancient too. Lots of history behind it! Well it was lovely talking with you today! agent_2:Earth actually has alternative names. Gaia, Tellus and Telluris agent_1:Very interesting. Well thanks for the insightful conversation!	agent_2:Thank you too. Take care.
79176	agent_2:That sounds pretty cool! But, no, I don't. I heard they are legal in South Africa for carjacking. agent_1:Yeah, they are legal there. I wonder if they have a big problem with it?  agent_2:I assume they do. Sounds scary. Hopefully they have McDonald's there to console them afterwards. McDoanld's put in drive thru windows in 1975.	agent_1:That is pretty interesting. Why do they call a trunk a trunk?
65133	agent_2:I am on the internet everyday. In some way shape or form. Did you know the 3 horizontal line menu on apps and websites is called a hamburger menu.  agent_1:That's so funny. I always see that and now I know what that is. I'm on the internet all the time now, for surveys or for my full-time work or for Netflix or general fun things. I love reading online articles, especially about psychology, I think it's such an interesting field! Do you know of any psychology experiments? agent_2:No. Never really been to into that sort of thing. Im more of the outdoor type. Unless its freezing cold like it has been lately.	agent_1:I live where it's warm so I don't have that problem fortunately. Have you heard about the Milgram experiment? I learned about it in school. They basically led people to believe they were torturing other participants behind a closed door because they were told to by an authoritative figure. How crazy is that? And unethical!
132660	agent_2:I like the simpsons even though some people think the new episodes are not as good as the old ones. Can you believe they finally made an episode were Bart isn't in it? agent_1:I bet that is one of the most viewed episodes after all its rare, did you like Pokemon? agent_2:Yes I've loved pokemon for years although I think there is still a ton of episodes I have not seen. There are over 750 total!	agent_1:Yeah about 750 episodes by now, its been almost 16 years since Pikachu appeared.
58608	agent_1:I have no idea. I suppose they get exposure for concernt tickets and endorsements which seems to be where they make their money now since album sales are down so much.  agent_2:That is true. Their merch and touring definitely has to be the cash cow. I wonder how many people were shocked that that Alex kid admitted everything was fabricated.. agent_1:I'm not familiar with Alex Kid. What was the scandal there?	"agent_2:He was one of the children who ""wrote a book"" about dying and seeing Heaven. ""The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven"". It was published in 2010."
162971	agent_2:I did not, I'm surprised people are liking his Twitter, it's just full of hate and lies. agent_1:Yeah it's interesting that no president has ever used Twitter like Trump has. Speaking of presidents though, do you know who the top three richest presidents were? agent_2:It was JFK, Washington and Jefferson right? I wonder how Washington and Jefferson had so much money?	agent_1:Yes it was probably from slavery actually. I'm just shocked that Trump is not in that list. Also I'm shocked that the president of Indonesia is not in that list because he released three pop albums while he was President haha
137301	agent_1:It reminds me of my child's kickball games, except with a smaller ball. I guess in Canada they call kickball soccer-baseball. agent_2:That's a mouthful. I like kickball better. Did you hear about that man that found baseball cards in his grandfather's attic? agent_1:No. Did he lose them? Don't they have a bunch of statistics on them? Baseball has so many statistics. And why do they use the same players on offense and defense?  They don't do that in football.	agent_2:Yes they do, they just switch back and forth. The baseball cards had been hidden since the 1940's and were from the 1900's. They were worth three million dollars!
4823	agent_1:Yeah, the show has a tremendous following and could go on forever. but i think it is better to draw things to a close. especially because of the author. agent_2:Yes.  Did you know that Harry Lloyd is the great great great grandson of Charles Dickens? agent_1:Harry Lloyd? who is that ? i have heard of Charles Dickens. he wrote oliver twist.	agent_2:Yes...Harry Lloyd plays Visery Targaryen on GOT.
86690	agent_1:True, they are no fun. But we still have them because they are an evolutionary holdover when land animals had lungs and gills agent_2:Very interesting. Speaking of evolution did you know that humans may have lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago? agent_1:That is actually very recent, super interesting. Do you know why we are also good persistence runners?	agent_2:I did not but I guess it makes sense with hunting and evading predators.
106924	agent_2:I bet she was bustin' mad rhymes and spittin' fire yo. That def justice and dope jurisprudence.  agent_1:Word. Serves Emminem anyway, since before he became a rapper he wanted to be a comic book artist. I bet he wished he had chosen that as a profession as he listened to the judge get all busy with it. agent_2:I guess Eminem must be pretty good at drawing. Creative people find some outlet of expression. 	agent_1:True. His favorite superhero was Spiderman. I would have liked to see Emminem in a Spidy costume.
140580	agent_2:Is the shooter, Jarrod Ramos alive or dead now? agent_1:Im not sure, he did kill five people but think he was alive as he is considered the suspect of the crime agent_2:I see.  What was the reason why he was so angry?	agent_1:He had a beef with the Capital Gazette for years, it has something to do with that, there is a paper about him that he found unfair or at least that my understanding of the facts
149338	agent_2:me too. All we have to do is 10 turns right? Hope you have a great xmas. and awesome new year.  agent_1:Yep, it should let us submit soon. Thanks and you too, thanks for responding quickly.  agent_2:no problem. take care. Go Brewers	agent_1:Nice!
147219	agent_1:I do not although I follow a few teams. Do you have a favorite one? agent_2:I am a bears fan. It's a curse. Like knowing the avg NFL game only has 11 minutes of play. agent_1:Really? I wonder how the people watching the games in the stadiums do not get bored with all of the down time  in between.	agent_2:Beer. Lots and lots of beer.
147218	agent_2:Do you have a favorite team? agent_1:I do not although I follow a few teams. Do you have a favorite one? agent_2:I am a bears fan. It's a curse. Like knowing the avg NFL game only has 11 minutes of play.	agent_1:Really? I wonder how the people watching the games in the stadiums do not get bored with all of the down time  in between.
113156	agent_2:Exactly! getting 40 bucks worth of late fee's from a rental...that always sucked! Too bad Blockbuster didn't buy Netflix when they had the chance. agent_1:A mere $50 million?! I have that RIGHT now. I could've bought them with my spare change. But Blockbuster is poorly run! agent_2:Yep, only 50 mil....pocket change! Blockbuster is long gone now! They had good video's but I always just watched television.	agent_1:They have one store left. One store! We must keep it alive to remember the folly.
99827	agent_2:Nice, and when he turns 55 he will get a lump sum of $32,000,000. agent_1:yeah that is insane. many of them make money this way agent_2:Yeah, and some basketball players make a lot of money off of merchandise, like Jordan with Air Jordans. These were actually banned when introduced to the nba. But Jordan wore them anyway and paid a fine for each game.	agent_1:Yeah, well nike must have made much more from the sales to be able to pay the fines everytime
66388	agent_2:Did you Google that?  A single google search requires more computing power than it did to send the astronauts to the moon. agent_1:The International Olympic Committee banned the OAR from South Korea unless they were individual competitors who proved they were clean agent_2:I guess the members of the band OAR thought that was somewhat of a coincidence.  Probably didn't think many people made the connection.	agent_1:Well the band got more publicity due to that.  They did collaborate on a Duracell battery ad for the 2012 London Olympics
51719	agent_2:Did you know that Edna, the superhero costume designer, is voiced by Brad Bird, the films director? agent_1:That's very cool. Brad Bird used artists who were likely to either quit or be fired. agent_2:I heard that he believed they could create everything that he needed. 	agent_1:Yep, that's what it looks like. Do you like entertainment?
31983	agent_1:Did you hear that Amazon is trying to get into sports broadcasting agent_2:Amazon will soon run everything. I bet there is space in there for a company with money. agent_1:Yeah. They are bidding for Disney's business.	agent_2:Maybe Amazon will bring something new to the mix. Disney is big, but Amazon is growing.
75509	agent_2:yes I do, The King of Comedy is actually a pretty good movie, very underrated agent_1:I agree. I did not like the all of the knock offs from that move. I think Bernie Mac was under rated! agent_2:ya he was, so is the movie Kung Foo Hustle, even Bill Murray likes it!	agent_1:Does he like Harold and Kumar, a bromantic comedy!
12107	agent_1:I'm allergic to cat hair too! agent_2:Do you have any pets of your own? agent_1:Nah, that is too much of a hassle. Did you know that google prefers dogs to cats? 	agent_2:I think dogs are the more social animal so it makes sense for a company to have a dog policy over a cat policy. I know of a few people who have therapy dogs that go to hospitals or even to libraries so that children with reading problems can read out loud to them without feeling embarrassed.
49579	agent_2:I do! He's held up much better than most comedians who seem to veer into unfortunate circumstances over the course of their career. I heard he thinks that Kung Fu Hustle is the supreme agent_1:I think it's odd he thinks that movie is the supreme. I didn't think it was that funny. Did you ever see it? agent_2:I did not, but to each his own--humor is pretty subjective. For example, over the course of its existence since 1989, Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 shows	agent_1:I agree. Hard to believe they have cancelled over 100 shows since 1989.
90152	agent_2:That's cool it was the thing to do when we were younger. I like that it went on to be in the Olympics! No, I don't know who that is..... agent_1:I watched it on the Olympics every four years when I was a kid. She participated in the Barcelona games and gave her age as 17. But she was missing front teeth and the rumor is that she may have been as young as 10 in actuality.  agent_2:Omgosh! Really? That's amazing. I heard that an american won 6 medals...with a wooden leg! How amazing! Nobody else with a prosthetic limb tried again for 100 years.	agent_1:Wow! That's very impressive. I'm going to have to look that up and see if there is any imagery out there.
164806	"agent_2:I guess you would have to show them on your phone or something. Maybe there was a link on the website. Does anyone listen to radio anymore? Seems like YouTube is the only game around. agent_1:All it takes to make one is a razorblade and a pencil. agent_2:If that radio got people ""likes"" on FB, it would be popular again. Do you know what CanCon is?"	agent_1:I don't. What is it?
122243	agent_2:You must be talking about the solar panels he also had installed that Reagan removed? agent_1:Yes, Carter put them on then Reagan took them off and then George W. put them back on again. Wow, waht a roller coaster ride for those solar panels. Luckily, the White House is still located at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. NW. agent_2:lol  The last US president to speak a foregin language fluently was FDR.  Wish I could speak another language fluently.	agent_1:Me too, I took Spanish classes but don't know any Spanish people that I could talk to that didn't laugh at my attempts to talk to them so I quit trying.  Even still, speaking of the White House goings on ... it took the Secret Service four days to realize that bullets had struck the White House back in 2011. They must have been napping.
27645	agent_2:that is actually pretty cool. and greeks made asbestos clothing and it was so expensive agent_1:ya and bad for their health probably haha, did you hear about pilgrims and their clothes? agent_2:yeah I like that they stick to colorful clothes	agent_1:ya the plain, black clothes were saved for special occasions apparently
116278	agent_2:Things have changed indeed, 14 of the 25 largest stadiums belong to college football teams.  agent_1:That is interesting, in the university of Iowa agent_2:How big is the stadium at the university of Iowa ?	agent_1:Sorry hit the enter key on accident.  I actually dont know that but they painted their visitors locker room pink.  Haha!
90796	agent_1:Yeah, I know who the Rock is, he's pretty cool.  agent_2:I've missed seeing many of his new movies because I just don't have time. I think the last I saw was Hercules! John Cena is cool, too. He's made the most wishes come true for that make a wish foundation for kids. agent_1:Yeah, I liked him when he was in WWE. I'm not sure if John Cena is still in. Is he? 	agent_2:I think he is but I haven't seen it in a while. Did you ever see the Paris Hilton reality show? She is not a well liked celebrity. lol
21312	agent_1:I believe so.  Marvel should make a comic book about the history of comic books. agent_2:Yeah. I think DC has done a few books including one on Batman. It's like about how one would become Batman or something.  agent_1:Interesting.  Did you know there are over 300 registered superheroes just in the United States?	agent_2:Wow I didn't know that. But that makes sense! I think there are 30 superhero movies set to be released between 2016-2020.
7927	agent_2:It is weird.  Why were Ryan concerned about its donors not contributing $$?  He was going to leave anyway. agent_1:It's all about having the funds/access to funds.  agent_2:for the republican party in general?  	agent_1:Yes. The republican party needs donors so they can properly campaign. I guarantee that the Democrats will get a bit of pool money this year to campaign. We saw this in the 2018 midterm elections.
126691	agent_2:Yes.  lol  New York's area code is 212 because it was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone. agent_1:Yeah, the new yorkers got lucky on that one. i bet the people in alaska got the slowest one. LOL agent_2:LOL  The cables carrying phone and internet data across the oceaons are only 2.7 inches in diameter and just lay on the ocean floor.  That's a lot of cable!	agent_1:Yes, i guess that is why it needs to be so thing. it is incredibly long and must cost a long per meter.
135228	agent_1:It was a horror movie that came out recently, but youtube pulled the movie ad from the website just because they believed it was too scary. lol what do you think? agent_2:Ohh, I  see.  By any chance, did you know that google bought youtube for 1.65 billiions in 2006 agent_1:I knew they bought them in 2006 but thats dirt cheap compared to how much they make off of it now. wow.	agent_2:I concur.  It was so cheap that I wish I bought a share of youtube.  Hahaha
30879	agent_1:I haven't listened to either. South Korea responded to North Korea sinking a warship by blasting k-pop across the border. agent_2:that is an odd response. But I guess it's better than war. Millions could do if NK started firing. agent_1:I agree. It appears most k-pop stars are modeled for years in bootcamps before they can sign under contracts.	agent_2:I do not envy them. It sounds like an awful life. Everyone else makes money except you.
57195	agent_1:Correct. Netflix and youtube together,  agent_2:that makes sense. netflix has like 50 million subscribers. i bet that number is only going to grow too. agent_1:That is just in the US. They have 137 million total subscribers. 	agent_2:i bet that there are tons of companies out there that want to get in on that market. i wonder if there is an upstart out there that will dethrone netflix.
2369	agent_2:What happened? agent_1:I let him be and just watched him slither through my backyard agent_2:Was it a big one?	agent_1:It appeared as so to me. I stayed far away from him because of how big he was.
149954	agent_1:Maybe. I find it crazy that during a high school game, a science building was burning down. The game did not stop at all.  agent_2:That is crazy.  agent_1:Well, let us think about it. If there is a fire that came out of nowhere, wouldn't everybody be walking out of the school in a single file line to the parking lot? Wouldn't that be safer than just continuing a game?	agent_2:Yes I agree it would be safer.
74258	agent_2:Yes they were.  The first computer algorithm was written by a woman named Ada Lovelace.  I never knew that. agent_1:She was a bright person. I think there is a programming language named after her. Ada? agent_2:You might be right.  I guess she would be considered a celebrity then?	agent_1:In a way, a celebrity among programmers. If she were alive, she could see the secret room at Pixar.
44189	agent_1:I agree! I would definitely ride it haha. Have you ever traveled around the world? The first king to travel around the world was the king of Hawaii agent_2:I didn't know that. No, I haven't. Apparently years ago sailors would release rabbits on islands to provide future food.  agent_1:That is kind of interesting. Have you ever been to Iceland by the way? They don't have a real service, so they actually just take planes between some of the major towns, that's very wild haha	agent_2:No, I have no reason to visit there. That's pretty crazy, so like they fly everywhere?
16326	agent_2:haha ya his name was Lou Ferrigno, and he actually appeared in one of the avengers movies! agent_1:Oh yeah, I sort of remember that. How cool! I am into reading the Marvel comics too and really enjoy all the characters and the themes. In 1998 marvel offered the rights to sony for all the characters for $25 million but they only wanted Spiderman for $10 million because they claimed thats the only one people would care about. agent_2:haha that's funny! did you know the guy who plays jarvis's voice? I guess he has never watched an avengers movie haha	agent_1:Noway, what a trip! How would you someone not watch their own work? I am big on watching them with Netflix. Netflix is fast and has super bandwidth.
140766	agent_1:That is amazing actually. do you know how cadillac got its name? agent_2:Something to do with a explorer who founded Detroit I believe  agent_1:Yeah that is it antoine de la mothe	agent_2:I wonder if they sell flame thrower equipped cadillacs in South Africa since it is legal to mount flamethrowers onto cars there
77757	agent_1:Oh nice,  the Phillippines is beautiful but also very rural in a lot of places,  the beaches are amazing! No where is that island? agent_2:Yes it's in Michigan actually. Which is where I'm from. They don't allow cars on the island, they only allow horses and horse-drawn buggies. I'm allergic to horses so I just smelled horse poop and was sneezing the whole time LOL agent_1:Oh man,  that kinda sucks.  Maybe next time u can ride a bike or something.  Riding a horse makes my legs sore though,  I dont know how people use to travels days on horses. 	agent_2:I don't know. It seems like a lot of hassle to me. Did you know that the first King to travel the world was actually the King Hawaii? king kalakaua, I wonder what made him want to do that.
93680	agent_2:I've heard of the movie. It was really good! So there is a book? agent_1:Yes, they say its suggested for many military organizations and the US marine corps. I'll have to find it and watch then. agent_2:I'd like to read the book.  Normally I just sit and read but there is an elementary school that has kids reading on bicycles.  Supposedly it has helped the kids learn and improve their test scores.	agent_1:Oh really! On bikes and reading at the same time. I think I would have a hard time seeing the words while pedaling back and forth. How comfortable could the seats be.
98161	agent_2:Yeah isn't that crazy, but I guess it's all just a popularity contest when it comes to election time.  agent_1:I guess it is better than the alternative of a dictatorship or a military regime.  agent_2:Oh yeah way better than that would ever be so I'm happy but always room for improvement, we have lots of room here to be honest. 	agent_1:Especially since the two major parties have controlled the country for the last 160 years.
89169	agent_1:Well, he sure has the bucks. He has a $90 million contract with Nike that he got after declining a $10 million offer from Reebok. agent_2:That was definitely a smart move. He knew he would be worth more. People paid a lot of money just to attend his high school games. agent_1:I have heard that tickets for some games were selling for $100-$120!	agent_2:Yeah that's crazy! Reggie miller was a good player in high school as well.
152326	agent_2:Oh, interesting! Well, I am a terrible thrower so I'm out and i would run like im scared to get hurt. I wish I was a good left hander though, like Kellen Moore, he is the only left handed quarterback in the NFL. I wonder how many people he throws off when he throws the ball, that is until they become familiar that he is left handed.  agent_1:It's surprising that he's the only one! I've never heard of him. I wonder who he plays for? I wonder if he was at the NFL honors this year? That seems to have been a who's who of luminaries. Still not sure why the Rams coach won, but the NFL works in mysterious ways. agent_2:He plays for Dallas Cowboys. Nice chatting with you! Take care :) 	agent_1:Have a good one! It's been a pleasure!
92472	agent_2:Yes a coach at U of Kansas, James Naismith agent_1:Yes and he was also the only losing coach there agent_2:Ironically yes. Coaches are the highest paid employees in many states though	agent_1:That us true. Have you heard of the highest court in the land?
159259	agent_2:I knew there were a lot, but I don't think I knew the exact number. That makes sense though with how it's separated between the NFC and AFC agent_1:Yes.  To increase TV revenue they added a bye week for each team so there are 17 weeks for each team to play 16 games.  More TV revenue. agent_2:That makes sense though. The Super Bowl is a big deal and is one of the most watched sporting events of the year	agent_1:It usually is on the first Sunday of February, just like it was last week-end.
37144	agent_1:yes, i guess if the movie did badly, they would blame it on the fact that the director was a woman. it is a double standard. agent_2:i wonder who creates the toy ideas for it more, men or women. the toy industry gets involved with the toys before they even start the animation on the film. agent_1:yes, the movie becomes a marketing springboard. it was like that so much when i was young. Anyway, great chat!	agent_2:yes thank you for chatting. have a good night.
91376	agent_1:Maybe way back in the day. It must've been the 70s or early 80s. agent_2:That's funny because even back in the 80s Steve Martin looked middle aged.  I guess it's the white hair.  He looks exactly the same now LOL agent_1:That's true. Well, it's been great chatting with you about this stuff!	agent_2:You too!
69890	"agent_1:the programmers must have been pretty good about memory usage. that is a tight space. i assume that the commputer did not run on water. agent_2:Yes, that Russian water computer sounds unique, I wondered myself how it worked. Are you much of a computer person? I have a Data Science degree and have done some programming, but thankfully didn't smoke. Crazy that would void the Apple warranty making it a ""bio-hazard"". agent_1:you have a degree in data science? where did you get it? has it helped you get a job? I think that the hipster apple users would want to vape. can they do that?"	agent_2:No, it actually was a advance my career at the same company I worked out. I do a lot of reporting and data crunching now I wouldn't have done before and higher pay, I got it at Penn State distance. Along with the 1 MEG on the shuttle, you see where an iPhone has more computing power than the entire US ICBM deterrent. That is scary.
61786	agent_2:Yeah 324 concerts in just a year, that is a lot of concerts, I bet it was really demanding agent_1:I bet it was.  The Ramones have done 2,263 of them basically touring non stop for over 20 years. agent_2:That must also be really demanding thats 113 concerts a year for 20 years straight, a lot of money though, 	agent_1:True. Unless the band is Creed. They got sued for a bad concert.
70484	agent_2:I watch it all the time. Do you? agent_1:I love watching it, which is your favorite team? agent_2:I am a cubs fan. You?	agent_1:I am a white sox fan, uh oh! Lol!
23883	"agent_1:Since I could open my eyes ;) lol agent_2:Well did you know The ""A Wrinkle in Time"" director will reportedly direct the film version of ""New Gods,"" one of DC Comics' most cherished properties? agent_1:New Gods ? I'm sorry what is that... was there a comic book like that ? Or will it be something like... a mix of superheroes ?"	agent_2:It looks like a mix of superheroes. A lot besides superman and batman.
42204	agent_1:Yes that would be the unexpected Pakistan agent_2:Yeah. Do you know why the trumpeters grow goatees? agent_1:Yes it s more comfortable for them to play	agent_2:Do you like Drake?
94613	agent_2:I can only think of 6 gender options top, but 58 seems like an unreal number, well a lot of people out there with different gender identity agent_1:Yeah, i guess FB gets a lot of requests for new genders. they want to cater to people to keep them on the site. Gender? what does that even mean now? agent_2:that's an interesting question and I don't really have an answer, do you find the universe interesting?	agent_1:I do find the universe interesting. it is quite big and getting bigger. how old is it? who knows.
17863	agent_1:What are you interested in? agent_2:I like the classics but not country, more of the rock classics agent_1:Do you know that Bellamy holds the guiness work record for smashing guitars?	agent_2:how many?
92921	agent_1:possibly, i have no clue either agent_2:Maybe something to look up at a later time lol  agent_1:yeah it would be an interesting read	agent_2:have you ever looked at the white house on google maps?  apparently you can see barak obama lol
24606	agent_1:I think it's great. agent_2:Well Canada is the only country in the world with two national sports Lacrosse and Ice Hockey. agent_1:Interesting, both are really cool But hockey is better, I guess they couldn't decide!	agent_2:Very interesting.   One time a hockey player was traded for $1 in 1993 and won four Stanley Cups.
113269	agent_2:Hard to believe that failed 10 episodes in while Pokemon has filmed over 750 episodes which is basically 50 episodes for 16 consecutive years.  agent_1:Yeah, that is crazy. even crazier is that I've never once seen it. But I've played Pokemon Go.  agent_2:I haven't seen a Pokemon episode either. Maybe I can catch it on Netflix though? I mean between Netflix and YouTube, they account for half the peak internet traffic in north America so I'm sure they have some episodes of Pokemon.	agent_1:Yeah, that is crazy, from 9-12 they account for 33%.
44123	agent_2:Yes, I love it just because it reminds me of my childhood. That is how we lived in that time. Lots of imagination and kids taking off in groups having adventures.  agent_1:Yes, we used to watch it outside when we were camping. It was fun. We used to travel a lot as kids. All of Japan tolls costed over $300 to travel across the country. agent_2:That sounds like fun. Make sure you keep an eye on your garden gnomes. I hear people are having fun taking them on trips and then returning them with photos of their adventures. 	agent_1:HAHA! Yeah, I did notice those lil guys in different places than I left them.
95663	agent_1:Wow! That's a lot of jobs.  agent_2:Yep. Do you watch SNL at all? Weekend update is their longest running skit agent_1:I watch from time to time. I miss the classic actors. I like SouthPark. I know when they aired their last episode of Family Guy producers got flowers from the Simpson's crew.	agent_2:Yea, that was a great episode. I'm surprised Shakespeares The Two Noble Kinsmen has never been adapted for film or tv
124832	agent_2:Whoa...did not know that.  Did you know Fox news tried to sue the Simpsons for being anti democratic? agent_1:Well, that is fox news for you. News channels are having an effect on what politicians are doing. I do not think that that is good. agent_2:The average age pf a fox viewer is 68!	agent_1:68? That is very old. Did you know that there is 3g of cellphone service at the peak of mt. everest? I wonder why is that.
121362	agent_1:Yes, he apparently has a decent sense of humor as well; his SpaceX shot a cheese wheel into space as a shout out to a Monty Python sketch.   agent_2:that is awesome, i never knew that! How about presidents, you a trump fan? agent_1:He's probably better than some presidents we've had, and worse than others.  I think all presidents have a tough job.  Being the head of our government isn't something that I would want to do.  	agent_2:I will agree with that. At least he isn't one of the three wealthiest of all time, I think he would talk about it
22683	"agent_1:Yeah, it really depends on the day here. I was driving around yesterday with my Jeep top open. Did you know that hiccups are a holdover from early evolution when early land animals had both gills and lungs? agent_2:I've heard it hasn't something to do with early land animals having both gills and lungs but I've also read that it's a reflex from being a baby too agent_1:Yeah, i""m not sure if I really believe that about the evolution aspect. My understanding is things just get out of sync internally."	agent_2:Yea, I wonder what evidence they have that hiccups occur because of having both lungs and gills, seems impossible to test that
194	agent_2:Or have evolved into other species. The shark has a higher core temperature than other fish because it is an active swimmer. agent_1:That makes sense. I always thought sharks were pretty interesting because they have cartilage instead of bone. agent_2:Yes, fascinating fact! Tuna also hold a higher core temperature. They are in the same class as shark because they are also active swimmers.	agent_1:Tuna can get quite large, too. It's cool how big some fish get.
100524	agent_2:I didn't know that Jerry Seinfeld was so rich! He has a net worth roughly $820,000,000.more than Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise combined! agent_1:Wow, that is a crazy amount, I wonder what he did to earn so much more than those guys.   agent_2:The TV show has residuals. He was producer, creator, and actor, and got money for all three. In 2007 Tom Cruise spent $10 million on an underground bunker to protect himself from aliens. What?	agent_1:Yeah I guess when you add it up for both people and subtract what they spend as well, like money for a bunker then you get what you get.
32945	agent_1:A bus going 160 mph would scare me I think.  Have I traveled with a gnome... like where people take pictures of the gnome in various places?  I've never done that, have you? agent_2:No.  I think gnome travel sounds like fun.  I have also never crashed on a strangers couch.  It seems odd.  agent_1:Couchsurfing I have not done... back in the day when AirBnB first came out I tried that and felt super edgy, but now it's pretty normal.	agent_2:So you have AirBnB.  That is interesting.  Just think that back in the day people released rabbits onto islands to provide food for future travelers.  Screw up the island eco system and travel in style.
157676	agent_1:I listen to an easy listening station on my commute, to and from work.  I try to keep myself calm, the traffic where I live is horrible. agent_2:The traffic where I live is horrible as well.  Luckily I don't have to commute into the traffic.  I like easy listening as well!  I'm a serious nerd about radio technology though! agent_1:Really, how so?	agent_2:Did you know that radio carries information on the waves by just slightly modulating their amplitude.  Amplitude is just the size of the wave like in the ocean.  The radio station number is just a frequency of wave.
122324	agent_2:It took the secret Service 4 days to realize that the white house had been shoot up.  agent_1:What?! That's terrifying. How is that possible with so much secret service? agent_2:I have no idea, but it is scary!! This happened in November of 2011, oddly on the 11th. 	agent_1:Wow! That's insane. Unfortunately, the voter torn out in US presidential elections has not been above 62.8% in the last 100 years. People really should vote and it's sad that they don't.
80520	"agent_2:To look for itineraries or to help me budget or? agent_1:Booking, budget, or just dreaming.  With the internet, you can always take a ""virtual vacation"" should you not have the time or resources to travel.  They even have cell and internet service on top of Mount Everest.  So, if you ever get there, you can send me a email with a photo attachment as proof!!! agent_2:Haha, I think I shall hope to travel to my bucketlist destinations in real life, but you're right, without the funds, I can only enjoy a virtual vacation! I don't think I'll survive those harsh climates and those altitudes! "	agent_1:Same here.  The internet has also really transformed shopping.  I dislike walking stores and travelling from one store to another to compare.  So, I can comparison shop from the comfort of my living room.  Did you know that about 7% of people read the contact terms when buying online?
97817	agent_1:Correct. The other two were Jefferson and JFK. Were you also aware that the President's guest house is larger than the white house? agent_2:Yes, got to have thick walls to contain the Trump.  The last US president to speak a foreign language was FDR. agent_1:Ha ha. I did not know that either. It would be helpful to have more who had spoken a foreign language. I am shocked that until 1805 the runner up became the VP. That would made Hillary Clinton the VP now and I can't imagine them working together. 	agent_2:It seems a rule from a different time.  I find it weird that the first president photographed for his inauguration was Lincoln.  But there is an odd thing about the photo...
37286	agent_2:You know I'm not sure if that is a high amount or not. I have not traveled much by land so I can not be sure how it compares. What do you think? agent_1:I think it's very expensive especially considering that Japan is super small. Especially compared to United States, you can travel from Ohio to Pennsylvania for only about $10 in tolls agent_2:Yea that is a big difference. Like you mentioned it is a much smaller place.	agent_1:Yes I agree. What do you think about dogs by the way? I like them way more than cats
30823	agent_2:I've never heard of that before. How exactly would that work, do you think? agent_1:I think the same as humans but how would they stay still ? agent_2:Yeah, that would definitely be interesting. And I'm not sure who it would be helping. Dogs seem to be more like humans than we realize. Did you know that some dogs in Moscow have learned to use the subway?	agent_1:interesting. I would love to see that on you tube
115174	agent_1:I did not buy that album but I do like Linkin Park.  It is surprising to learn that they have the best selling album since 2000.  It's also surprising to learn that Pink Floyd's dark side of the moon was one of the best selling albums in 2014.  Their music is timeless.  agent_2:Certainly is. I listen to them all the time on the radio/ agent_1:I need to hear this rap album made by the two twins from Japan at 100 years old.  Sounds hilarious.  I am learning a lot about Japan today!	agent_2:I hope to be able to speak still at that age!
129309	agent_1:Amazing how far the internet has come since '69, some would say for the detriment of decent society.  Facebook has lost it's shine for me, not because of the nut jobs, but because it no longer interests me...  agent_2:I'm not a big fan of Facebook. I think the current obsession with social media is a kind of mass insanity. agent_1:I think if you combine the internet with the current political climate in America, you have this mass insanity you speak of.  Then target the irrational with fake news to get them ginned up - here we go!	agent_2:that sounds like a perfect plan. the masses ache to be frothed up into a frenzy. they get their wish. the internet seas roil with phony controversy. how can i profit?
95494	agent_2:Good to know! The american team has never placed below third place in the world cup since women's world cup started in 1991 agent_1:Hope Solo was a real hero as goal keeper for about 3 world cup competitions.  Soccer fans go crazy in some countries. agent_2:Did you know Soccer makes more money than football, basketball, baseball, golf, tennis and hockey combined.	agent_1:That is amazing.  I know that the value of some UK soccer teams is higher than the value of the NY Yankees.
146427	agent_2:Yes, football is my favorite sport. My favorite team is the new York giants, do you like football? agent_1:Did you know that circular huddle was created for a deaf quarterback so the other team could not read the quarterback's hand signals agent_2:No I didn't know, that is great information, thanks for sharing. Did you know the quarterback is usually the leader of the offensive team? 	agent_1:Yeah, they are the most important players of the team.  Did you know that Kellan Moor is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl
96765	agent_2:Yes Google bought the gmail.com domain from Garfield actually, so Garfield was originally using that for there emailing Services haha agent_1:interesting, i just thought they came up with it agent_2:Nope apparently not, also I didn't know that Michael Jackson tried to buy Marvel Comics, he wanted to make a Spider-Man movie where he plays Peter Parker LOL	agent_1:ha funny, nice chatting
86304	agent_2:Yes I love basketball. It looks like Carmelo's leaving the OC Thunder. agent_1:I gather that he didn't spend much time there.  Do you think he'll land on some other team for very long? agent_2:Well it looks like he's going to Atlanta for the draft, but he's already 34 so where ever he goes, he's aging.	agent_1:Is 34 old for the NBA?  Do you think that's why his style is more of a catch and shoot scorer?  It sounds like a lot less running.
41766	agent_1:Did you know that Air Jordan's were banned upon introduction by the NBA? However, Jordan were them anyways, as Nike was willing to pay the fine each game.  agent_2:Yeah I think I have read that.  Nike got the best marketing they ever could so I'm sure they were happy to pay! agent_1:I bet they were too. Shoe companies have a way spending money on their investments. Allen Iverson signed a lifetime deal with Reebok in 2001. He'll get $800,000 a year until he's 55. 	agent_2:I bet they are wishing they could take that back.  I think that they thought they were signing the next Jordan.
27429	"agent_2:I'm going to have to look that up.  Sounds interesting.  The javanese alphabet when recited in order forms a poem. agent_1:That's pretty cool. Demetri Martin wrote a 224 word palindrome poem once. agent_2:That sounds impressive!  Edgar Allen Poe only received $9 for the publication of his poem ""The Raven"""	agent_1:Interesting to know. Did you know Lion King was the first Disney film to be dubbed into Zulu for its African release?
142152	agent_1:The surface of the sun is cooler than the interior. if we could just harness that lightning!  agent_2:The sun produces enough energy in one second to meet the needs of the entire planet for 500,000 years agent_1:If we could just capture all that energy and store it somewhere!	agent_2:Yeah exactly,  like a better version of the solar panel.
74197	agent_2:when two twins in Japan turned 100 they released a rap album.  agent_1:Thats amazing. Probably just a publicity stunt to make some money, but its pretty creative. agent_2:NWA's album straight outta Compton did not have airplay or a major tour when it reached platinum status	agent_1:I was never an NWA fan. I like some rap. Just never NWA. Maybe they were a little ahead of my time.
82774	agent_2:Hello A! Are you a fan of Best Buy? I feel like I hardly buy thing sat Best Buy anymore, but apparently they have a service that offers unlimited technical support for an annual fee of $199, would you pay for something like that? agent_1:Howdy! I don't mind Best Buy its always kind of fun just to browse even though I don't plan on buying anything, I think that $200 seems high, I wouldn't buy it. For some people who are not very good with technology probably well worth it. agent_2:I agree, I'm guilty of the same thing. One time, I did stumble upon some GoPro accessories at a massive discount so I purchase those from there. $200 is very expensive, it's almost enough to buy something new in the electronics department!	agent_1:It doesn't seem like too much if you think of it like a monthly service, only like $16 over 12 months. Seems like something if you used it alot could really get your moneys worth.
31974	agent_1:Really? That's pretty cool. They definitely seem to have it all figured out and growing and growing, I don't pay for Prime but I guess if I want to watch sports in the future or watch a baseball game I will have to join lol...I heard also that IMBD is owned by Amazon...didn't know that! agent_2:I hope Disney does not agree to sell.  They are a much better organization.  Did you know that Frozen was the first animation directed by a woman? agent_1:I agree! But there are other companies who want to buy this Disney Broadcasting Network so bidding is just in the first stages. I love Disney though, and no I didn't know that! I like how the toy industry gets involved in Disney films prior to even before starting the production.	agent_2:True, but who can outbid Amazon, lol.  Yes, I have seen movie toys being sold before the movie even comes out a lot.
138708	agent_1:That is very interesting, did you know that Teddy Roosevelt banned Christmas trees while he was there? agent_2:I did not know that. I learned that because of crowding Teddy Roosevelt had all work offices relocated to the new West Wing in 1901. agent_1:That is true, did you know that the white house still uses floppy discs for computers?	agent_2:Wow! That technology seems so ancient. It seems like the opposite of George W. Bush putting solar panels on the White House.
94950	agent_1:Nice I like that too. Did you ever watch the SImpsons? agent_2:I sure did, Did you know Homer had 188 jobs in the first 400 episodes? agent_1:Wow that is a lot. THere is an episode where Bart does not appear	agent_2:Hmm interesting. Do you ever watch Shark Tank?
105154	agent_1:Hello do you watch fox news? agent_2:Hey I don't have cable, but I have watched Fox News before, I try not to watch news in general though what about you agent_1:I could take it or leave it.  Did you know that Richard Nixon partially helped to create Fox news?  I didn't know that.	agent_2:Oh I didn't know that, Richard Ailes also helped, have you ever visited the website ign.com? Thats owned by Fox News too
132891	agent_1:I preferred South Park.    The Simpsons crew sent them flowers after they aired their Family Guy parody! agent_2:haha I love that episode, did you see that in teh first 400 simpsons episodes home had like 200 different jobs haha agent_1:I did not know that.   I did know Mr. Conductor was played by three famous people! 	agent_2:no what show is that? I did know that soap operas are called that because they were always sponsored by soap producers ahah
130829	agent_1:Oh yeah! Gisele! I wonder how she makes all that money! agent_2:She must have so many modeling contracts!  Maybe Tom is hurt by that and it's why Belichick lists him in the injury report ever week! Haha agent_1:Tom Brady had never thrown 30 touchdown passes in a season prior to 2007. that year he threw a record 50!	agent_2:I know a lot of people started the steroid discussion after that season.  I wonder if there is any truth in that...
155877	agent_2:Yes, but it would be fun to see if they did. Have you heard about the $3 million baseball card find? agent_1:Yes it would. Oh those cards hidden since the 1940s? How cool would that be to stumble upon. Thanks grandpa!! agent_2:No kidding! Are you a football fan? With 32 NFL teams it is always on at my house.	agent_1:Oh yeah me too! Always a good game to watch and I love it. Even though there is only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay.
140909	agent_1:Interesting! Apparently 1886 was the birth year of the modern car! agent_2:Wow! That's a long time! But not that long if you consider the amount of fossil fuel we've already used up! I guess Mcdonalds added drive-thrus in 1975 for soldiers who weren't allowed to get out of their cars while wearing fatigues. Interesting! agent_1:Interesting indeed! I thought drive throughs were meant for lazy people!	agent_2:Yeah, and here it turns out it was initially intended for people that are working, and to protect our country nonetheless! I guess these days, they are for lazy people. Haha, me included!
161293	agent_1:Yeah. Do you like Jim Carrey? agent_2:I love him. Do you know why he does not do drama anymore?	agent_1:Yes he thinks that they do not portray positivity
101119	agent_1:Oh there is one, I did not know that. WHo is that? agent_2:It is Matt Patricia and he went to a school that had all the fun math names in its title agent_1:Nice. Did you know engineers make more over the lifetime than the players?	agent_2:I guess it makes sense since their careers are longer too
104743	agent_2:I thought they were colorblind too. I guess that they see some colors, which makes sense. they have great ears and noses too. agent_1:Apparently they can see as many colors as we can. Do you think that's true? agent_2:that sounds funny. it think the visual cortex of humans is far more developed. maybe we have been resolution? i dont know.	agent_1:Ah, that could be right! In Istanbul you can get food for strays by recycling bottles at a vending machine. Pretty interesting.
54341	agent_2:It is interesting they are the most valuable retailer but not the most valuable public company. They come in third after Apple and Microsoft. I wonder where Walmart would end up on that list. agent_1:Amazon is like the sun to our economy.  Did you know the sun is actually white? agent_2:I did not know that. I just learned that lightening bolt is hotter than the sun by 5 times. So someone who has been struck by lightening knows what it is like to be on the sun time five.	agent_1:It is no wonder some people don't survive getting struck.  The sun produces enough energy in one second to meet the needs of the entire planet for 500,000 years!
146665	agent_2:That's an interesting name.  Never heard of that (or form of that) for a guy.  His dad was in the NFL too right?  Archie I think? agent_1:Yes, and he's also got an older brother Peyton Manning who was also a NFL quarterback. Cool family, right? agent_2:Yeah! Peyton's considered by many to be one of the greatest passers ever!	agent_1:Plus, Eli is not only a great quarterback, but I hear he's got an IQ considered to be genius.
93881	agent_1:Yeah, I agree! I have a Dodge and it's super solid. I feel really safe in it. I like some Cadillac designs. Cadillac was named after French explorer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac. He founded Detroit. agent_2:Oh yes, and Detroit is the motor city? Or motor car city? lol I forgot exactly what the name is but it has to do with cars, right? agent_1:Hmm, not sure. I wonder if Cadillac made cars back when cars had wooden trunks on the back.	agent_2:I think so. I am pretty sure my grand parents had one. My Grandfather even pulled a boat with his Cadillac. lol I think I'm going to go fishing now, ttyl!
61176	agent_2:Do you think Facebook will still be popular and relevant 5-10 years from now, or do you think something else will take its place? agent_1:Facebook will probably still be around, they are always buying potential competitors websites, too bad Myspace didn't do the same when it could of bought facebook for 75 million agent_2:It's funny you mentioned MySpace... I actually enjoyed using MySpace way more than Facebook.  I was pretty loyal until about 2010 when everyone finally left.  Did you ever use MySpace?	agent_1:Yea back when I was in High School, I liked the experience better than facebook. I stopped using it in 2005 though, right when Myspace could of bought facebook
147660	agent_1:I'm wondering if President Macron's plan to put the public at ease by bringing up Europe's dark past has backfired. Perhaps talking about past problems has caused too much public fear. agent_2:I think its a start at least I agree with him, we need a strong Europe, the thing is how many of the guests will agree with his point fo view agent_1:I think President Macron is on the right track when he talks about how political integration and populist tribalism can help keep Europe peaceful and prosperous. 	agent_2:One thing is certain, Im thankful Nicolas Maduro isnt our leader,
99816	agent_1:In America, it seems like it is better to be the guest than the President. The guest house is larger than the White House. agent_2:I would think that the White House is old and build to a past set of standards.  Want to hear something funny about Lincoln and Booth? agent_1:Sure. I like fun facts. I do know that Booth assassinated Lincoln.	agent_2:Right.  the funny thing is Lincoln was the first president to be photographed for his inauguration.  The weird thing is Booth was in that photo.  We cant throw a rock without a cell phone photo today.
39081	agent_1:Yeah, I think he was in that. I know he started his rap career as a backup dancer.  agent_2:Oh nice. Bruce Lee was also a great dancer apparently. agent_1:Yeah, none of that surprises me. It's all about agility. 	agent_2:Yeah true. He even won a championship in 1958.
30535	agent_1:Yes, those guys play so well together! the splash brothers. anyway, great chat! agent_2:Nice talking to you! agent_1:Yes, i enjoyed chatting! Have a good day!	agent_2:Have a good one!
70098	agent_1:Yeah it does indeed. I like reading about these interesting facts. Do you like reading as well? It provides a good escape.  agent_2:I do like reading!  I still like to hold a book in my hand and flip the pages.  The world record for speed reading is held by Anne Jones.  She read 4,700 words per minute.  That translates to a lot of books! agent_1:Holy cow. That is lightning fast. Reading is powerful, it actually caused a moral panic back in the 18th century. 	agent_2:Wow.  I didn't know that.  Starship Troopers is the first sci-fi novel on the reading lists of 3 of the 5 US military branches.  I never read that book.  Wonder if it's like the movie?
62755	agent_1:Well, I would not be surprised at that either. Who has the time to read through 10 pages of conditions?  agent_2:I agree! Some scientist should do research on how annoying it is haha. agent_1:Speaking of scientists, the emperor of Japan is a scientist who still publishes papers!	agent_2:That is interesting! I feel like there should be a lot more scientists in charge of society! There was one scientist who walked the moon!
87019	agent_1:Hello!  Are you a fan of country music? agent_2:Hi! Yes, but do you agree that people should refer to Country Music as also hillbilly music? agent_1:LOL  No.  That's funny.  George Strait and Jeff Bezos are cousins.  That's something I never knew before.	agent_2:Yeah I agree! Wow, they really are? I wonder if George Strait's albums are promoted on Amazon site, do you know?
110795	agent_1:I have not heard about that. I'll have to look into that. Did you watch the president's state of the union on Tuesday? agent_2:I did not. Was not interested in anymore demands for a wall agent_1:Haha I understand. You would be happy to know that is pretty much all that was talked about in depth so you did not miss much. 	agent_2:It is crazy to think that we had to shutdown the government for that. And congress did not stop it. I hope we get some more work done before the end of the 3 weeks
133657	agent_1:Yeah that is true. Have you heard of the highest court in the land? agent_2:Yes that is in the top floor of the US supreme court agent_1:Yeah and I wonder how many people really get to play there	agent_2:good point. Do you know what the NZ team is nicknamed?
163201	agent_2:Yeah surprising. Looks like JFK, Washington, and Jefferson take the cake! agent_1:I wonder who the President was that decided the guest house should be bigger than the white house itself? agent_2:Yeah I would like to know more about that as well. I also want to her the Indonesian president's pop albums lol.	agent_1:Me too. I think he has 3 albums that have been released!
148670	"agent_2:lol, you're funny. In my case I was the little brother who used to get taken advantage off. Let's just say ""I am no Troy Aikman"" Do you have preference for a football team. I love Dallas Cowboys - well I went to school in Texas! agent_1:Uh oh, Eagles fan here!  But my aunt loved the cowboys.  Did you know that ESPN won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow line for first downs in American football? agent_2:Eagles!!! I won't hold it against you!! Yeah Auntie!! Wow, that innovation by ESPN was something - for me it was always there and I never really thought about it but it absolutely makes a lot of sense. That was a good call. For me another innovation that springs to mind is the Video Referee that we have now a days that allows instant playback of a game. I love living in the age of such great technology. I think that it makes sports so much the more interesting. What do you think? "	agent_1:It's good and bad.  As always those who cannot afford it can never progress to a competitive level.  So at my high school, I think the football team used the money for their budget and took away from student and other budgets to keep up to have some good players.   But some of them probably ended up playing with Green-Ellis who never fumbled.
33528	agent_1:True, although In the military, hats may denote nationality, branch of service, rank or regiment. agent_2:Yes, many can be very distinctive, such as those worn by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. agent_1:True.   Police also use headgear such as peaked caps or brimmed hats.	agent_2:I personally like the Ushanka fur hat.  My father in law has one of those.  It's neat looking.
148830	"agent_2:no, i didnt. i know many of the actors went on to big careers. did you like that show? agent_1:I liked it.  A few of them went on to have big careers.  They remade it in the UK and called it ""Days like These"" but it failed after 10 episodes.  Ashton Kutcher was the biggest one to come out of it a star.  However, it did also have Chong (who was already famous from Cheech and Chong) in it. agent_2:Chong! Yes, i remember Chong. A remake in the UK? Hm. I cant see that working. Anyway, great chat!"	agent_1:It's been fun!  Have a great day!
131320	agent_2:That is really nice.  Did you know that there is only one episode in the Simpsons that bart neither appeared or mentioned.  agent_1:Never knew that! agent_2:Also the 70s show was remade verbatium in the UK. 	agent_1:Days like these was cancelled after 10 episodes
15655	agent_2:True. Personally I doubt it -- I suspect intelligent civilizations are so far apart that contact is pretty rare. But I really hope something like a faster-than-light drive is possible so we an meet each other. agent_1:That would be cool. Hopefully we find new planets soon 80 percent of earths forrest have been destroyed agent_2:Absolutely. I hope exploring the solar system and settling other planets is cheap enough to be feasible soon.	agent_1:Yea, earth has a lot of issue, it will be virtually helium-free by the end of the century
72156	agent_1:You and me both haha. Did you know Apple had a clothing line back in 1986? agent_2:I think they better stick with phones and pcs agent_1:I agree on that one. I wonder how long it lasted!	agent_2:Probably 1986 only lol.  A store in alabama sell lost clothing and camera from airports lasted longer
20521	agent_2:I like Golden State. I like steph curry. I do like LeBron. people say he betrayed cleveland, but i dont know what i would have done in his position. agent_1:I know I would have taken the money and set up kids and my grandchildren up for life. lol  Although when came back,  I didn't think he would leave again.  Oh well.  Did you know that Air Jordan's were banned by the NBA but Michael Jordan wore them anyhow because Nike was willing to pay the fine for each game?  It's been fun chatting with you! agent_2:Yeah, Nike got a bargain in my opinion. Great chatting!	agent_1:Have a great night!
92385	agent_2:That makes me not want to watch it at all, since I don't like horror in the first place. agent_1:How funny is this... Stephen King said the scariest movie he ever saw was Bambi!! agent_2:I watched Bambi when I was a child and I remember it being pretty scary! Apparently you can burn calories when watching scary movies though.	agent_1:Maybe that will be my workout regimen for 2019!
131524	agent_2:Sometimes I watch. Depends on the home team. And you?  agent_1:I love the sport. Who's your home team? I'm a Braves fan at heart. haha agent_2:I like DC, but grew up watching Bmore. 	agent_1:I was a big Ripken fan when I was a kid. He was in so many All Star games.
75614	agent_1:Yes i bet you they have some interesting stuff there agent_2:I bet so too. Apple even had a clothing line back in the day agent_1:Yes that was in 1986 but do not know what happened to it	agent_2:Me either. Rip Curl in north korea has clothes that say made in china
164234	"agent_1:I suppose so. ""We're winners, and we can do what we want."" Wait. That was NASCAR and Talladega Nights, not NFL. I find it hysterical someone was quoted as saying, ""Competitors last in this league"" speaking of The NFL. I thought NFL stood for ""Not For Long."" ?  agent_2:Maybe he can paint his room pink like the University of Iowa painted their visitor's locker room. agent_1:lol lol lol How much do pro bowlers make today? If they made more in the 60's than pro football players surely it's more than I'm making now.  I'm more into being lazy and I need/want a new job. Maybe I can take up bowling... "	"agent_2:Have you ever seen King Pin with Woody Harrelson. Everytime I see bowling on TV, I think to myself ""I'm in awe to be around so many great athletes..."" and giggle..."
96721	agent_2:That is interesting, I didn't realize the president even had a guest house! agent_1:Yes, they have so much space.Obama was the 44th president of the united states.  agent_2:I guess so.  Did you know a man who was falsely imprisoned for 10 years spent most of his time in the library to study law.  He was able to prove his innocence!	agent_1:Great use of time getting information from the library.
152293	agent_2:Yes, he's a good player aside from that. And yes, he's getting up there in years so maybe he will retire soon. He has won several Super Bowls. agent_1:He has won or lost more super bowls than any other quarterback I believe. All by 3 or 4 points in every try.  agent_2:And get this, when he was drafted it was later in the 6th round. Then he went on to surprise everyone by winning several games. He proved to them he was an excellent quaterback.	agent_1:He has got to be considered the greatest steal in any draft pick ever. 16 seasons has got to produce a lot of wear and tear on the body, I wonder how much time he has left.
31089	agent_1:Thanks! You too. agent_2:bye agent_1:See ya!	agent_2:Don't forget to complete your amazon order!
74000	"agent_2:True. But back in 1975... I think this idea was genious at this time. Absolutely not standard approach  agent_1:for sure, it took from 1908 to 1975 for someone to think that idea up! agent_2:I've also read that 5000 years old shoes perform better than modern shoes. And I'm wondering what do they mean by ""perform"" and why is it like this. "	agent_1:yeah i thought those shoes were just cloth pretty much... maybe they last longer?
54116	agent_2:I use it daily, what about you? agent_1:Me too. DO you know what the hamburger button is? agent_2:No, I am not familiar with it, what is that exactly?	agent_1:It is the three horizontal lines on the menu on apps
94810	agent_2:Yeah....he uses the subway...and i don't even live in Moscow agent_1:Ok, what about Moscow ? Do they have anything special with dogs, like Istanbul ? agent_2:Yeah..they take the subway there too. what's up with instanbul?	agent_1:They have vending machine that give food and water to stray dogs in exchange of empty water bottles.
76904	agent_1:Yes rotary phones took forever to make a phone call, so that was smart of them agent_2:Hard to imagine a time before any type of phones, now everyone carries a phone in their pocket! I can't believe how many iphones there have been since the first one. Who can keep up? agent_1:Right? Did you know the cables that carry phone and internet data are only 2.7 inches wide	agent_2:And they run along the ocean floor! That's amazing to me.
43970	agent_1:I do like it. You cand find it on youtube, it's Grandpa Kitchen. I hope Pixar will invite him to their secret room. agent_2:Yes, what's in that secret? If it really a secret room, why are we talking about it? That means it not very secret. It's called Grandpa Kitchen, I will look that up. I thought celebrities have been doing voice overs for years, did you know Robin Williams was the first in Aladdin? agent_1:Yes, I watched the tribute, and it was mentioned. It's cute that Pete Davidson named his baby pig Piggy Smallz	agent_2:Yes, a sense of humor there; though I thought it was he and Adriana's before the big break up. Be careful on the internet and pass the word, repeated clicking and novelty can be addictive.
23833	agent_1:Those are such great movies. Stephen King was scared of the movie Bambi when he was a child. agent_2:Haha. Well, he got revenge on the world for that didn't he? Apparently watching a horror movie burns 180 calories. I need to start the Wes Craven diet.  agent_1:Wow that's cool. I didn't know that. Definitely a good way to burn calories.	agent_2:Also if you watch a horror movie before you view abstract art you're supposed to enjoy the art more. Wonder who did the study to figure that out? Sounds like a studio gimmick.
73745	agent_2:Thats amazing. Ive learned a lot today agent_1:I did too! especially about instruments. agent_2:Yes Its been good talking to you.	agent_1:you as well
118325	agent_2:Yeah, the trains are a better way to go there. fast, comfortable and stylish.  agent_1:Speaking of trains, Iceland has no public rail service and most Icelanders without cars use domestic flights to travel between major towns. agent_2:I think the terrain in iceland is not suited to rail. if they have airports they have money. 	agent_1:Ah yeah I didn't think of it that way!
23440	agent_2:Now that sounds a lot more likely. How do you think they get away with that? agent_1:Apparently it's not just Target. Walmart, Walgreens, and even GNC, too. agent_2:That's terrible. You know I wouldn't want to work at Target. The world is dangerous enough without wearing a target on my back, don't you think?	agent_1:Haha. I wonder why they changed their name? It used to be Goodfellow Dry Goods.
269	agent_1:Sounds strange. I can't fathom why anyone would want a rat for a pet. I'm a little leery of guinea pigs and ferrets. anything with red eyes you can keep.   agent_2:Haha, yep. A snake doesn't seem very warm or comforting either. I don't understand why people enjoy having them as pets. And how do they find partners who accept it? agent_1:Other people who like that stuff i guess, haha. Apparently Theodore Roosevelt had 20 pets including a bear and Hyena. I wonder if he played with them much? 	agent_2:Well, President of the United States, I wonder if he had them in the White House? Did he have a stable for the bear out back?
151415	agent_2:Nope, I don't know any.  I guess being smart is where the money is.  They make more lifetime money than MLB players as well.   agent_1:Yep that's true. What do you think about the New England Patriots? They're based in the Boston area agent_2:Some people don't like them because they win so much, but I don't mind them.  Belichick is a pretty accomplished coach, even if he is slightly grumpy at times: 15 AFC East titles is nothing to sneeze at.	agent_1:Nope I agree. I like people who win haha. And I guess the Buffalo Bills are equal to the Patriots, in Super Bowl losses, that's kind of sad but you know not everyone can have Tom Brady on their team haha
133296	agent_2:Very strange. He is the first and only QB to reach 200 regular season wins.  agent_1:Tons of mystery here! The Patriots have either lost or won the Super Bowl by 3 or 4 points all 6 tries. agent_2:That's incredible. Did you know an average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay?	agent_1:I had heard that recently. I'm a little surprised. Or how about this...women are allowed to join, but must meet all of the eligibility requirements.
1	agent_2:Both are excellent technology they are helpful in many ways. For the security purpose both are super. agent_1:I'm not  a huge fan of Google, but I use it a lot because I have to. I think they are a monopoly in some sense.  agent_2:Google provides online related services and products, which includes online ads, search engine and cloud computing.	agent_1:Yeah, their services are good. I'm just not a fan of intrusive they can be on our personal lives.
55213	agent_1:Hello there, are you a big music fan? agent_2:Heck yeah. I listened to Nudes by Lucius early today. They are a pop folk duo . agent_1:That sounds interesting, I'm going to look them up quick.  I have been listening to Cut Worms debut album a lot this year, its pretty good. 	agent_2:Oh that is cool but I haven't heard of them so I'll check them out. I would love to attend the Art Walk in Portugal. They have street performers and many bands playing. Sounds fun.
85661	agent_2:I wonder who built it. It is hard enough for me to get internet in my backyard. agent_1:yeah lol some parts of my city in the hills have really bad internet.  But Everest is where you have to post selfies,,, so I guess it makes sense lol 7% of people read the full terms when buying a product or service on the internet agent_2:Good to know about the 7%.  I myself am to lazy to read terms on the internet.	agent_1:I read most of it.  definitely not all.
87813	agent_1:Yea but only 7% of people read the terms of service on the internet, they shouldn't be writing a constituion agent_2:They might as well be at the peak of mt. everest with 3g cell service. agent_1:Hopefully those are not saved in the Library of Aleandria's copy of the internet	agent_2:The Iceland constitution will be there.  Nice chatting wtih you
17918	"agent_1:Climate change is the more updated term for what used to be called ""global warming."" Canada is starting to put policies into place that they believe will help with the said issue, but most aren't sure why, it seems agent_2:I guess it's tricky. I would like to see some progress, but people seem reluctant to change. Plus, will it raise taxes? agent_1:It raises tax on anything that produces carbon, in most cases. Which includes gas, of course"	agent_2:In 1975 the Soviet Union successfully sent a spacecraft to Venus, and captured the first images from the surface of another planet. Did the colonists survive? Is there a secret base on Venus? Do they have to worry about climate change there? Maybe we should communicate with them about carbon taxes.
22258	agent_1:Do you like college basketball? agent_2:Sure. I even like college swimming.I especially like the race where the hands and feet are bound as they flop around like a dolphin  in the water. agent_1:I do not remember that stroke. I will have to look at it...	agent_2:Its called the Flipper crawl I think... LOL  The native Americans introduced the front crawl to the west. But their hands and feet were not bound.
75854	agent_2:I know Im excited for that game, the team has been playing so much better since Mourihno left, did you ever hear about the Whopper promotion that Burger King had on Facebook? agent_1:Yeah they really have, and it's just in time for today's game.  No, I didn't hear what was it? agent_2:So for every 10 people you unfriended you would get a free whopper, too bad I didnt know about that promotion, free burgers are my favorite	agent_1:Yeah that is pretty hilarious actually, I wonder how many friends got unfriended during that one?
148053	agent_1:He didn't change it, it's his middle name. Probably goes by it because he and his father share the same name. I bet that got confusing! agent_2:Oh I see. Akron, Ohio must have something in the water because both Lebron and Stephen Curry were born there! agent_1:GOAT in the water...makes sense! Although Curry is considered the best shooter of all time, I don't know why...do you?	agent_2:He is a dead eye from the three point land. So good. But he was once held scoreless!
128761	agent_2:did not know about that. do you know reggie miller? agent_1:Yes he is a phenomenal player, distinguished enough to be on the nba hall of fame right? agent_2:yeah and yes his siter kept beating him, she was amazing	agent_1:Maybe if he played shooting granny style, he may have gotten more points than his sister, although it looks stupid
65933	agent_2:Yeah, he's made quite a name for himself. Gene Wilder (who apparently wasn't such a big fan of Depp) refused to watch the remake of willy wonka for fear of being disappointed by him. agent_1:I never heard about that, Gene was so good, I am a bit surprised by that.  agent_2:I am too. Do you use Netflix?	agent_1:I don't have an account but think it is a very useful product.  How about you?
150628	agent_2:A little but not too much.  agent_1:New York's area code is 212 because it was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone. agent_2:That's very interesting. It's been a long time since I've seen a rotary phone. 	agent_1:Me too. I've actually never used one. Have you?
35313	agent_2:Is the Fender acoustic or electric? agent_1:It's an electric.  Black/white and gold plated agent_2:Very nice.  I can understand how Brian May could use British coins for guitar picks.  The coins are not all as stiff as US coins.	agent_1:Oh wow, I didn't realize.  Thanks for the chat.
151082	agent_2:Money always talks for most of them so it is hard to say. What about the Colts? Are you an Andrew Luck fan? agent_1:I tend to follow Pats and the Cowboys today but I have seen a lot of colts games. Are they still using Andrew Luck as their QB? agent_2:Yes he did miss the entire 2017 season with a shoulder injury. But has been pretty effective as of late.	agent_1:Well im glad he is doing better. I heard a rumor that Bill Belichick has more superbowl wins as a couch that any other coach in the NFL
41596	agent_2:I think it was a Canadian guy named Naismith. Is that right? agent_1:Yes you're right. He was the inventor and also the only losing coach in history of his university LOL like how is that possible, you think that the creator of basketball would be an amazing coach agent_2:I guess he was creative but not strategic. Maybe he had terrible players. Maybe he was a jerk. Who knows. Now the game has grown tremendously.	agent_1:It has definitely grown since then! For instance, in 39 out of 50 states, the highest state employee salary is either a basketball or football coach, kind of screwy
91387	agent_2:It definitely would have been interesting to have seen it! I would really like to see Beetlejuice though, curious how that will work out. Timbers seems to be very pleased with the production thus far. agent_1:Yeah, I wonder who they will get to play Winona Ryder's part, do you know?  agent_2:Sophie Ann Caruso I believe, it will be a big part! My choice of entertainment is comedy or Drama films so the Beetlejuice show would fit right into that for me.	agent_1:Hmm, I've never heard of her, what has she been in before?
79948	agent_2:Most definitely.  I read somewhere that a Creed concert was so bad that some concert attendees filed a lawsuit.  That must have been one bad concert? agent_1:I know! How bad does the experience have to be for you to sue the band? Maybe Pink Floyd had it right with his Pompeii concert with no audience.  agent_2:Yes, that must have been very strange for them to perform with no audience to give them any feedback or to clap when they finished.  These rockers are strange people!	agent_1:They really can be. I hope they recorded it though. It would be kind of nice to stream a concert without all the crowd noise in the background.
102662	agent_1:From the MLB? Why? I mean, even the managers can play. That's why they wear uniforms agent_2:Yeah I think it would be cool to see one have to bat one day.  And I guess the female player was banned after she struck out both Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig.  agent_1:That's pretty funny though. Babe Ruth lost the World Series in 1926 by one run after he was caught trying to steal the base. It was even game 7	agent_2:Wow, I never knew that baseball fact, very cool.  That must have been some game to be at!
127382	agent_1:Yeah I agree. He had some good ones. What do you think about Hugh Laurie? I know he was really good in house agent_2:he was great in House. He did a lot of comedy in the UK before coming to the US. He really does a great American accent. agent_1:I agree with you. It's shocking that he is actually British LOL. I'm glad he got paid a lot of money, he made almost $700,000 per episode	agent_2:I think that would be a bargain, since he is the star and the only reason that the show exists. He makes it work. He couldn't be replaced.
161744	agent_1:I wonder how the culture was back when radios were more simple. In WWII soldiers made radios out of just a razorblade and pencil. agent_2:I don't think radio technology has improved that much as far as amplitude. AM/FM stations still have really short range. A modest car trip and the local stations are already out of range. agent_1:At the same time, we can pick up radio storms from Jupiter, they are strong enough.	agent_2:Oh right I have heard of people who do that. I think maybe it's because the transmitters only send the radio waves short wave, where as the radio storms on jupiter are naturally occurring and everything there is massive.
113247	agent_2:Yeah, i used to be responsible for a lot of that usage LOL. it really is addictive. much better than TV. Blockbuster sure messed up years ago. agent_1:Yep, it's first mistake was charging Reed Hastings 40 dollars in late fees for Apollo 13 agent_2:Yeah, angry people can be determined to change the world. and build multibillion dollar firms. LOL	agent_1:Yep, if Blockbuster bought Netflix for 50 million there would be more than one store left today
140979	agent_1:Are you a reader? agent_2:Sort of. You? agent_1:BIG time reader!  It was my most fervent desire as a small child to learn to read as all the adults in my house did.  I particularly like sci-fi like Starship Troopers (required reading by military).	agent_2:I was more into sports as a kid and hated reading but now I regret that immensely.
35011	agent_2:I do remember him!  He's been retired a few years now.	agent_1:Yeah but apparently still making 800,000 a year from a deal with Reebok- crazy!
77385	agent_1:Linkin park was very popular, hybrid theory is the best selling album of the century so far agent_2:Another popular album is Dark Side of teh Moon. It was released more than 40 years ago but was still a best selling album in 2014. agent_1:Yea, Pink Floyd was pretty popular, they played in the roman ampitheater with no crowd back in the day though	agent_2:That is very eerie, but very cool. Speaking of ancient roman ampitheatres, there is one that is still used as a concert venue in Croatia.
94624	agent_2:Yes, I love Facebook and get on it everyday. Since Facebook has been around since 2004, I've had an account. agent_1:i have never had one. i know that it is a cool way to keep track of people but i worry about privacy and data usage. agent_2:I don't worry about that, I enjoy Facebook very much.  Burger King had a promotion where if you unfriend 10 people on Facebook you would get a free whopper.	agent_1:i would happily make and break friendship just to get a tasty meal. why should i have pride? free calories!
108522	agent_2:Yeah, big brains! I wouldn't mind taking a date bowling sometimes. A funny fact is that bowlers made twice as much as football team stars in the 19630's. Not so much now, thats for sure! agent_1:Yeah viewing a sporting event would distract you from a bad date. As long as your team is winning! agent_2:Yes, winning is always more fun! I am a huge football fan and love watching college football too. The highest scoring game of all time was 222-0. That had to feel like forever!	agent_1:Yeah surprised they didn't call mercy. you think Cumberland had a pink locker room that game?
122931	agent_1:I've never listened to that album, but enough people did that it went platinum without airplay or a tour to boost its listeners. It's the first to do that agent_2:Impressive!  I wonder if it comes in vinyl?  I miss my old 33rpm record player... agent_1:It might since that seems to be making a comeback. I'm glad we've moved on from audio cassettes though	agent_2:Mine are all stretched out. Eating Whoppers makes me giddy. I earned a free one through a Burger King promotion by unfriending 10 people on Facebook.  Harder than you might think. Especially for me, since I had to first find 10 friendsâ¦
126176	agent_2:Actually, I think it was a VHS copy, that was a long time ago! agent_1:It was VHS. Do you watch a lot of TV as well? agent_2:Not too much. I like comedies though. What about you?	agent_1:I love comedies. Do you like South Park then?
23263	agent_1:I wouldn't want to be a judge.  lol  In 1953 Sir Winston Churchill won a nobel prize for literature.  Never knew that. agent_2:Me either, I would have thought it would have been for peace. agent_1:Yes.  Me too.  I would like to see the annual contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel. lol  That would be funny.	agent_2:Yes, it would!
7868	agent_1:Oh yea...The entire franchise is estimated to be valued at $65 billion! agent_2:That is impressive, I'm surprised that Star Wars is only the fifth highest-grossing media franchise agent_1:Yes!  I agree.  Marcia Lucas, the wife of George Lucas, won an academy award for editing the first movie.	agent_2:Nice, Marcia Lucas had such a huge impact on Star Wars and made the film better
125180	"agent_1:Yea you can youtube radio dramas too or just find this one site that streams thousands of episodes for free agent_2:Yes. Some of those radio shows are interesting. agent_1:Yea, I'd prefer them over listening to the all classical latin program ""Nuntii Latini"", I'd fall right asleep listening to that"	agent_2:I dont think I would care for that show either.
39694	agent_2:I love Dr. House! He's so funny when he's serious.  agent_1:Another actor that I like is Jim Carrey, though now he won't act in movies that don't project positivity. That weeds out most dramas agent_2:Didn't he stop acting though? Didn't he have a documentary?	agent_1:It's possible that he did, and I'm not sure. He could probably still teach it like Jon Hamm does at his old high school. Erin from the Office, portrayed by Ellie Kemper, was one of his students. Jim could pass on his legacy
157147	agent_1:Hi. Do you like football? agent_2:Football is an interesting sport. i dont know much about it. agent_1:I do not either. I do know about the position quarterback. They call the plays and pass the ball.	agent_2:The QB must be an important position. do they get paid the most? how much to they make?
114147	agent_1:Yeah Jeeps are also really cool, they are expensive also I would like a Mustang or a Camaro as well.  agent_2:Do you like to race cars? I definitely drive in the fast lane in the highway a lot of the time, but I'm no race car driver. agent_1:I like to watch car races but Im not a racer, Im a safe driver lol, its been good chatting with you tonight. 	agent_2:It's always good to be safe, but I don't think we need to equip cars with flame-throwers like you can in South Africa lol. Take care, nice chatting with you as well!
88774	agent_2:Unbelievable! I can't see the NBA banning a shot these days - that would be impossible agent_1:yeah me too. do you know who has the highest basketball court on land? agent_2:Maybe the Sear's Tower or another tall American building with a gym on the higher floors?	agent_1:yeah it is the us supreme court
44363	agent_1:Haha I agree with you. Have you ever seen the show Mad Men by the way? The main star of that show who is Jon Hamm used to be a High School Drama teacher agent_2:I did watch Mad Men. Hamm was the perfect guy for that role. he looked like an ad man. agent_1:Yeah he was great in that show. Also one of his former students was Erin from the office which is interesting	agent_2:Oh, yeah! Erin. I like her. she has a girl-next-door quality. i guess Jon did a good job teaching her.
139929	agent_2:I do. He's old now but I did like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  agent_1:True, he might be old but guy has gone down on history for his dunk shots agent_2:Yes he did. He was so good at it that he got it banned from college basketball for over a decade!	agent_1:THat is insane. Do you know who invented the game, basketball?
26385	agent_1:I do, Did you know they can develop white patches in the forehead? agent_2:Yeah but I have not seen them in my pet so not sure about that agent_1:Yeah I guess. In Germany the constitution protects the animals	agent_2:I like that we should adopt laws like that here too
14072	agent_1:In 1924, the first Olympic winter games, Canada scored 132 goals and let in 3 in the entire ice hockey competition. It sounds like the Canadians were angry and punishing everyone else. Why so vindictive? Were they angry about the Canadian winter? agent_2:Not angry, winter with it;s cold and snow is just apart of our lives for a third of the year. It must have been like playing with children for those Olympic players. Things have changed and more countries have grown to love and respect the sport. agent_1:The sport deserves respect. There are some amazing players. For example, a hockey player was traded for $1 in 1993. He later won four Stanley Cups. How did he win the Stanley Cup by himself? Astounding. He must have been Canadian.	agent_2:Apparently an average player works so hard that they loose 8 pounds just playing one game.
87491	agent_1:I guess that makes sense. you have this instrument against your mouth. probably good to have hair. what about women though? LOL agent_2:I am not sure. Have you heard about Pakistan jazz? agent_1:I have not. they have jazz in Pakistan? color me shocked!	agent_2:Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts!
28718	agent_2:Probably not -- I certainly can't afford it LOL. But I like the idea of space tech becoming so cheap that permanent human settlements can exist there. I loved Robinson's Red Mars trilogy. Would you? agent_1:oh ya I would definitely go, I would have to check the sound difference though, i guess things are higher pitched on mars agent_2:As thin as the atmosphere is, everything probably sounds really faint and far away.	agent_1:ya, well if we can figure out how to travel at 1g, we could get to mars in about 3 days, not bad!
137697	agent_1:For sure, it would have been really strange to watch that game. agent_2:You would have blisters on your hands from too much clapping. Do you watch football on TV ?   agent_1:Not usually. I use to have a boyfriend that loved the Patriots. He was from New Hampshire. I never understood how one team could represent 6 states and other teams could represent 1/3 of a state.	agent_2:That's football, imagine how football on TV was before the invention of the yellow line for the first down. It must have been confusing.
57134	agent_1:I would compare it to the Twilight Zone but more focused on modern technology. Some of the stories are so imaginative agent_2:I have seen reviews that compare it too the twilight zone. agent_1:It's hard not to, I believe any sci-fi/anthology series would automatically be compared to one of the best all time.	agent_2:I watched an original netflix western series that was pretty good. Godless.  Had Jeff Daniels in it
76500	agent_2:thats funny. It definitely paid off for him. Did you know there is a movie called ikea heights shot in the ikea store in burbank Ca and the store didn't even know agent_1:Really?  Thats awesome,  No I never heard of that movie.  Their security must really be bad.  agent_2:Probably. did you know that air travel is 10 percent slower now that it was in the 60's to save on fuel	agent_1:That is unfortunate.  Did you know The dutch are creating a commuter bus designed to travel at 160mph.
113448	agent_1:Cool, his dominant use of the dunk, got it banned from college basketball for over a decade. agent_2:Yeah that is pretty funny looking back at it now, I wonder what those people who banned it would think of the game today? agent_1:They'd be shocked for sure.  Did you the know the Supreme court has a basketball court on the top floor and it's known as the highest court in the land?	agent_2:I think I have read that before, what I want to know is what kind of bets are placed on those games!
26991	agent_1:Ha ha I'm not sure! I wonder if Katy Perry likes to read?  I think it's important because it helps with language acquisition, communication, and the sharing of ideas. agent_2:reading is great. i bet russell reads a lot. katy, maybe not so much. she has to style and stuff. do you like to read? agent_1:Yeah I agree. Yes I like to read but not quite as fast as the world record for speeding which is 4700 words per minute!	agent_2:that is astounding, but can anyone remember all of that? the faster i read, the less i remember.
96845	agent_2:Yeah Canada has two national sports one is the previously mentioned hockey and the other is lacrosse agent_1:Did you know a professional hockey player will lose up to 8 pounds in one game? agent_2:That sounds like a physical demanding sport, 8 pounds in a game! I have to start playing hockey lol	agent_1:yeah, I would be lousy. I heard about a guy who got traded for $1 and then went and won four Stanely cups. I would probably be a waste of a dollar. LOL
70078	agent_2:Who knows, he made some famous moves though! Babies actually dance instinctively! agent_1:My newborn has already been dancing, even before walking or crawling. agent_2:do they smile when they hear it as well?	agent_1:Mine does. I am hoping she turns out to be a professional dancer of some sort
138946	"agent_1:I didn't know that.  Out of the 11 minutes of actual gameplay I bet kickers get the least.  agent_2:It wouldn't have occurred to me that chanting ""basketball"" at a guy was racist agent_1:Me either. I'm not sure I see how it is. "	agent_2:I suppose they're saying black people should play basketball not hockey, but really?  Sad
85433	agent_2:Did you know that country musc legend George Strait and Jeff Bezos, who is arguably the wealthiest man in the world, are cousins? agent_1:No I did not know that. Interesting. I just learned that the fender stratocaster guitar was designed for country music. agent_2:That's cool. I didn't know that country music was derived from Irish, Celtic, English, and cowboy music. That makes sense though.	agent_1:It is beautiful to see how music transforms. It also has roots in folk music and blues.
130205	agent_1:and the congressmen get their own three subway lines to move beweeen the capitol and the house and senate offices agent_2:I assume that's for protection? That would make sense. agent_1:Probably so that they are not threatened in public spaces. do you know the only non human to testify before congress?	agent_2:Oh yes, I heard that it was Elmo! I don't know the circumstances though.
151631	agent_2:Yeah, they do a lot of standing around and waiting. i would not want to buy a ticket for 11 minutes of action. agent_1:I would think the action is still good. Although I think I would be more on board for the salary of an engineer. agent_2:Yeah, people like the modern gladiators. it is a brutal game. I would rather do the engineering thing because there are fewer injuries too.	agent_1:Yes and over a lifetime an engineer earns more than the typical NFL player.
32817	agent_1:Yea, I'd love to ride the 160mph commuter bus the Dutch are developing agent_2:That would be fun to ride! agent_1:Yea, I'd love to visit Japan but they have too many tolls, it would cost $300 to travel across the country	agent_2:That's so expensive just to cross the country!
42946	agent_1:Sounds fishy. The black swallower doesn't even need a neck to eat something twice its length. agent_2:Yes and the black swallower can also add something twice it's weight . That sounds pretty crazy. agent_1:Man. Get those things some Blue Apron meals. They sound out of control.	agent_2:And the zebrafish has 84% of the genes known to be associated with human disease. I don't eat fish so I'm not too worried.
100810	agent_2:It really can.  Unless you own it, that is. It's valued at $104 billion.  I imagine Mark Zuckerberg has no problems at all. agent_1:He seems to stay busy. Probably FB could acquire a bunch of companies.  He could help Iceland rewrite their constitution. agent_2:I like how other companies use facebook.  Take burger king for example. They used it for publicity by having people unfriend people to get a free whopper.	agent_1:I wonder what BK hoped to achieve by that. It seems odd to promote unfriending for food.
64192	agent_2:It is amazing what inspires people to start companies.  I didn't realize that Netflix actually sold DVDs at one time but abandoned it to focus on rentals. agent_1:I love some of their original content too.  they spend tons of money on that and it is paying off.  they started producing content in 2012. agent_2:I honestly didn't know that they had been producing their own content for that long.  I heard that the first series they produced was called Lilyhammer.  I had never heard of it.	agent_1:i had never heard of it either.  but i love watching Ozark.
240	agent_2:Now that I had no idea of.  Did you know that some tarantulas keep frogs as pets? agent_1:Wow, that's odd. Two of the most popular pets are dogs and cats agent_2:I have dogs and used to have cats too but dogs are my favorite.  	agent_1:Dogs are my favorite also.  I hope to get another one in the future.
26885	agent_2:Holy smokes that is insane!  I don't know how you could even understand half that many that quickly.  agent_1:Her eyes must move like crazy. Probably can't smoke around her because it will void her warranty. I like that the military has put Ender's Game on their suggested reading lists. That includes the Marine Corps, even though they read 4,700 words/year. agent_2:Yeah her warranty would be toast.  That is an interesting choice to put in there. 	agent_1:Starship Troopers is also on the reading lists. Heinlein loved his military yarns, but then again, he was in the Navy.
162731	agent_1:I heard that before, I wonder if it is to make a good impression for the guests from other countries agent_2:You could be right on that one. The first president of Zimbabwe was called president banana LOL! agent_1:I don't know how I feel about that lol. It was so nice chatting with you!	agent_2:Haha that is surprisingly fitting. Luckily the runner up doesn't become the vice these day otherwise it would be Trump-Clinton! Great talking with you too bye!
147973	agent_1:What do you enjoy for entertainment? agent_2:I do love a good movie, just actually saw Spider-Man Into the Verse, this Christmas with my brother. agent_1:It is a good spiderman film. Do you like spiderman?	agent_2:Oh definitely,I love Peter Parker. It was better than expected. You should see it if you like Spider-Man.
55635	agent_2:Travel is a good thing.  I like places that are different.  I want to go to Japan and drive on the highway. agent_1:I heard that traveling in Japan is quite expensive especially if you go on the highways, the tolls costs more than $300 to travel across the country, I wonder how much the US costs? agent_2:If some one searched for tool roads in the US, they could probably find a few hundred bucks.  Some toll roads are loops though.  Mackinac Island has no motorized vehicles. It is a Michigan tourist trap.	agent_1:Yeah and with how big the US is, I imagine driving on the toll roads could become a lot more expensive than Japan. So how do the people who live on Mackinac Island travel?
156947	agent_1:That's insane humans have been around for such a short time and our accomplishments in that time were over 750 episodes of pokemon lol agent_2:Isn't it amazing? Some Pokemon are kind of like Aliens. In 2010 the UN appointed an ambassador to extraterrestrials in case they make contact. agent_1:That is strange the UN would do that, maybe they could give visiting Aliens one of the 3 pop albums released by the president of Indonesia	agent_2:I would hope they would enjoy it, otherwise it might end up like a horror movie. If I watched that film I could burn up to 180 calories.
12534	agent_2:And since 1998 they've owned IMDB.com. They really have their hands in a lot of buckets, don't they? agent_1:Yep. And unfortunately they're setting the pace for how labor is treated. The conditions in their warehouses will probably be copied in a lot of other service industries if somebody doesn't do something. agent_2:Yeah. I've heard Amazon workers walk between 7 and 15 miles each day as part of their daily shift! 	agent_1:That's horrendous. I did a lot of walking as a hospital orderly, but it wasn't that much. They even wear diapers or pee in bottles because they can't get bathroom breaks.
62613	agent_2:That's a good possibility. There is a lot to mine in that franchise. 20th century Fox, convinced that star wars was going to flop, agreed to George Lucas's proposition to forgo an additional $500k directing fee in return to keep licensing and merchandising rights for himself. George saw the potential in toys. agent_1:That's brilliant! I do not underestimate those type of minds. I am always jealous of that forethought. agent_2:He knew that he was creative. he had successful films before Star Wars. 	agent_1:James earl jones only spent 2.5 hours recording his part in star wars?
74689	agent_1:Good morning! Do you like to read? agent_2:I do like to read. Do you? agent_1:I do. Just about anything too! Did you know Edgar Allen poe wrote a story about a cyborg? I thought that was weird!	agent_2:Wow, that's weird. I do not associate him with cyborgs.  And I definitely do not associate Julius Ceasar with Hercules but he did...
135863	agent_2:yet he invented the sport. go figure agent_1:If you're that bad AND you invented the game, just change the rules so you get better results. agent_2:yeah. do you know kareem abdul-jabbar?	agent_1:I do. He's a basketball player, right?
110467	agent_1:Haha, right? Maybe someone played the sound frequency that causes fear in humans and they were compelled to do it. agent_2:Haha. Did you know that when South Park aired its Family Guy episode The Simpsons Crew sent them flowers? agent_1:Hmm, that's nice.Wonder why though.	agent_2:Probably as a sign of admiration, I would guess.
84705	agent_1:yeah, I've played for years too. It's a fun game. Did you know they suspended Mattingly because he refused to get a haircut?  agent_2:Oh nice. I didnt know that he was the player, wow. What a wild story. I dont know how that would go over now days. agent_1:Yeah, it didn't go over so well then either. To be honest I remember that and thought it was weird. 	agent_2:yeah, lol. I heard that the baseball managers wear the uniform because they are able to play the game at any point, right?
63826	agent_2:I mean she did say that she went online and scouted the club, but there is no evidence of her doing this. TheyÊ»re saying that the idea was planted but how do you just admit something like that if it isnÊ»t true? agent_1:I thought she said initially that she thought it was Disney world?  I hear all the time that people admit to things they didn't do because of the pressures and she was according to her lawyer being manipulated by her husband. agent_2:Yeah, ItÊ»s strange that there was receipts from Turkey and Afghanistan and that she said he was in a terrorist organization. I wonder if their financial situation had anything to do for motive as well. Yeah I think him being at disney world was an excuse. Which is a fricken weird excuse. 	agent_1:Yes that is quite odd, not the first excuse that i would've thought of.  I see that she said she knew he was planning on an ISIS attack but knowing how dangerous he is i'm not sure that we can really blame her nor not going to the authorities. I'm sure she probably feared for her life.
45434	agent_1:That's quite the returnon investment for him. Not a great deal for Reebok thoughâ¦ He's out of basketball and isn't getting good publicity when he is in the news. agent_2:No it was a bad decision on their part. Apparently scientists have determined that granny style is the most effective method to score points. I would have thought it would be more difficult to aim that way. agent_1:I know Rick berry used to shot like that and now his son shoots like that too. He is in college or just graduated. I would be a little embarrrassed to shoot like that...	agent_2:I would be also. It looks very silly. Apparently that's why NBA players refuse to do it even though it is more effective.
70773	agent_2:a lot actually for my family and you? agent_1:Me too. Do you ever shop on Amazon? agent_2:Yes a lot, did you know Jeff built a clock on a mountain somewhere?	agent_1:Yes and it is supposed to run for a whole 10 000 years, amazing
20475	agent_1:I would use that technique if I earned as much money as they do, wouldnt mind looking stupid agent_2:You're right about that! After all, they are the best paid athletes in the world by average annual salary  so they shouldn't worry about looking silly or stupid. agent_1:I know right, so do you like Drake? that Canadian musician?	agent_2:I do, actually! I just can't believe he graduated high school at the age of 25 back in 2012. What about you?
24019	agent_1:that seems so long ago now. do you know how they calculate traffic? agent_2:There is an algorithm that has changed many times over the years. Sometimes focusing on original content but now I believe it's focus is on personal history and preferences.  agent_1:yeah they just track android decies on the road	"agent_2:It is an interesting company. They have a strange almost frat house tradition for new employees.  They are called ""nooglers"""
136129	agent_1:I know! Its a really long time ago, although it has only become popular in the last decade. agent_2:They have changed everything.    They even created their own font! agent_1:I agree, Amazon is a game changer for sure, Jeff Bezos also built a clock into a mountain, its supposed to run for about 10000 years	agent_2:Interesting.     I wonder if the price matching at Best Buy and Target have hurt their business any.
71808	agent_1:I know right and travelling by air all the time must be really expensive as well agent_2:Hopefully bus service is good.  agent_1:It must be or maybe gas is cheaper out there, I wonder how much flights are worth	agent_2:They'd be pretty short flights, so hopefully not too expensive.
80180	agent_1:Again, I agree with you. I liked The Mask too. I have seen Hugh Laurie be really funny too, outside of the House role.  He is also a great musician. agent_2:I didn't know he played an instrument, what does he play? agent_1:He is a great pianist and he has a couple of CD's out. Jazzy, soulful...he sings as well.	agent_2:Hmm, I'll have to check it out, I like Jazz music, old Kenny G fan.  It's funny, Bill Murray, thinks Kung Fu, Hustle is the best comedy ever,  I disagree, but I did like Caddyshack and Stripes.
164723	"agent_2:I'm more of a Patriots fan than a fan of Donald Trump.  agent_1:Trump holds Kraft, Belichick and Brady in high regard; he has called them winners in the past agent_2:Yes, Trump like's to associate himself with anything in the popular culture that is a winner. But the Pats seem ""self made"" unlike the Donald. "	agent_1:The Patriots also know how to conduct themselves as winners and come back from behind.
129549	agent_1:do you lkike football? agent_2:I love it. U of Iowa painted the visitor locker room pink agent_1:I wonder if that is supposed to have some effect on them	agent_2:I wonder too. Did you know bowlers used to make more than football players in the 60s
18991	"agent_1:Oh, I think I've seen that. That film was an adaptation of a book? Good thing we live in the current century because in the 18th century, there was even a ""moral panic"" because reading was so widespread! I think we have gone backwards a bit and a lot of people don't read books these days haha. agent_2:Ya I agree.  Reading is great. Apparently the longest piece of fiction is 4 million words long, and it is about a video game called Super Smash Bros. agent_1:Huh, I wonder if that's still considered reading. Maybe if more people read, they would know how to get out of the predicament like when a judge sued a small dry cleaning business for $67 million for losing a pair of pants, I do not know any pants worth that amount of money."	agent_2:Speaking of pants.  It was illegal for women to wear pants in Paris, France until 2013.  Can you believe that?
47479	agent_2:Yes, I agree. Do you watch sports for entertainment too? agent_1:Is MMA considered a sport? Oooh is martial arts considered entertainment? Yeah. I think boxing counts too. I really like Mixed Martial Arts. And I've had a few friends that played soccer, but that's about it. Oh my dad loved football when I was growing up and I'd watch although I had no idea what was going on. Haha! agent_2:Haha, I have trouble following along in football. Anyway, what do you think about a type of soccer where three teams face each other at the same time? Seems confusing!	agent_1:Definitely confusing. Might be fun to watch all that confusion! Haha. It's interesting that we call it soccer, since everywhere else it's called football or association football. I guess we do so, because soccer was slang for football way back when.
140382	agent_2:He is a German soccer player he won the 2014 World Cup with his team and donated his bonus so that 23 children could have surgeries in Brazil agent_1:That is so wonderful. It's good to hear a sweet story like that. agent_2:He has a great heart, so do you also like American football?	agent_1:Not really.  Do you mean soccer or football?  HAHA
131503	agent_1:I like to travel but I suffer from the same problem, I am broke lol, the king of Hawaii sure had a lot of money, he traveled around the world, expensive adventure agent_2:I think he was a smart man. See the world and understand people better. I wish I could do that. agent_1:Yeah I am envious of him, another great place is Mackinac Island	agent_2:I wonder what the pace of life is there. No cars. NO phones? That would be good. Peace and quiet and no distracted drivers.
70038	agent_1:I dont think so, I liked his role in Aquaman so maybe, he is scary looking, I agree.  agent_2:I didnt see aquaman. i guess he looks the part though. he probably was popular in that role. agent_1:Yeah and it was a really good movie in fact. So back to Game of Thrones, sad how the series are coming to an end	agent_2:I guess it had to eventually. the author has been slow to produce new material. he is sitting on a gold mine.
142499	agent_2:nope never seen it I just know she was famous, have you seen the Movie Aladdin? agent_1:I have. Have you? agent_2:I have yes, Robin williams did a great job and started the trend of celebrity voice actors in disney movies!	agent_1:He is really talented. I had no idea until I saw his biopic on HBO. So good.
22842	"agent_2:Pretty much. Just reading through the article here though, the Burger King promotion, wow, I wonder how much rift that may have caused between people agent_1:I don't think many people actually did it ;) I mean can You ""friend"" back people from Your ""Unfriended"" list ? agent_2:I would think so, I do not think there is a ban on that. Just wondering why they would launch that king of promotion, it is not very positive"	agent_1:I guess... I've never actually tried that ;)
114151	agent_1:I do, ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?  agent_2:Gladiator, What we do in life will echo through eternity, lol! Speaking of Romans/Greeks Caesar visited Britain in 50bc and found that they use chicken for entertainment.  agent_1:Hilarious! By the way did you play nintendo? 	agent_2:Yes i loved the Nintendo and it's 54 colors display. We have come a long way!
161825	agent_1:Good luck with that!  Maybe that is where the government is planning to destroy Wikileaks, which we all know will end up on that site anyway. agent_2:Or maybe the Gov't is using AM radios to harvest the energy from Jupiter's radio storms agent_1:I might take that over forcing us to listen to US music.  In Canada, a law mandates that nearly half of all music content  on the radio has to be Canadian.	agent_2:Still it's not as worse as listening to the all classical latin new program Nuntii Latini in Finland
127652	agent_2:Me too! I got sirius XM with a car and found Kenny Chesney radio. I have been listening to them a lot.  agent_1:I like how country music is the amalgamation of the working class americans.  agent_2:My son is 7 and he is the one who really loves it. I am not sure hillbilly music is a positive connotation.	agent_1:Well it is better than urban decadence music aka jazz. Personally I like jazz, but henry ford helped spread country music to mitigate the spread of jazz
64826	agent_2:That goes back quite a ways! Usenet. Hm. First published to the internet in 1990 and is older than the first web browsers. agent_1:Was it totally text base at first?  IMDB has so many widgets and graphics that it's overwhelming now.  agent_2:Yeah, I guess that the visitors really know what to look for. Usually I just want a rating for a movie. I use Rottentomates too.	agent_1:That's why I use it too.  I guess Harrison Ford and De Niro have the top spots in IMDB's Top 205 with 8 appearances.  De Niro has been very vocal as of late.
161198	agent_1:Football is a tough sport and hard on the body. Baker mayfield probably should have pursued his love of competitive gaming instead of football. agent_2:Yeah but I bet he wouldnt be making as much, or maybe he could have become an engineer, their lifetime earnings are bigger than the ones of a football player agent_1:Or he could have played kickball, which Canadians call soccer-baseball.	agent_2:Thats a weird name for it, so are you a fan of baseball?
148511	agent_1:I guess defense is also cool, a real strategist can win the game, do you know who Alex Smith is? agent_2:I have heard of him. he is a QB? agent_1:He is a QB and also a really smart man. He got his BA degree in just 2 years and then started working on his masters degree	agent_2:Wow. that is fast. he must have a great tactical mind. perfect for QB. Anyway, great chat!
147693	agent_1:Nice good for him. The president of Zimbabwe was called Banana agent_2:Yeah that is pretty crazy.. In Guatemala close relatives of former presidents can not legally run for president agent_1:I like that rule kind of to be honest. Did you know Roosevelt did not allow Christmas trees in?	agent_2:I did not know that Jimmy carter turned all white house thermostats down to 65 degrees during the winter
66369	agent_1:Hi, how are you this morning? agent_2:Hello there, I am good thank you, how about you? agent_1:I'm well, thanks for asking.  Do you like baseball?	agent_2:I do enjoy baseball, I watched a ton this year due to a major injury and my team did really well!  How about you?
70285	agent_1:It is. I am super shocked by that one. I realize that Bart is essential to the show but it's been on so long that I would have assumed there was more than one that did not feature him.  agent_2:yeah for sure.I als9o did not know that stuff about the pets like it is not legal to own a pet you can only be there gurdian WHAT?lol agent_1:That's surprising to me since they are normally treated as property in a court of law which I am not a fan of. I think of them as family. 	agent_2:I absolutley agree but that is just weird to have it put as there gurdian
30068	agent_2:Yes, he signed with Under Armour. agent_1:Good. It is said that he is the greatest shooter in NBA history. agent_2:I wonder if someone shouted out his real name Wardell if that would bother his shooting?	agent_1:Maybe, I dont think anyone other than family probably ever calls him that.
61018	agent_2:Oh my, I don't know. There were only two presidents that did not use the bible at their swearing in ceremonies. agent_1:Isn't that crazy? I also can't believe it was common for students to be required to read the Bible in school for their elementary education up until 1963! agent_2:Yes, I knew that. I would have liked to see the biblical tower of babal but not going to Iraq to see something like it!	agent_1:Agreed. It would be nice to see but you're right. It's not worth it. Did you also know the word apple is known as Apple because the Bible was translated into Latin and the word apple means both evil and apple? I'll have to remember that next time I eat one. Ha!
126857	agent_1:Very true. IT securtiy in Washington are not allowing people to access government servers from their wifi either. Making it tough on a lot of people. agent_2:The govt needs to control access to its systems, but the workers should have a way to get in to get work done. Govt jobs have less appeal because of this. agent_1:I agree. Did you know that wiki leaks published the plans the gov had to destroy wikileaks?	agent_2:That's ironic! I bet Wikileaks has all kinds of interesting gov't plans.
13546	agent_1:I didn't know that. I guess due to his books I always assumed he was this squeaky clean parental sort but he actually was drinking during prohibition and got caught. agent_2:I blame him for getting caught, not the drinking part. I mean what else would you have done back then? agent_1:Well he was a determined young man because he took up the pen name Seuss so he could keep on writing after that.	agent_2:Good for him! I would have given up. I wrote for a few years and it was a lonely experience...
86993	agent_2:Noway!! That's incredible. Like all languages it is complex interaction between text and reader. Ya know, a funny fact is hat the world record for speed reading is 4,700 words per minute. agent_1:I wonder how much that person retains. They can't possibly keep it all in their head. agent_2:I bet it isn't much! How could it possibly be. I think it's a fun game to play with guest, when you read terrible poetry aloud without laughing.	agent_1:They probably found some of the worst poetry out there. And learned to read it for maximum humorous effect.
109767	agent_2:Yeah, it's kind of a weird place to try and travel. Most of the people don't have cars and there is no public rail service, so they mostly travel domestic flights to travel between the cities.  It's crazy. agent_1:They must spend a fortune travelling kind of like in Japan, tolls can be really expensive there agent_2:More than $300 to travel across Japan.  All the roads are toll roads.  Now, I've been there a few times, so I know how much it costs!	agent_1:You have been ther before? it must be amazing I envy yoy, I hope one day I can visit the country
66749	"agent_2:That's kind of bait and switch-ish. I wonder why? Tom cost too much? agent_1:Probably or his brother could use the cash?  Wow, it's illegal for kids in S. Korea that are 16 and under to play video games after midnight. agent_2:They do like their ""cathode ray tube amusement devices""."	agent_1:Otherwise know as video games.  Wow, that's a mouthful -- typical military.  Probably called them CRTAD...
87502	agent_1:Yes, I agree the internet does have its good purposes.  Did you know that the 3 horizontal line menu on apps and websites is called a hamburger button? agent_2:Yes, The people buy the products through online make the internet more valuable. Which reduces the time spent on shop and make more comfortable. agent_1:Do you shop online alot?	agent_2:Yes. You like online shopping ?
163372	agent_1:Hi, do you like the NFL? agent_2:I love it. Watch it every week during the season. Im a Steelers fan. agent_1:Me too. Boooo! I'm a Bengals fan lol. 	agent_2:Im truly sorry to hear that. Lol.
64893	agent_1:Yeah and they understand pointing too, like elephants	agent_2:Yeah and they also can reason better than chimps
86243	agent_1:haha of course. We've come a long way from using our tools and skills to be great persistence hunters. We are naturally good at running long distances agent_2:It is a good thing to go for a run.  Humans are the only mammals that can not breathe and swallow at the same time.  I wonder who discovered this important fact. agent_1:Id guess the guy who invented the Hymlec Maneuver! 	agent_2:Dr. Hymlec.  That guy got famous thats for sure. I wonder why humans want to wear clothes while running.  I would run much faster without clothes.
95983	agent_1:I don't understand why some guys propose and their girlfriend says no. I mean, don't you have to know going into it what thier answer is going to be? agent_2:One would think.  Weiss later pretty much alluded to the fact that it was a planned thing.  C'mon, in front of all those people and cameras?  She had to know. agent_1:Agreed. And t have a 67 year old ring, that's pretty romantic.	agent_2:That was a nice touch.  I think some of the controversy is planned too.  Like when Spike Lee lost his cool at the last Oscars.
49417	agent_1:The present day events of the Incredibles are set in the 1960s. Thatâs a great period for clothing and architecture.  agent_2:Yeah, also the director liked to use actors and actresses that were likely to quit or get fired, I wonder why he did that. agent_1:I don't know either. Why would actors quit? Seems strange.	agent_2:Maybe he wanted people who didn't care about the job so they would be more willing to do what he ask regardless of consequences.
141083	agent_1:Heck yeah! I would like to go without my phone! And poor Stephen King was afraid of Bambi when he was a kid. agent_2:I know! The king of horror writing. Do you think that helped him become a better writer or pointed him in the right direction? I bet he burned some calories! agent_1:Like 180 of them. Who knows what's in that man's mind! Do you view abstract art before watching one of his movies?	agent_2:No, should I? I do appreciate art a lot!
1339	agent_2:Yes, she did major changes.. and is interesting George did not get the award for directing! agent_1:Eminem has more oscars than George Lucas!  That is hard to believe! agent_2:Wow, and he has won more awards than Leo Di Caprio, Johnny Depp and Bill murray combined	agent_1:I didnt realized he had any at all, I wonder what they were all for.
25458	agent_1:I knew she was good, how much better? agent_2:SO good that she once broke 8 national records by scoring 105 points in a game agent_1:wow that is crazy! I knew he was good, but she was amazing! That is better than Wilt Chamberlain! Do you have a favorite team?	agent_2:I do not actually, just enjoy the games. Did you hear of that deal Iverson signed with Rebook in 2001?
124655	agent_1:I think Trump is the wealthiest President of all time by far.  agent_2:Probably. He doesn't have musical talents like the Indonesian president though. His pop music is pretty good! agent_1:Have you heard it?  That is pretty impressive!  3 albums while in office,  I bet he was the fun president lol had concerts all the time and after parties lol 	agent_2:Some countries have prime ministers. The Australian PM exists only because of custom.
107644	agent_1:Yes, quite a family. Have you heard of the Stonemans?  agent_2:yeah, didn't they make that song The Sinking of the Titanic? really popular country song. agent_1:I think so.  I didn't realize Don Owens died in 1963 after falling asleep while driving. 	agent_2:yeah it's sad that most of those things that he made weren't recorded
52575	agent_2:No The Ramones definitely did a ton of concerts, I think 2,200 in 20 years, that's insane! agent_1:Seems exhausting but surely they made a lot of money doing that! agent_2:Yes I agree! Did you hear about Creed though? Apparently they were sued because their concerts were so bad LOL I won't be seeing a Creed concert myself after hearing that	agent_1:Haha, I used to like their music. That's quite surprising. So Linkin Park's concerts were much better I presume. Their album is the best selling of the 21st century.
44192	agent_2:No, I have no reason to visit there. That's pretty crazy, so like they fly everywhere?  agent_1:Yes between the major cities. Apparently the roads are really bad so they can't always drive either. Have you ever been to Mackinac Island by the way? agent_2:No, I've never even heard of that. What continent is it on? 	agent_1:Yes it's in the state of Michigan actually. I live in Michigan and I've been there LOL. I don't think it's that cool, the only thing is they don't allow cars on the island, all they use are horses and horse buggies
131585	agent_2:I could understand adding it to the Urban dictionary but not Merriam Webster agent_1:I 100% agree with that. It seems the more apt place for it.  agent_2:Do you do many word searches on Google at all?	agent_1:Maybe rarely. I can't think of the last instance where I did.
40981	agent_2:Actually a lot of their clothing had the word APPLE on it in very large letters. agent_1:Interesting that the pilgrims really had colorful outfits mostly but only wore black for special occasions, who would have known? agent_2:Did you know there is a store in Alabama that only sells items from the unclaimed baggage at airports?	agent_1:I've heard of that but not that store specifically.  I guess there are a lot of interesting clothing and items there.  I wonder who gets ownership of unclaimed luggage and the profits.
69253	agent_1:It is about robots created for a western-themed amusement park. It is quite complex.  agent_2:Hmm, sounds like it could be interesting.  Who's all in it? agent_1:There is Evan Rachel Wood and Thandie Newton. And James Mardsen	agent_2:Cool.  So are the robots good, bad or some of both?
73028	agent_1:Hello agent_2:Hi, are you a fan of Netflix? agent_1:I love Netflix.  I am one of the 137 million total subscribers LOL	agent_2:Yea, me too.  I can't believe they have only been producing original content for only 7 years.
67448	agent_1:Hello, do you use facebook a lot? I do! agent_2:Hey there, yes I use Facebook almost every day. Did you know that Facebook allows anyone who claims to be 13 years or older to join agent_1:only 13? I thought that the minimum age should be at least 18. Did you know that Facebook also has 48 different custom gender options!	agent_2:No I didn't know that, that's a lot of options. I think it's actually 58 though, it's sad that 30% of American adults use Facebook as their source of news though
79428	agent_1:Well depends how you define sport I guess. Anyway, yes I do. Why? agent_2:He won a Nobel price for literature back in 1953, agent_1:You would think he would win a nobel price for something else	agent_2:Yeah for something like peace, I guess he is a talented writter
151651	agent_2:I wish that I had a crystal ball what would tell me the outcomes so that my wife would not always get angry for losing money. agent_1:Yeah wouldn't we all lol.  Did you know there is no rule about female players in the league? agent_2:That's fair. I wonder if there are any women who dream of playing for the NFL.	agent_1:I think there are lots out there trying but with no high school or college football for women i'm sure it's hard.
2580	"agent_1:Yeah, that's what I've heard. The first cloned pet was a cat, did you know that?  agent_2:I didn't know that, would you call that a ""copy cat?"" haha agent_1:Hilarious, well there are more tigers living as pets in the US than living in the wild in Asia. "	agent_2:That's crazy, I heard that Theodore Roosevelt had over 20 pets, including a bear and a hyena.
24145	agent_1:Sounds about right. Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth too .Bandwidth is cheap! agent_2:That's true! Why are they mailing so many things? I wonder if it's more secure than sending files through email! agent_1:They still send DVDs, and I'm sure promotions to people without current accounts.	agent_2:That's true. I forgot they still use DVDs. I don't even have a player anymore. Hey, do you like Marvel or superhero movies at all? I think Black Panther is on Netflix now.
141013	agent_2:That makes sense, it was a big city even back then. I have heard Unicef donates water to children for not using your phone agent_1:Wow, that's really generous. I wonder what the criteria for the donation is... agent_2:I am not sure, I need to look into it, I barely use my phone!	agent_1:You could help thirsty kids! The cables carrying phone and internet data across oceans are only 2.7 inches in diameter and just lay on the ocean floor.
8059	agent_2:Wow I did not know it has been that long. I really think Bernie should run as an independent and not as democrat. The fear is always splitting the vote, but that happens anyway. agent_1:Yep that's true. Every president with a beard has always been a republican. agent_2:Really? I guess you're right. Of course the gop used to be completely different than the mess they are today. Only recently I discovered GOP stands for grand old party...	agent_1:Oh wow I didn't know it stood for that either. The last time a republican was elected president without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was back in 1928.
161092	agent_2:As a matter of fact I am, and play fantasy and watch at least a couple games per weekend. You? agent_1:I play tons of fantasy. I wish there werent only 16 regular season games so fantasy would last a little longer!  agent_2:Me too. I was kind of aware of the NFL planting tracking kids in shoulder pads since they have the next gen stats on TV often.	agent_1:I had not idea about that! Do they have the sensors or micro chips in anything else?
7544	agent_1:I haven't read much of that, I mainly read travel guides, as I travel a lot. I'm hoping to get to Macinac Island this summer, and bike around the island. agent_2:Understand that it is a lovely, slow-paced place. Try a horse-drawn carriage there! Have you, like Caesar, ever been to Greece, through Italy, to Germany or England - or elsewhere in Europe? agent_1:I have been to Iceland, it's expensive as I had to travel by plane between towns.	agent_2:My son had a stop in Iceland on route to Australia. Wants to go back for a real visit. Understand they have no public rail service there. Too many volcanos and other impassable terrain??
78617	agent_2:Yea, I like the knicks but usually follow all 30 NBA teams a litte agent_1:are the warriors going to win everything this year? who else is good? agent_2:Not too many teams, it's gonna be hard to beat Golden State at the Oracle arena	agent_1:i guess the home court advantage is strong with them. i heard that the bucks are good? do they have a chance?
108582	agent_1:Yes because they parodied their anti-democratic campaign agent_2:Yes but it is ironic because they are the ones that put it in the air agent_1:I know right? Do you know what percentage of tea party identify as democrats?	agent_2:Yes that is 15%. Nice chat tonight
74876	"agent_2:Sounds like a chore but can't be worse than watching the UK version of That 70s show called ""Days like These"" agent_1:Yeah the name of that sounds dumb, I was glad that that show was canceled after only 10 episodes I don't think the humor translated overseas agent_2:Have you ever watched the movie Spartacus? Stanley Kubrick took over cinematography from the actual cinematographer he hired"	agent_1:That is cool and I do like that movie a lot. Who is your favorite cinematographer? I know that I really like Roger deakins
57572	agent_2:Service to literature.  I havent read any of his works, have you? agent_1:No, I haven't. But I did find out some interesting facts about literature, Shakespeare in particular.  Did you know that Shakespeare invented the names: Miranda, Jessica, and Olivia? agent_2:I didnt know that.  I knew about some of the phrases he used being still in use today, like wild-goose chase, and full circle.	agent_1:Yes, and what about 'good riddance', 'in my heart of hearts', and 'break the ice'. Who would have figured that's where those sayings came from?
57146	agent_1:I know! I put it up last year when decorating the christmas tree, lol. Netflix accounts for 33 percent of north americas bandwidth from 9pm to 12am! agent_2:That tells you what a lot of people are doing late at night.  Have you ever heard about a job at Netflix called tagging? agent_1:I haven't, what do they do?	agent_2:They get paid to watch shows on Netflix and tag the content. They are called taggers.
8971	agent_1:That is my understanding, I believe he was forced from professorship in the late sixties, probably because he was black. agent_2:oh ok, how about john macain, he was a jeopardy contestant in 1965  agent_1:He was, I wonder how he did?  With the length of that show, and it's weekly showing there must be lots of now famous people that have been on it.	agent_2:probably, he also made a cameo in the movie wedding crashers
89302	agent_1:I suppose they thought they would give an unfair advantage. Jordan didn't obey them and wore them anyway.  agent_2:Huh, I guess that makes sense since Nike's always ahead of the game. Reminds me of when LeBron turned down the Reebok deal for 10 million dollars, and then Nike offered him 90 million. They're good at attracting the superstars.  agent_1:I'm not a big fan of LeBron. He didn't live up to the Lakers hopes. 	agent_2:Haha, you're not the only one. Apparently even members of al-qaeda spoke out against his move to Miami. He seems to be losing support everywhere.
42020	agent_2:I think people knew from the start he was a great player.  Did you know he has a photographic memory? agent_1:I didn't know that.  Do you like Steph Curry? agent_2:Yes, he plays on one of my favorite teams.	agent_1:Nice!  The Warriors are on a role winning back to back titles.  I think they might have a decent shot at winning again this year.
135862	agent_1:I would take half of that! Naismith doesn't seem to be a good coach... agent_2:yet he invented the sport. go figure agent_1:If you're that bad AND you invented the game, just change the rules so you get better results.	agent_2:yeah. do you know kareem abdul-jabbar?
135570	agent_2:Don't know.  He was once orange though.  I didn't realize Jim Henson created Sesame Street.  I knew he did muppets.  agent_1:Did you ever follow Caroll Spinney? agent_2:Until now, I'd never heard of him.  I guess he created Oscar with a heart so he can't be all bad.	agent_1:Well Caroll spiney was Big Bird and also Oscar the Grouch, he announced his retirement I think thats kind of sad, I grew up watching the show
54619	agent_1:Yes she does , I heard that had something to do with it . It could all be rumors idk . But ... I love a lot of specials . But not hers . To each their own :) .   agent_2:Agreed. I am waiting on Chapelle to do another set of specials. Ellen is going to on there in the next couple of months. agent_1:I love both of them ! That would be awesome . I also love Jeff Dunham , or should i say all his dummies . Just easy , corny laughs lol .  	agent_2:Did you know Ryan Stiles dropped out of high school? Pretty impressive resume to drop out of school.
80809	agent_1:It was actually Edgar Allen Poe.  agent_2:That is really cool.  I didnt know he wrote about things like that. agent_1:I have his complete works and I missed that story as well. Did you also know that Caesar wrote fan fiction?	agent_2:I heard about that!  Happy Ides of March, BTW.
6233	agent_2:I have never seen it. I do like Chris Hemsworth agent_1:Yah he is a good actor, I like Natallie Portman and Tom HIddleston too, both great actors and actresses! agent_2:I agree but Idris Elba and Anthony Hopkins are the best	agent_1:Idris Elba is a great actor, did you see The Wire at all?
75569	agent_2:The iphone sounds pretty complicated too, it's amazing it has more computing power than the Nuclear ICBM deterrent agent_1:Thats actually kind of scary I own an iPhone and I didn't know I was packing so much power in pocket, scary thing agent_2:Speaking of scary the black swallower fish can eat prey twice its size	agent_1:That is scary, that fish means business eating prey twice its size and also ten times its weight, scary animal
59439	agent_2:yes US adopted Cars much faster than the rest of the world  agent_1:I can see that... The US has lots of space to transverse,  It's funny that trunks are called that because back in the day, people literally but trunks there. agent_2:back in days polo shirts are invented for tennis ..  some things have weird history	"agent_1:Yeah, they should be called ""tennis shirts""."
142619	agent_2:Yeah that is a lot, it took them 16 years to put those out there agent_1:True, that is a long time. Do you use your phone much? agent_2:I do a lot actually. Did you ever use a rotary phone though?	agent_1:Nope did not but it sounds like it took forever to make a call with them
129333	agent_1:Based on his work history, yes. Despite the  huge growth in the women`s game in recent years, this highlighted that we do not have enough female coaches at the highest level, unfortunately. agent_2:I am sure they could have found someone who doesn't engage in misogynistic and sexist comments.  agent_1:Yes, agree.	"agent_2:The Football Association,"" Kick It Out CEO is not a fan of his either."
128365	agent_1:Me either! wonder how it came about?   agent_2:Some person was probably sick and tired of people talking out loud lol. I thought Louis Braille did such a great job with the braille system and he was only 15! agent_1:Yes, he was so smart to help the blind people out! Can you speed read?	agent_2:I can, but not too fast, more like a jog read lol. How about you?
62132	agent_1:I am a big animal lover.  I really enjoy going to the zoo and watching wildlife shows.   Do you like animals? agent_2:Yea I love animals, nice to see April the giraffe gave birth to a calf on April 15 agent_1:Yes, it is amazing how fast giraffes grow.  10 feet tall at 1 year is pretty quick	agent_2:It's crazy that April is 15 and the father of the calf was only 5
63994	agent_2:No, I did when i was in the kid.  Did you hear about the guy who saved 3 million dollars worth of cards in his grandfathers attic? agent_1:I did, I used to collect a lot, I wish I would have saved them and see what mine were worth, not three million though agent_2:I would sort my Red Sox cards while listening to their games on the radio	agent_1:that is awesome, i used to love sorting my cards as a kid and trading them
69641	agent_2:I do, what do you think will happen if the internet ever gets hacked of deleted? I guess there would be a lot of riots and problems right away agent_1:I know the Alexandria Library has saved a copy of the internet in case it's ever burned, so there's hope everything could one day be restored, I suppose! agent_2:That is a relief! I wonder how much time it would take to restore the internet from that backup copy at Alexandria, it must be a difficult job to do.	agent_1:I can only imagine considering how massive it is. The internet is so popular, there's apparently 3G cell service as well as internet atop Mt. Everest!
93252	agent_2:HAHA that's awesome! Pink Floyd's guitarist turned a houseboat on the river into a floating recording studio. agent_1:I wonder if smashing a guitar like Matthew Bellamy would sink such a location! agent_2:LOL. Brian May uses coins as a pick.	agent_1:He is also a smart guy with a phd in astrophysics.
120642	agent_1:I think it's funny that they voted on Fred Durst! agent_2:I guess if you're from Austin, TX, you must like Fred Durst. agent_1:Or they hate him and that's why they wanted to name garbage after him LOL. In any case I wonder if the rename actually happened?	agent_2:Not sure.  That is a strange name though.  Almost as strange as the first president f Zimbabwe, President Banana
96083	agent_2:I switch between that and rock music, or my favorite albums like Linkin Park and NWA agent_1:Did you know the Fender Stratocaster was originally intended for country music? agent_2:I never knew that, I would never have thought that. Were you a Pink Floyd fan at all?	agent_1:Not that much. Why do you ask?
141650	agent_1:Haha, so true.  I played when I was kid and my kids played as well. agent_2:I wonder if they count those in the estimates.  agent_1:I bet they do.  Seems like they are always telling us we Americans don't get it when it comes to soccer.  They always state how big the numbers are, but when it comes to sports in the USA football is king.	agent_2:I wonder what the variation where 3 teams plays each other looks like, have you seen it?
15112	agent_1:Yes, I was suprised that it became a cult classic. I found it a badly acted B movie when it first came out but I guess the military types like it because it is very pro military.  agent_2:I thought it was campy, but I never read the book. Did you read it?  agent_1:Campy is the right word. It is not really my type of book. I like to read science fiction novels but more fantasy type stories.	agent_2:It's not a terrible movie. Anyways, nice chatting with you.
33918	agent_1:in 2001 linkin park played 324 known concerts agent_2:I loved Linkin Park. They were one of my favorite bands in high school. agent_1:Speaking of bands in one of the ancient roman amphitheater pink floyd recorded a live concert in 72	agent_2:That's awesome. What sort of concerts do you like?
118908	agent_1:this seems odd. New orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player and if they are already dining at a restaurant and an nfl player comes in after, the cheerleaders are required to leave. agent_2:So sorry I'm not sure about this. agent_1:I know, weird, right? Nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field. they are also located inside footballs to track: velocity, rotation, ball speed and location.	agent_2:You know a lot about this.
102907	agent_2:I am not sure, I would be interested to see, do you know? agent_1:I think it was politcal science,  dont quote me though lol  agent_2:That would make sense lol. Did you know lincoln was the first president photographed at his inauguration	agent_1:I didnt until recently,  thats awesome.  I wonder if he was smiling in the picture lol
148012	agent_2:No I hadn't. It sounds quite crazy though. agent_1:I'm not sure I understand all of the story, but it sounds as if the conflict has international repercussions. Do you play an instrument? agent_2:I do not but I do own a piano.	agent_1:The piano has an interesting history. It was invented by an Italian.
60492	agent_1:Fair points - but the Moon doesn't rotate, meaning there is constant sunlight and darkness on half/half of the satellite.  In addition to being a lot closer, it could be a great tourist destination for the rich and powerful!  agent_2:Haha all fair points. I think the rich are going to start going up into orbit for fun soon anyway. I think Richard Branson and possibly Amazon are working on that. agent_1:I think Branson, Bezos, and Musk will get it done way before the government/NASA do!  Amazon will probably have same day delivery to the Moon for Prime members!!!	agent_2:I wonder if the government is ever going to break up Amazon. They literally have their hands in everything.
40543	agent_2:ha I did not know that. i have seen that movie and it is like a live action cartoon almost. It's amusing that Bill Murray likes it but it is a really good movie. agent_1:Has Bill Murray ever done a bromantic comedy? Harold and Kumar is an example of the genre. agent_2:That's a good question and I've never heard of that term before. Maybe a movie like Stripes is the only one I could think of. But it's interesting that ryan stiles dropped out of school to pursue comedy, that's risky.	agent_1:Some people just can't deal with high school. Probably didn't see himself as college material. I know that Demetri Martin left Harvard Law to pursue comedy.
73536	agent_1:wow. I can't believe that myspace had turned down an offer to buy facebook for $75 million. Talk about a loss agent_2:Yeah,  missed opportunities!  30% of american adults use facebook as their primary source of news agent_1:thats horrible they are getting some false news sometimes im sure. did you know that mark zuckerberg suffers from red green colorblindness and thats why fb is primarily blue	agent_2:I did.  That is very interesting.
51897	agent_2:I have never heard that.  But I do know that even if you are in the space station, you are still allowed to vote! agent_1:that is good to know, I think it's cool that they are developing drop pods to deploy military units from space, tahts like from a videogame! agent_2:That is cool.   It is interesting trying to simulate weightlessness in movies - the apollo 13 cast did 612 takes aboard a zero gravity plane..	agent_1:ya that is cool, thats a great movie btw, one day I hope regular people like you and I can travel into space to experience that!
2949	agent_2:O wow, that must be fantastic! I also like the Boston Red Sox, did you know the new york times has partial ownership? agent_1:I did. Baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if the need arises agent_2:Cool and smart! The Red Sox have won 9 world series games!	agent_1:That's a lot! Up until 2005, a married couple, for 24 years, scheduled all 2430 major league baseball games played each year
66805	agent_1:Yeah a little bit... have had apple computers as long as i can remember! agent_2:Which year did you get your first apple? agent_1:i was working on them in 86 Apple IIe that were running DOS.  Purchased my first one in 91?	agent_2:Was that the one that had a single button on the mouse I remember having that one as a kid in my parents' office
147283	agent_2:Hello there, I am well thank you.  How are you today?  Are you an NFL fan? agent_1:I usually follow around the playoffs. How about you? agent_2:I am a fan of my local team, I do watch most of the playoff games when I can though.  	agent_1:It's interesting that the NFL has no restrictions on female players. I wonder if there will ever be a change.
158051	agent_2:haha no I did not no that-what a crazy site that would be to see! Another weird fact is that it is illegal to warm up your car in Ohio-what an odd law! agent_1:Really? I've never heard of this. Why?  agent_2:No idea maybe because when people warm up their cars and then go back inside the cars commonly get stolen. It is interesting how things vary by country. For example in India, the horns have to be very durable because they are used so often. I barely ever use my horn!	agent_1:Yeah, that is pretty crazy. Do you listen to AM radio?
21616	agent_2:That is amazing! I love how Dalmatians who are known to be with firefighters because they kepp the horsed calm and would protect them, awesome! agent_1:I find it crazy Clint Eastwood ended up developing an allergy to horses in mid-life agent_2:Really? I have never heard of people being allergic to horses, must be rare. I would love to be ride horses instead of driving, like the kids who rode their horses to ...no vehicle day....but they got suspended.	agent_1:Horses aren't vehicles so I have no idea why those students would get suspended
63615	"agent_2:I do one occasionally.  My wife is really good.  Most large puzzles are 15 by 15  agent_1:Exactly! I guess there's someone offering a set of  16 puzzles called Suite Sixteen. Great idea! agent_2:That would allow for different clues than normal.  One can learn trivia from those clues.  Like two words that have the word ""taxi"" in them."	agent_1:Right? I think it would be fun, I love crossword puzzles.
118192	agent_1:There are a lot of actors who certainly made their careers based on that model of a movie agent_2:Yes it took years for the cop to get over this case. agent_1:I bet, it would be something that would haunt me for sure.  I heard at the end of his life he was finally able to let go a little.	agent_2:Yes the zodiac killer killed a bunch of people in cars - did you know that cars did not become widely available until early in the 20th century?
156135	agent_1:That is very cool. Tyreek Hill is another talented player. Have you heard of him? agent_2:He is the guy who scored 6 30 yard long touchdowns right? Quite a talented guy agent_1:Yes, he is a wide receiver who has the fifth fasted speed among NFL ball carriers. He goes 21.64 miles per hour. That's pretty fast!	agent_2:that is extremely fast. I never knew that the first NFL playoff game was played on a dirt field belonging to the Hockey team the Blackhawks.
151521	agent_1:They have a great defense; Donald on the Rams is being considered for MVP agent_2:I'm not familiar with him.  What position is he? agent_1:Lineman; Brady is a QB on the Patriots and is the GOAT!	agent_2:I think Mahomes might be having a better year than Brady but that's just my opinion.
57661	agent_1:THey are for sure. And if they get stuck together you cannot separate them agent_2:Haha. I was reading the other day about the winner of the $560 million powerball. The winner was in a big court fight to remain anonymous. agent_1:Yeah that is strange. DO you enjoy reading	agent_2:I do. I don't read as many books as I used to, although I read a good 40-50 articles a day.
90081	agent_2:It's hard to imagine that he actually financed the popularization of country music to keep people from listening to jazz. Like, what did he think was going to happen? agent_1:I do not know, it is not like the money was going to change people's preference, I do not think at least agent_2:Right? But jazz was associated with African-Americans, and there are only 2 African-Americans in the country music hall of fame, so it looks like he divide that Ford promoted has continued to this day. I wonder why.	agent_1:that is sad though, music should be about uniting people and celebrating everyone
161014	agent_2:Me too; His wife is a supermodel and rich in her own right too. agent_1:Lucky bastard... must be nice to have it all ;) lol... now I'm depressed... agent_2:I don't like many of the new rookie QBs like Baker Mayfield	agent_1:Why what's wrong with them ? lazy primadonnas ? :)
121770	agent_1:Wow, I did not know that. Did you know that John Quincy Adams skinny dipped in the Potomac river? agent_2:Yes, it's a funny story.  A woman named, Anne Royall, wanted an interview with so she went to the river and sat on his clothes to force him out. agent_1:Ha! That would be so embarrasing... She's now seen negatively though. Seems like good old fashion journalism...	agent_2:That would certainly be embarrassing.  I think she was very brave to do something like that to a president. I guess she got a story!
65594	agent_1:I guess he sings in the new movie. I want to check it out. Do you like comedy movies in general? agent_2:Ahhh yes he forms part of a band in that movie because it's made by the guy from the Lemonheads. I do like comedies, do you? agent_1:You are exactly right. And yes I love comedy. I find it interesting that The Green Lantern was supposed to be a comedy ....lol	agent_2:I did not know that, can't really see that
147103	agent_1:Cant beat the chicken wings while watching the big game on a big tv with a beer in your hands. agent_2:It's a shame most of  those boys don't make more money than what they do.  I read in the paper that an engineer can expect to make more in their lifetime than the average player does.   agent_1:I think they are paid pretty well. Even if they are only there one year. They stilll make more than the average joe does.	agent_2:True, well it's been nice chatting with you this afternoon.  I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
14222	agent_1:Probably in the time that he lived Im sure there wasnt as much to do as there is now lol  agent_2:Yeah, but i imagine that it was a bit of work to write with quill and ink on parchment. he must have written pretty quick. agent_1:Oh right,  thats a good point. Do you like the universe?	agent_2:The universe is big and impersonal, but it has been pretty good to me so far. what do you think?
152633	"agent_1:It was, that was such a boring game haha. Saints should have been in it! agent_2:It was boring I agree, are you a fan of the Saints? if not do you have a favorite team? agent_1:I don't really have a favorite team, I ""play""  a lot of fantasy football though. The Saints got screwed over on that lack of pass interference by the endzone in the NFC championship."	agent_2:They did? I didnt follow the NFC this season. Do you know who Matt Patricia is?
152740	agent_1:oh c'mon, gender equality in sports ;) no way, they are changing with the boys :) lol agent_2:yeah right!  the feminist would have a field day! LMAO  What the... Tom Brady's wife makes more than he does! agent_1:Yeah... google how she looks... You'll understand... ;) lol	agent_2:no need.. got her in my brain :p ALright... i'm out!  have a good one!
57546	agent_2:The projection and analysis of these earnings is very important for the movie industries and knowing the interest of the fans. So only they are promoting the films in various way. agent_1:Interesting. The movie Trojan War had a budget of $15 million and only made $309 at the box office. Seems like that is wrong. agent_2:Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of audiences and giving joy to them. Today entertainment plays major role in stress relief.	agent_1:I think so too. In Britain around 50BC, they bred chickens for entertainment and not food.
122182	agent_1:Glad you agree.  Apparently, the first president of Zimbabwe was called President Banana.  I wonder why. agent_2:That's funny. I would hate to have that nickname. The presidents guest house is actually bigger than the white hosue. agent_1:I heard about the guest house.  I think it should be the other way around.  The White House should be bigger than the guest house.	agent_2:I agree. Until 1805, the runner up for president automatically became the vice president.
87971	agent_2:Jimmy Butler's future with the Timberwolves is going to be discussed with Coach Tom Thibodeau agent_1:Is that a positive thing for him ? Not sure what is going on in NBA universe... ;) sorry agent_2:Sounds like he will be a free agent 	agent_1:cool beans ;) I've heard that in 39 out of 50 states, the highest paid state employee is either a college football or basketball coach.
125207	"agent_2:Ahah well then maybe you'd like ""Nuntii Latini"". It's a free news program broadcasted by a Finnish radio station, it's interesting because it's conducted entirely in classical Latin. agent_1:I like free programs, but in Latin?  I do not think so.  It is a difficult language. agent_2:Oh I definitely think so. It's almost ironic considering radios are more simple than we think. In WWII I believe soldiers contructed them using just a razorblade and pencil."	agent_1:I heard about that.  Do you know if average people can make radios at home using just a pencil and a razor blade as the diode?  I wonder how simple it is.
29764	agent_1:Yeah, I had no idea! I'm not a huge fan, but I can enjoy the odd game! Who do you root for? agent_2:I always root for Golden State and Steph. agent_1:That's pretty cool! I was so surprised to find out that Curry doesn't get the highest salary though, not even close!	agent_2:No he doesn't but he does have what could end up being a one billion dollar deal with Under Armour.
62369	agent_2:Oh ok i have heard of that. When the PS4 was released it sold 1 million consoles in the first 24 hrs. Wow, yeah i bought one too. lol! agent_1:PS4 is also great as well. Personally, the music and graphics of PlayStation is really great agent_2:Yes i agree technology has come a long way and i don't think it's slowing down at all. It's already the fastest selling console in history. 	agent_1:I wonder what the future of games are. Did you know PS3 are being used to research black holes?
40789	agent_1:did you know that Jeff Bezos made a clock in a mountain? Like why did he do that that seems weird and a waste of money agent_2:Well I am sure he has plenty of cash to spare given that Amazon is the largest internet retailer in the world by revenue and market cap agent_1:ya that is true, like yes the clock will run for 10,000 years but I don't see what the benefit of that would be	agent_2:Perhaps its so that our descendants will have a perfect on time source of time for years to come
46816	agent_1:She went through it all and came out a star. Has she won any awards? agent_2:Not sure, but she is the highest selling solo female artist in country music history. agent_1:That's great! Is she married? Does she have kids?	agent_2:Shania Twain has been married at least twice.    Her first divorce was covered extensively by the tabloids.
64084	agent_2:33% wow, that sure is a lot, wow, how many subscribers do you  think the service has by now? agent_1:More than I can count... They also spend 20 times more on postage than they do for bandwidth. agent_2:I wonder why, isnt Netflix an online service only?	agent_1:I thought so... I may have read an old article.  I'm surprised to learn that Dr. Seuss was afraid of kids!?  He's made so many of them happy.
72347	agent_1:Hi do you like Johnny depp? agent_2:I am a huge fan of his, actually.  What's your favorite Johnny Depp movie? agent_1:I loved him in the pirates of the Caribbean. You?	agent_2:I would have to say mine is Chocolat or Cry Baby.  What did you think of the Willy Wonka remake?
867	agent_2:No I am not. How about you? agent_1:No I am not, I am a Libertarian. Maybe one of us will win soon, it hasn't happened since 1853. agent_2:Well I am just hoping Trump doesn't win a second term next year, but with how corrupt everything is now it is looking like a very likely outcome.	agent_1:I do too, I don't particularly like him. Did you vote last election
128808	agent_2:Really? That's crazy, it's been such a long time since that movie came out. I heard that Frozen 2 is coming out sometime this year, I bet since Jay-z is so famous he knows some of the people working on that movie.  agent_1:He probably does. Maybe he should run for office.  agent_2:Oh wow, I'm sure he would win if he were to do that. That would be interesting to see. Then again he has so much money he probably thinks that would be a waste of his time. 	agent_1:He could end up one of the wealthier presidents, but not the wealthiest. I wonder what nickname they would give him.
144097	agent_2:It would. I wonder about that too. And if a flag of that weight fell on someone, they could be injured. I wonder if that has ever happened. agent_1:It seems like we would have heard about that.  Is that just for american football, or do they have flags at other football games in other countries.  Of course what they call football, we might call soccer or rugby. agent_2:Yes. In some countries, football is used to mean both soccer and rugby, which sounds confusing.	agent_1:I like all 3 of the games, rugby, football and soccer.  They all offer something different and interesting.
125514	agent_1:I did watch it.  Do you think that the Saints would have been in it if that call had gone differently in the nfc championship game? agent_2:I think the right teams were there. But I didn't like Maroon 5's performance.  I think they should have gotten a celebrity that would  garner more fame and attention from the crowd. agent_1:I agree with that. I didn't even watch the halftime show.  Speaking of the saints, did you know that their cheerleaders have to leave a restaurant if a player comes in?	agent_2:I think that is a good strategy for keeping everyone focused on the game. They can play video games in their spare time instead! The 3d images of today are impressive and quite an art form!
69316	agent_1:It should be a right for everybody. I can't believe 7 percent of people read the buyer's terms and conditions. I would have guess nobody did that. agent_2:The buyer's terms and conditions for internet service? agent_1:products and services as well. I know I always just scroll to the bottom and sign or click ok haha.	agent_2:Yeah same. I mean even if there's something objectionable in there are you going to not use a common app or service because of it? Probably not.
22343	agent_1:WOW! That is fast. Did you know a hockey player was traded for $1 in 1993?  agent_2:Sound like what I would be worth.  Another track kid, Donovan Louis did 55 meters in 6.43 seconds and a long jump of 24-3.25. What an athlete.  agent_1:Well apparently that player went on to win 4 Stanely Cups. 	agent_2:That showed 'em.  It's kinda sad that in 39 of 50 states, the highest paid state employee are college football or basketball coaches.  Education seems to be of secondary importance.
71881	"agent_1:the ""rotary phone"" brings back memories.  all these technological changes...so amazing how we move from one thing to another and we get more and more advanced with technology. agent_2:You seem to know a lot of interesting things that I have never thought about. agent_1:i do some reading.  here is a memory: i clearly remember getting my first phone when i lived with my parents.  and it had the # button.  i had absolutely no idea what it was all about.  now it is common place."	agent_2:I need to research more about lots of interesting things.  Nice talking to you and thank you for your valuable and interesting information.
18132	agent_1:That needs to be liked lol. I feel that is illegal in general, what do you think.  agent_2:Having a like button? I don't know about illegal in general, but it certainly makes for a situation where only folks who agree with you tend to make their voice heard. My friends list is extremely divided between liberal and conservative friends, and they don't tend to talk to each other because of how polarized the discussions are. Do your friends tend to have heated discussions on facebook or stay quiet? agent_1:I have some friends that say a lot on facebook and some that argue. I sit behind my computer and what the awkwardness unfold and stay quiet, you?	agent_2:Lol, I'm so quiet that I tend to never post or even react to anyone's comments, but I guess I still want to have a Facebook and see what people have to say. I have a particular friend who always shares news articles, so it's like the only way I get the news anymore.
125451	agent_2:YEAH. NOW I AM READING ABOUT IT agent_1:She is so good she can basically sell herself (in reference to her books that is) lol agent_2:YOU ARE RIGHT. I AM SURE THAT I AM GOING TO ENJOY READING THIS BOOK.	agent_1:The plot has soo many twist i'm not sure where to start.  Like did you see where the main character has a brain tumor and suffers from amnesia.  Is it that she may be the murderer?
87329	agent_2:Wow, that is tough question.  TV and movies are great, but I  alos enjoy plays and dance.  Entertainment is such a broad category, that it is hard to choose. agent_1:Yeah , entertainment is an important part of our lives. It changes with time, roman were entertained with breeding chicken. agent_2:What a srange form of entertainment.  I guess anything that can hold the attention of people could be considered entertainment.	agent_1:Yeah, what shows are you watching on television ?
28907	agent_2:more rap artist is here but i love this person i\only agent_1:For any specific reason ? Voice ? Lyrics ? agent_2:i love this voice and lyrics also 	agent_1:great talking, Happy Holidays !
158008	agent_1:Yeah, I was scared too when I started driving at first, but after a while, I got used to it. At any rate, do you use a telephone? agent_2:Phones are not a good substitute for a vehicle, but they help me get around.  agent_1:Yeah, that is true. Did you know that New York's area code is 212 because it was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone?	agent_2:That makes sense. New York has always prided itself on itself.
10106	agent_1:Yeah like in the movies, AI can beat our brains they even crushed all human records on a game called the puzle game 2048 agent_2:Yeah, Chess and Go as well. Did you see the movie Ex Machina? agent_1:I didnt, whats it about?	agent_2:It's about this guy who wins a developer competition and gets to spend a weekend with the CEO on this remote island. It turns out the guy was meant to be the human component for the CEO's AI testing.
14341	agent_1:Me too! I find the movie house too expensive. I like to watch on my couch and fall asleep too! agent_2:That's me, I miss about 30% of everything we watch.  I've been on the couch as my wife has watched every episode of Game of Thrones, I saw about three hours worth.  agent_1:Ha! How can you fall asleep for Game of Thrones though? That show is so good!	agent_2:Just tired at the end of the day.  Even things I want to watch on Netflix I pass out to.  Usually because it's getting close to 12am, which is when Netflix uses 33% of all of America's bandwidth.
26175	"agent_1:but quickly restored them after backlash from the music industry, which reportedly included artists such as Kendrick Lamar. agent_2:Rapping (or rhyming, spitting, emceeing, MCing) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates ""rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular"" agent_1:apping (or rhyming, spitting, emceeing, MCing) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates ""rhyme, rhythmic speech,"	"agent_2:Rapper tupac shakur's music is in the library of congress of ""cultural significance."""
125564	agent_2:Taking things a bit extreme there.  I agree it isnt good for them to be up playing, but making it illegal... agent_1:Well, I would have probably been under the jail, because I know I played alot after midnight, when I was supposed to be sleeping!  lol agent_2:I liked sleep too much even then.  But I did spend many summers saving the princess.  	agent_1:Hey, I had the Pacman pattern memorized.  Do you watch NFL football?
10693	agent_1:Interesting, I wonder if he takes medicines during the scenes.  agent_2:I would think so! It is crazy how human's work, isn't it?  agent_1:Yeah, it is. Apparently they lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago. 	agent_2:And yet we still have some. Humans' adaptation for persistence hunting makes them among the best distance runners among all running animals.
106457	agent_2:No, not yet. I want to. Have you? agent_1:Not yet... I'm not the biggest fan of that dude... I mean I loved him in Mr. Robot, but I don't see him as Freddy... ;( agent_2:I'm curious to see him in the part though. Is there any artists you want to see a film like this made about?	agent_1:hmmm... Syd Barret maybe...  or Nick Cave ! ;)
14973	agent_2:Maybe those cobblers can make ballet shoes. They go through 4 pairs a week! agent_1:Yeah that is a lot of shoes. Do you know how the keep them smelling fresh? agent_2:Febreeze?	agent_1:Hahaha yes great option. But also tea bags
130687	agent_1:True, most of the content on YouTube is uploaded by individuals but media corporations including CBS, BBC, Vevo and Hulu offer some of their material via Youtube as part of the YouTube partnership program.  So it carries a lot of entertainment value from all over. agent_2:There is also a 70 full episodes of the joy of painting, I guess theres content for everyone agent_1:Even videos deemed potentially inappropriate are available only to registered users affirming themselves to be at least 18 years old. So, yes, there's content for everyone.	agent_2:Yeah even unregistered users can watch videos on the site so not a lot of barriers there.
91419	agent_2:I love that pill popping guy agent_1:yeah. the show became so popular that he was getting paid $700 000 per episode agent_2:Wow now that's some serious green backs. I hear Jim Carrey doesn't make drama anymore. 	agent_1:really? do you know why is that so?
143395	agent_2:There would have to be regular training. Shooting is skill that has to be maintained through steady practice. agent_1:I feel like the training is the huge part of it. They need to continue training beyond the academy and offer it to officers consistently, especially when procedures are changed. agent_2:I was reading McDonald's offered drive-through for soldiers. I thought it would be about cars and more sales per store.	agent_1:Yeah that's really interesting. That goes hand in hand with the windshield firing. You sometimes have to cater to what/who you're interacting with.
91678	"agent_1:Yeah, with Parker and Ginobli both leaving, and Popovich possibly leaving too. agent_2:Also, Leonard is injured and demanding mo' money.  Free agency just proved there is no ""team loyalty""  -- it's all about money... agent_1:Yep, very few athletes play the game for the love of the game anymore."	agent_2:I didn't know Popovich coached the Spurs for over 20 years.
83480	agent_2:Hi, what do you think of Nicki Minaj making history with 100 appearances on the Billboard 100 chart? agent_1:oh im not crazy about her , that tells u something about music, how much i miss the 80s agent_2:Me too.  Seems like things are tracked differently so someone could just put a song on repeat and the singer gets huge credits even if someone isn't really listening to it.	agent_1:its just sad how music has changed
125870	agent_2:Totally, did you know that new york's area code is 212 because it was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone agent_1:I did not know that! I love that Unicef donates a day of clean water for every minute you don't use your phone!  agent_2:I think they only did that for a specific month back in 2014. Crazy that a $5 donation can provide 200 days of clean water to someone	agent_1:200 days?! wow! It's hard to believe there are cables laying on the bottom of the ocean floor that carry phone and internet data.
113785	agent_2:oh I would totally wear that even today! I wonder if its worth any money now agent_1:I bet it is! I wonder if they have any Pilgrim clothing haha, they wore all black for special occasions, I love black clothing. agent_2:haha ya I would still ilke to see these colorful clothes they wore though, how come you dont see any pictures of that? haha	agent_1:Hahaha, I have no idea! Would be interesting though! I wonder what color of clothing the president wears when he is playing Golf?
70439	agent_2:Now that is a surprise. Did he write anything else? agent_1:It says something about Oedipus as well. I'm guessing that's some sort of God.  agent_2:You've got me there. I just always think of Caesar as a conquer and nothing else.	agent_1:Lol...me too. In the 1950's a judge tried to ban science fiction because it featured a black character.
83275	agent_2:Yeah me too. Did you hear of Truman not wanting his picture taken on the dumbo ride? agent_1:Yes he did not want to be associated with the republicans  agent_2:Yeah, he just wanted to be as much removed from them as possible	agent_1:Yeah. It was nice chatting with you
162049	agent_2:I bet he is. 5 presidents have been elected while still losing the popular vote.  agent_1:Thats interesting. US politics can be very confusing. Up until 1805 the runner up in the election automatically became the vice president. Can you imagine Hillary Clinton as Trumps Vice president? agent_2:I agree - that would be crazy. The last US president to speak a foreign language was FDR.	agent_1:I would think foreign languages standards should be at least semi fluent in certain category's for the president.
115086	agent_1:I would if I could afford it, but I'm no king! I lived in Europe when I was a kid, so I'd love to go back, and my sister-in-law is Chinese, so if I visited both places that would practically be a world trip right there if I could take it. agent_2:Well have you ever been to Mackinac Island? I'm actually from Michigan so I've been there, they don't have cars but they only use horses, and the whole island smells like horse poop LOL agent_1:I've vacationed in Michigan because my dad's parents live there, but I've never been to Mackinac Island. From your description, I don't think my nose wants me to go, haha!	agent_2:Nope I wouldn't go if I were you haha. On a different topic what do you like in terms of music? Do you have a favorite album
64212	agent_1:Hello, Lets talk about the internet. The name for the 3 horizontal line menu is a hamburger button.  agent_2:In modern internet is the beginning of the transition and development of commercial network result in digital money transfer due to internet. agent_1:If you ever go to the peak of mt. Everest there is 3g cell phone service waiting for you. 	agent_2:The people use internet to buy product and sometime food also. It is the best friend to human and develop to it.
941	agent_1:Yea I think so too, our governor is republican but not a far right one. There was only one governor who opposed internment of japanese people in ww2 agent_2:yeah, during wartime it is hard to stop people from acting on hate. i expect that could happen again soon if there is war with chna. agent_1:for sure, I am sure something big will happen in our lifetime. It is bound to happen. I still can't believe schwarzenegger was governor	agent_2:he had notoriety to launch a campaign. if you are rich, famous, tall, etc you can run for govt. i figure the future is all about marketing, not content.
49314	agent_1:But could have been also a disaster, if it was a show I would not be surprised that it would be in the 100 shows canceled by Comedy Central.  agent_2:That's a good point. Another comedy I enjoyed was Incredibles 2. Did you like that one? I loved how the present day events set in  movie was from the 1960s! agent_1:I did not saw that movie, but I like anything set in the 60s, who made that film ?	agent_2:It's a Pixar movie that was distributed by Disney Pictures. Also, Brad Bird both wrote and directed the film! It's a great superhero movie with a star cast of actors who voiced roles from Samuel L. Jackson to to Holly Hunter!
158392	agent_2:that rivalry with baltimore was pretty good there for a long time to though. agent_1:Yes.  I agree.  Have you ever watched Pittsburgh Dad on youtube?   agent_2:I havnt. I have heard it was good though. Gonna have to check it out.	agent_1:Definately check it out!  His next door neighbor is a Baltimore fan.  You'll laugh your butt off!  Did you know that the Browns QB Baker Mayfield once almost quit football in order to pursue a full time competitive gaming career?
75908	agent_1:Parents of newborn babies have it hard, I heard airlines often have to apologize to parents because of rude crew members agent_2:That doesn't sound like much fun to be those parents having to travel.  agent_1:It doesn't sound like fun it sounds really complicated, I think airlines should learn from incidents like the one that happen in Bala	agent_2:Yeah I would have to agree, do you travel much yourself?
37488	agent_1:Speaking of rap, how familiar are you with Aubrey Drake Graham? agent_2:Who is that, Drake? I did not know that Aubrey was his first name! agent_1:Initially finding fame as an actor in Degrassi, he pursued rap and released Comeback Season and So Far Gone before debuting with Thank Me Later with Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment	"agent_2:He is full of surprises. During one UK tour in 2011, he spent an ""obscene amount of money"" to buy children's classic books, first editions."
42603	agent_2:It has 3 season right now. It was on syfy first but it got too expensive for syfy to continue to make so Amazon took it, so now you can watch all the season on prime video, fourth season will come out sometime this year. agent_1:Ok thanks for the recomndation I will watch that show for sure, did you know Blockbuster had the chance to buy Netflix at one point agent_2:Yeah but I am glad they turned it down because they couldn't even keep themselves from going under, I hate to think where Netflix would be if they had bought it.	agent_1:Maybe as a really expensive service, Blockbuster charged a lot of money for its serice and the late fees made me really angry
30836	agent_1:Hey hows it going? Are you a Disney fan? agent_2:I am!  I liked the Frozen that came out in 2013. agent_1:Thats cool. Yea Frozen is a great movie! its Disney's 53rd animated feature film and its another classic	agent_2:Jennifer Lee, the writer and co-director, is the first woman director of a Walt Disney animation studios feature film.
24912	agent_2:Nice. Not nice enough to make me want to be Canadian, but it is good that they have at least one thing to boast about!  Like the New England high school hockey team that beat the woman's USA Olympic team... agent_1:lol  Are you a basketball fan?  I am...my favorite shot is the granny shot. agent_2:In Texas, the Granny bow-hunting season starts in March. But Texans are proud of their Spurs, and that Tim Duncan!  He sacrificed money to stay in college for 4 years before dominating in the NBA!	agent_1:Nice!  Physicists probed that shoot granny style is the absolute best technique to consistently score points from the free throw line.  That's why it's my shot.  I'm too short to get anywhere close to the hoop when the game is on.
18539	agent_2:People think that Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago agent_1:It was probably longer than that. Who can say for sure? agent_2:I don't think anyone here today can be sure.  But more than 80% of the earth's natural forests have been destroyed already	agent_1:Yes. Deforestation is a tragedy. Corporate greed is ruining this beautiful planet.
103190	agent_2:It is.  I would like to travel to Mackinac Island.  No cars on the island sounds refreshing.  agent_1:I agree that would be a nice change of pace. If you are into flame throwers on your car, then South Africa is the place to go.  Its legal there.  Crazy! agent_2:That would be a great way to deter thieves..	agent_1:Exactly!  It would be like having your own Batmobile
163307	agent_1:I guess entertainment is different to every person. Some people might like to watch a slow football game, or others would prefer an opera, or dancing. agent_2:True.  All I know is it's not for me.   agent_1:Yes I hear you on that.	agent_2:Give me a nintendo though and I'm set.   To bad they discontinued them in September of 2003
77812	agent_1:Wow. He had a vivid imagination. agent_2:yeah i am an artist but i think doing that besides a janitor job is a talent beyond imagination.  agent_1:He was very skilled.	agent_2:people are really talented be it fashion, the Victoria secrets of this world, right?
27662	agent_1:I hope that in future movies they explore some of the alternate universes and time lines that end up intersecting like they do in the comics.  agent_2:Me too! Who is your favorite character? agent_1:I like captain america. I think he is quite the character to look up to. Although I love what they did with the Black Panther character in the origin film.	agent_2:Yeah, Black Panther is my favorite,  Did you know he's the richest Superhero?
59441	"agent_2:back in days polo shirts are invented for tennis ..  some things have weird history agent_1:Yeah, they should be called ""tennis shirts"".   agent_2:In china they once wore as many shirts to pop the collars ... was fashion that time should have been very stuffy "	agent_1:Funny.  I like the business attire in Hawaii - aloha shirts.
116328	agent_1:I have no idea, its a rare episode there is only one. Did you ever watch Thomas the Tank Engine? agent_2:I did as a kid. I heard a lot of stars did some video acting for the character agent_1:Yeah the show has great narrators big names like Ringo Starr, George Carlin and also Alec Baldwin	agent_2:Thats really cool. Amazing they werent just cameo parts either. 52 episodes each
110107	agent_1:I think it would be entertaining as heck and make the government a great reality TV show. Not much gets done in the WHite House anyway agent_2:Honestly, that would just make me sad. Although, I'm sure the president of Indonesia would call for a great reality show as well. He has three pop albums out! agent_1:The man must have a great voice Maybe Trump could consult him on how to handle his own pop career. Trump might need to get reelceted to get out three albums though	agent_2:Oh god, I hope not! I do not like the idea of a republican president.
33858	agent_1:I don't know but it does seem like it would take a while.  Say, do you like going to concerts? agent_2:I do like to go to concerts, but I usually don't have time or money. What about you? agent_1:Same here. Some concerts are really expensive these days.  There's an ancient roman amphitheatre that is still used as a concert venue. I bet tickets to that are expensive.	agent_2:I wonder how comfortable the seats are. I think that it must be pretty cool though. Anyway, great chat!
64769	agent_2:I agree. So, in other thoughts I have been thinking about dogs. It amazes me that the dog is related to wolves. In fact the dog and wolf are ancestors.  agent_1:I love dogs. I can't believe there are 12 different blood types for dogs. agent_2:Wow! I did not know. Some places have dog vending food machines for homeless dogs.	agent_1:I saw that. It's pretty cool because it's in exchange for plastic bottles so it also helps out the environment.
25612	agent_1:Hello,  have you ever watch the movie Titanic? agent_2:I did, I watched it on 1997 when it first come out and at least a couple more times, what about you? agent_1:Yes,  I have seen it great movie!  	agent_2:It is a great movie, it made me cry more than once lol, an epic romance and then disaster film
14726	agent_2:Yeah, apparently they like to be petted because it's similar to the way penguin groom (or preen) each others feathers.  I guess like other animals, it's a bonding experience.  agent_1:That is neat.  I wold like to meet Eddie the penguin! agent_2:any reason you like that particularly one?	agent_1:He is 2 and already very interactive with people I hear.
109583	agent_2:Is he still planning to finish his masters? Is he as good as brad johnson who managed to throw a touchdown pass to himself? agent_1:I dont know, but I think he did as its been a couple of years now, and really? thats amazing I wonder how that went. agent_2:I am sure you can look it up on the internet considering the vast amount of information, resources, and services it provides.	agent_1:I know! the internet is full of information I dont know what we would do without it.
29228	agent_1:I wonder if she invited the Jazz Orchestra that currently tops the charts in Pakistan agent_2:maybe!  Do you like the piano? agent_1:Yea, it's real cool the same piano was used in Bohemian Rhapsody and Hey Jude	agent_2:Thats really cool.  I still havent seen that movie,  I really want to,  It looks good.  I read there was a mysterious mute man that was found in england who could only communicate using a piano
154585	agent_2:Yes Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland. Interesting game i bet. agent_1:I bet it was almost comical in how lopsided it was, college is always like that, but not to that extent agent_2:Yeah. Did you know that the University of Iowa's locker room is painted pink, on the visiting teams side of course?	agent_1:I did not know that, that is hilarious, I wonder if their home record shows that it makes any type of difference?
99491	agent_1:really? why a crocodile? did he have a lot of teeth? LOL I think the world of tennis is a bit obscure for me. agent_2:Ha ha I'm not sure. But I assume that is how the Lacoste logo came to be. agent_1:that makes sense. well, i have learned much today about shirts and hats. thanks for the chat!	agent_2:Yes I too have learned a lot and enjoyed our conversation. Bye!
60277	agent_2:I did. I got some home decor stuff I had been wanting.  You know, Jeff Bezos founded the company on July 5th.  Clearly he was not tired from the 4th of July celebrations. agent_1:Ha! Amazon did save me from Super Bowl celebrations.  I'm not a big football so watch some Amazon shows like that Jack Ryan series instead.  Dang it. Forgot the actor's name. agent_2:I think I know what you're talking about. The guy used to be in that show the office I think.  What I need now is an Echo so I can ask Alexa!	agent_1:Yeah that would be helpful.  I usually go to Wikipedia or IMDB.  I read somewhere Amazon even owns IMDB.  Man they're everywhere.  Wonder where their headquarters are?  Think I need to get a job there.
161183	agent_2:It is one of the few sports I couldn't get into.  Id play for fun, in pick up games, but watching it is kind of dull.  Another sport with long game times and no action. agent_1:Yep I agree with you. One thing is that in Canada they don't call kickball kickball. They call it soccer-baseball. that sounds really stupid to me haha agent_2:It kinda sounds like a name you give something to somehow make it more legitimate.  There was once this 17 year old female pitcher that got banned from pro ball because she struck out Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig back to back.  Id be signing her not banning her.	agent_1:I know right! That's so impressive I wonder what happened to her. What other cool thing is that a baseball manager can actually play for the team if they're needed. That's why they were the uniform
18711	agent_2:Well, that happens, do you remember the Old Queer Eye for the Straight Guy? agent_1:Lol yea, is that still on? agent_2:They have a new version, looks like, I guess Carson and all of them are old now. Nice to meet you.	agent_1:Oh yea, apparently it's on netflix and was nominated. Well it was nice talking with you too
116215	agent_2:Oh my! I wonder if that diet trend will ever make it big like I see some of these other diets. But horror films also overlap with fantasy, supernatural fiction, and thriller genres so ET was originally scripted as a horror movie. agent_1:Really? Maybe the original script had some heavy breathing on the telephone call ET made when he phoned home. I was mesmerized by ET. Some say watching a horror movie will help you enjoy Art more. agent_2:Oh I forgot about that! I do enjoy art but am also fascinated by the solar system and earth. Did you know Earth is the densest planet in the solar system and also the largest of the four planets?	agent_1:AND politicians are the densest matter on earth, sworn to turn politics in a horror production. And in 2010, the UN appointed an ambassador to extraterrestrials, in preparation for ET's next phone call. It all comes together...
20686	agent_1:Possibly. Or less stress! I would be so stressed auditioning for these parts... agent_2:I can't even imagine it. Plus the pressure to release blockbusters in this day and age. If it doesn't make hundreds of millions you have had a flop.  agent_1:I know. Can you imagine some of the great films of the past that would not be released because they studio might think it would flop?	agent_2:Or how many flops that have made millions from becoming cult classics?
150563	agent_2:Daily. I like to tune into the electromagnetic storms of Jupiter on my radio. Sounds a lot like country music, with a less songs about fishing. agent_1:Wow that is fascinating! Did you know soldiers in wwii made simple radios with just a razorblade and pencil? I wonder how that worked agent_2:Foxhole radios...that brand never caught on. 	agent_1:Well radio has continued to persist despite the dominance of tv. Did you know there is a website you can listen to thousands of classic radio drama episodes for free? Way to keep radio alive!
5285	agent_1:It's also very popular in Latin America. A lot of professional players are from Cuba, Puerto Rico, The Dominican Republic, and Venezuela. agent_2:That is true. I suppose Canada does have influence because in the 1992 world series the US Marine Corps color guard brought in the Canadian flag upside down. agent_1:That must have been embarrassing. Hopefully everyone realized it was a mistake!	agent_2:Well if Babe Ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 and lose the 1926 world series with his team down by one run and everyone still loves him then I am sure it is okay about the flag all those years later.
156742	agent_1:Micelle Obama was in Brooklyn. agent_2:yeah it's a part of her book tour right? Looks like her book is selling extremely well, Im very happy for her agent_1:Yes. Burger king had a promotion where if you unfriend 10 people on facebook you get a free whopper.	agent_2:at what location?
95887	agent_2:for sure lol. Did you know if you ever went to mt everest, you could get cell and internet access at the peak! agent_1:Yes, for my vanity project! I could take selfies at the peak and upload to the cloud. agent_2:right lol! Or to show off on instagram to my 50 followers lol!	agent_1:Yes, that is how it starts, but soon you would have millions! think big! Everest!
48802	agent_2:How does that even work? Sounds like a pat on the back sort of thing really.  agent_1:I'm not even sure, I can't tolerate award shows, they are so boring to me.  agent_2:Yes! they always seem so narcassistic and oh look at me. 	agent_1:Yeah, I hear yah. It is a lot of self love. Well, nice chatting with you.
155408	agent_1:The days of Clinton and Bush dynasties would end. The US president's guest house is larger than the White House. I'm sure that Trump can add a story or ten to the White House to match the size of his ego. Then put up a TRUMP sign and rent out suites to the highest bidder. I bet the Clintons would rent one out to spite him. agent_2:Then I say we should start and make a change and enact that in the States in hopes it would make a difference in the world but I cannot be too gullible and fall for that. The change must come with all of us. It's just hard when we are all in our own little world and plans. We should all come together and organize. There are more of us than them haha agent_1:True, but it seems that politicians are locked into their own fantasies. For example, Indonesia's president has released 3 pop albums while in office. This is the way to a successful musical career? Seems like a distraction. 	agent_2:distraction at its finest, it's what everything around us is. Do you still wonder why people prefer to listen to the suns music? To escape this crazy reality.
164999	agent_2:I mean a high school football stadium in texas with 18K seats cost 60 million to build. Imagine how much it too to build those big college stadiums. agent_1:Yeah! College teams have huge boosters though. Like Oregon has Phil Knight and Oklahoma State has T Booke Pickens... agent_2:These stadiums sure are a large investment. Even the huge american flags alone are 50k a pop	agent_1:That much!!! Holy cow! I wonder how much the pink paint iowa used to paint the visitors locker room cost?
129672	agent_1:That would be nice, the World Cup will be in the US by the year 2026 so maybe thats our chance to win agent_2:THe USA women seem to do better in the World Cup overall.  They have finished third or higher for the last several years agent_1:Yeah since the year 1991 I think, I hope the mens team can reach that level of success one day	agent_2:I think it is interesting that there is a version of soccer that 3 teams play each other
148665	agent_1:I guess it still shows an appreciation for the arts and that we have progressed beyond being hunter gatherers and created civilization.  Do you follow Ryan Stiles at all?  He dropped out of high school to pursue a career in comedy. agent_2:Yes, that name sounds very familiar. Wasn't he the actor/comedian (well one off) from Whose line is it anyway?  agent_1:Oh Maybe.  Interestingly, Jim Carrey doesn't do dramas any more.  He has a new belief that prevents him from playing in movies that don't project positivity.  I wonder what belief system that is?	"agent_2:I was a little surprised to learn about Jim Carrey - hmm don't know if I really believe it or it is just the fad of the day. With that amount of money in the bank I guess you have the luxury to create and follow new ""personal beliefs"". Don't get me wrong. He absolutely has that right - It just sounded a bit odd to me. Do you know of any other comedy guys with that kind of belief?"
67774	agent_1:Yeah and that is usually the problem with electronics is that eventually the batteries don't take a charge and are too expensive to replace, so have to just buy a new one.  agent_2:Mine has lasted over ten years, thats a long time. I may get a Fire tablet this time, I hear it's compatible with the other fire devices. agent_1:Wow, that is really good, I had a laptop that almost lasted that long.  And that is a plus for sure. 	agent_2:I've never hada laptop last longer than five years. I bought my last off of Amazon's returned site.
126445	agent_1:Yeah thats what I was wondering, Like if JFK, Jefferson and Washington were more rich than him, it must be because it is adjusted for inflation, I wonder how much they are worth when that is adjusted, Washington and Jefferson had huge estates and slaves so they were probably worth a ton I would imagine agent_2:Probably true. I wonder how many people who owned slaves would have been called racist. agent_1:Ya I don't know but it would be interesting to go back in time just to see how different things would be, apparently a man in france impersonated a French official and sold the eiffel tower twice, that takes some confidence!	agent_2:Yeh, kind of like selling the Brooklyn Bridge or some swampland in Florida. I would really like to see some serious talk from congress on the situations that are hurting our nation. Maybe some of the new senators and reps will start to move things forward. Do you think so?
126253	agent_2:I don't see why not, people have won awards for much less impressive deeds.  It's become so associated with the sport while watching on tv, I would say it was deserved. agent_1:It would seem that there are more winners and losers than just the team on the field.  ESPN and the NFL it self are money generating companies.  The talent like Benjarvus green-Ellis wins or looses. agent_2:Yeah, I agree with you.  Do you know he never fumbled a ball his entire career?  That's what needs an award.	agent_1:Right, he takes the risk and does an amazing thing.  It is funny to think that soccer has more fans and makes more money than football, basketball, baseball, golf, tennis and hockey combined.
122937	agent_1:I don't mind it as much. At first the ads were annoying, but I guess that's how they make most of their revenue. I'm trying to remember if MySpace had ads agent_2:I will ask my dog. He was the only member of my family that had a Myspace page. Can you believe MS had a chance to buy FB and balked?  Now MS is history and FB is big brother. agent_1:$75 million might have seemed overpriced at the time, but by 2012, Facebook was worth $04 billion	agent_2:Makes me sad. Iceland is rewriting their constitution using Facebook so that the public can weigh in on it. It will be interesting if it is actually helpful, or just a frpe zone..
83065	agent_1:That's a very good question I don't. Maybe the fastest reader, Anne Jones knows the answer to that. agent_2:George RR Martin started selling his stories at a young age to neighborhood kids.  Now is a millionare many times over with the Game of Thrones! agent_1:He is such a genius for creating that story! Did you know in the 18th Century there was a moral panic because of the spread of the reading novels?	agent_2:Maybe they thought it was corrupting to population.
148240	agent_2:Wow that is amazing!  Is it on Netflix? agent_1:Im not sure, I used to watch it on TV but maybe, do you like Jim Carrey? agent_2:Yeah I love Jim Carrey.  I actually just wated Liar Liar again last night,  one of my favorites from him lol 	agent_1:One of my favorites as well, too bad he doesnt make dramas anymore but I have to respect his reason
52701	agent_1:Yes they actually did that up until 1998! agent_2:That's pretty funny. Did you know that 1908 a law was passed limiting the length of hatpins? agent_1:Interesting. I wonder if sufragettes using them as weapons was a big problem?	agent_2:I think that was why. I'd hate to get stabbed with a hat pin.
161383	agent_1:I would have loved to see them beat Michigan for sure. agent_2:Me too! Hilinski was a great quarterback! agent_1:Who is your favorite NFL QB?	agent_2:I really couldn't name only 1 haha who is yours?
11209	agent_2:That is right!! Maybe he started since he was a baby! They love when they hear the beat and they even smile! agent_1:Thats really nice, watching a baby dance, did you like Michael Jackson as a dancer? agent_2:I think he is great!! he has great dance moves and I always remember the way he leaned in smooth criminal	agent_1:I agree with you, he had great moves, do you remember the device he used to lean? he has that one patented
131430	agent_2:Did you know that the president's guest house is bigger than the actual White House? I wonder why that is agent_1:More guests than the usual President's staff?  Dunno.  The pres of Indonesia has 3 pop albums?  Rock on Indonesia... agent_2:That's awesome! What a great way to combine music with politics. I wonder what would happen if our president released a rock album	agent_1:It would get bad reviews even if it was great.  Thanks for the chat, you were great.
117368	agent_1:Have you ever seen Netflix's first original show that they created? It was called Lillehammer and it debuted back in 2012, I wonder how it is agent_2:I haven't! It's probably good, as is most of their shows/movies. I personally really like their documentaries. agent_1:Well I'm just glad that they don't have late fees, it's funny that Netflix was originally created because the guy who invented Netflix was fined $40 for turning in Apollo 13 Late	agent_2:I wonder if his late fee was with Blockbuster, who declined offers to buy Netflix for $50m. Netflix is now worth $2billion.
130523	agent_2:have you ever played in a fantasy congress league? agent_1:No, it is starting to get interesting there so i might draft AOC if I played. agent_2:She's been causing quite a stir lately. More congress people need to be as current as she is. 	agent_1:Exactly.  I think people are afraid of her because she has some new ideas.
136474	agent_2:no i did not. somehow i missed them every time. i dont know how. they were always touring. agent_1:Yes.  They played 2,263 concerts and toured non stop for over 20 years.   agent_2:they must be indestructible. are they cyborgs? how could they do that? 	agent_1:lol Making as much money as they could. lol  Lincoln Park played 324 shows in 2001.  That's a lot of touring.
164606	agent_2:They're definitely not making a smart decision! did you know that those huge American flags at football stadiums actually weigh like a thousand pounds agent_1:That is so much! How do you think they get them up there? agent_2:Yeah I've no idea! And I also don't know why someone would pay $50,000 for one of those flags that's just too much	agent_1:man I will make them one for 25000! Good  chatting with you!
94534	agent_1:Google is a pretty crazy company anyway, instead of mowing the grass at their building they bought a bunch of goats agent_2:really? when was that? agent_1:I have no clue, it couldn't of been before Google was founded in 1998	agent_2:awesome
97986	agent_2:I think it is a seahorse if I am correct.  I think that is such a strange but true fact.  agent_1:Yeah, they are amazing overall. Did you know the male carries the babies? agent_2:No I didn't know that, another interesting fact I guess. Did you know that there is a jellyfish that is essentially eternal?	agent_1:Yeah the scientists have been studying them for so long to crack their secret
50114	agent_1:I heard that Huckleberry Milner and Bob Odenkirk are among the new members of the movie agent_2:They are along with Jonathan Banks.  The movie is set in the 1960s by the way. agent_1:In the 60s really? so it happened before the firs movie?is it also based in the present time?	agent_2:I honestly don't remember. I think both are in the 60s but don't quote me on that.
3249	agent_1:Oh! I really did miss it, thanks for clarifying! Crazy to think how the voice actor who plays Jarvis has never seen any of the films! Wouldn't he be invited to the screening and stuff? agent_2:You would think. Isn't he the guy that plays vision now? agent_1:Oh really? I don't know, I'd have to read up on the books to know. Did you have read the comic books before watching the movies?	agent_2:No I've never been much of a comic book reader. It sounds like there are some interesting storylines that could be turned into movies though.
159066	agent_1:yeah, they are all a little different. did you know bowlers used to make more than football players back in the day agent_2:I believe it. Even today NFL contracts are not guaranteed for some reason. The best player I ever saw was Benjarvus Green-Ellis. He never fumbled once! Never! agent_1:wow, that is impressive. And espn went on to win an emmy	agent_2:For what? I watch a lot of football on espn either on my brand new led tv or even on my old monochrome in my garage..
111905	agent_1:Yeah what a talent I guess. Do you like wearing hats? agent_2:Somewhat. DO you know what the most popular hat in the old west was? agent_1:I think it was the Bowler hat and not the Cowboy has as most of us believe	agent_2:Yes that is it. Do you know how the tipping of the hat originated?
116609	agent_2:Vader and his voice is tough to beat. But I think without Mark Hamell this is a completely different series agent_1:I'm surprised that the filming wasn't more interuppted by his car accident.  agent_2:Its crazy to think that 20th century fox thought this movie was gonna flop. 	agent_1:I wonder how many origin films we are going to get now that disney owns star wars?
151454	agent_1:do you like the NFL? agent_2:I sure do. Did you know women can play too? agent_1:Yes as there is no written rule against them playing 	agent_2:Yes if they qualify, then they get to play
123973	agent_2:I still watch Monty Python on Netflix. It's one of my favorite comedies ever! agent_1:I watch it too. More the movies than Flying Circus but I catch some of it randomly too. Did you ever watch 3rd Rock From the Sun? agent_2:Of course I did ! it only beat out seinfeld, friends and frasier in the 1997 golden globes. what's your favorite genre or comedy? 	agent_1:I can't believe it beat Seinfeld and Friends. That's shocking. If I had to pick a favorite sub-genre within comedy it would be black comedies probably.
84100	agent_1:I also like video games I like to dance, music agent_2:That's cool, ever play Nintendo? agent_1:I used to have a nintendo system yeah	agent_2:It was the best, even though it could only display 54 colors.  Things have really progressed nowadays we have fortnite.
143656	"agent_2:Workaholics is really funny! I love their style of comedy! I think comedy is my favorite  type of thing to watch on television. Do you like any other comedies? agent_1:Furrr Sure! I always thought Reno 911 was hilarious, never though Kung Fu Hustle was that great, but I could definitely be wrong. agent_2:Well, Bill Murray thinks Kung Fu Hustle is great! He calls it ""the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy"".  I think Bill Murray is great, but  I'll have to disagree with him about this!"	agent_1:For sure, he is pretty funny. Jack Black as the Green Lantern? That'd have been pretty wild lol
22278	agent_1:Do you listen to country music? agent_2:I do! do you like Kacey Musgraves? agent_1:I don't really listen to much Country music, but I read that Kacey dropped acid while listening to a Tame Impala record.	agent_2:Yeah i have heard she's the greatest country-singer-for-people-who-don't-listen-to-country-music
85643	agent_1:Yeah. Man they are boring to read, aren't they! agent_2:Yes you are right, I never truly read the entire thing. would you believe I was raised in the country and have seen lightening set trees and fields on fire. agent_1:Interesting. Do you use facebook? 	agent_2:I am a fan of facebook, but I have never  post on facebook or sign in, because I don't trust facebook anymore.
1819	agent_2:Hi! I have two cats, but want a dog. You? agent_1:I like dogs more, but dont mind cats! Google likes dogs more though agent_2:Hah. I see their code of conduct state they are a DOG company. 	agent_1:lol, I heard you can bring you dog to work while working there, kind of discriminating against cats though!
48289	agent_2:Cool!  Do you have a favorite team? agent_1:Yeah I'm a big fan of the Packers if we're talking the NFL.  How about you? agent_2:Patriots, baby, all the way!  So, you like soccer too?	agent_1:Lol, well you sure have dominated for the last decade or so.  Oh yeah, big fan of the english league, follow Liverpool.  How about you?
86037	agent_2:Sorta kinda... Looking at the records, I think Simmons has a slight edge.  agent_1:I think he did win it. But it was his second year. He was injured his first year so it didn't count. agent_2:OK. Did you know that Allen Iverson has a lifetime endorsement for Reebok for $800K a year?	agent_1:Wow. Aren't both of those pretty washed up?
136807	agent_1:Me either. Well just don't smoke near it! agent_2:Want to hear something funny? The first president of zimbabwe was called president banana.  agent_1:Hilarious, I wonder if that is just a jesture to be kind or poke fun at him.	agent_2:Not sure. I like when presidents have side hobbies. The president of indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office.
128070	agent_1:Oh that wasnt tom in toy story. agent_2:Yes, Tom Hanks.  If I was to say that Carlo Burnett appeared in sesame street, what would that mean to you? agent_1:Considering sesame street started so long ago and she was pretty big at the time. It makes sense to me.	agent_2:Yes, it makes sense, and she was the first celebrity to appear on the show.  A guest star on a kids show. Not bad, not bad at all.
26131	agent_2:Yeah. DO you like Eminem/ agent_1:I sure do. Did you know he wanted to become a comic book artist agent_2:Yes his favorite character is spiderman	agent_1:Yeah. Did you know that Busta Rhymes was in the RUgrats movie?
124939	agent_1:I am not sure, I have not seen it. And above all he was not even mentioned agent_2:Ok I'll have to check it out. Have you ever seen the show that 70 show though? They tried to do a remake in the UK, but it was canceled after only 10 episodes, that's a bummer LOL agent_1:Yeah that is a bummer but I guess when you make it verbatim in another country you run that risk	agent_2:Haha that's a good point. I guess humor doesn't always travel across continents LOL did you ever watch the Pokemon episodes when you were a kid though? That is something that definitely crossed the pond and became popular here
138208	agent_2:I've never seen a show but I did hear good things. She actually was nominated for an Emmy for her work on Broadway which I think is cool agent_1:Yes.  The Facts of Life was a great show set in a girls boarding school and it dealt with a lot of tough issues agent_2:Oh that's interesting. Apparently her main character was first created in the show Different Strokes, I did like that show that's funny	agent_1:I liked that show as well.  I did not realize that she had a husband who was bisexual and a son who was autistic.  That made her empathetic for sure
59363	agent_2:That sounds pretty ridiculous to me plus i dont t agent_1:That would be crazy, apparently it is legal to do it in South Africa. They must have a lot of car jackings agent_2:Yeah well, its south africa if there is no law to say otherwise then people will do it.	agent_1:That is a good point. Without a car, do you walk a lot, or take public transportation?
130661	agent_2:I agree, I bet it impresses the guests though! agent_1:Well of course... gotta make them feel good so they donate more money to their campaigns! agent_2:That is true, I was thinking more in the way of foreign ambassadors	agent_1:Yeah... them too!  LOL  I wonder if Trump is up in the top wealthiest presidents with Washington, Jefferson and Kennedy?
83817	agent_1:I actually preferred MySpace. It was more personalized and I didn't argue with people on it nearly as much ha ha. I also don't remember all of the memes passing around false information all of the time on MySpace.  agent_2:MySpace was pretty good does it still work? I might have to google that, its amazing how much Google has grown as well. agent_1:It's still there but it's not what it was at all. They keep trying to reinvent it and I think it's pretty dedicated to up and coming bands trying to get exposure now. Iceland are rewriting their constitution via facebook; allowing the public to make suggestions and alterations. I think that that is a terrible idea. 	agent_2:I think thats a bad idea as well, too many opinions and bad opinions.
162559	agent_1:Thats interesting. Sorry my mistake. What else do u know? agent_2:I see that many people think the quarterbacks are the the leader of the offensive team. I guess they do a lot in a game.  agent_1:Yea each member definately The quarterback also touches the ball on almost every offensive play, and is the offensive player that almost always throws forward passes. So 	agent_2:Did you know who Kyler Murray was before reading the article? I never heard of him. I am so out of touch with some things.
58570	agent_1:Me too. Is that true that you have to fly everywhere?  agent_2:yeah Iceland has no public rail system so they have to use domestic flights to go between any major towns. agent_1:Interesting. Who was the first king to travel around the world? 	agent_2:his name was King kalakaua and he was from Hawaii. Did you know Jupiters moon Ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun?
123764	agent_1:I love the box office, have you heard of Disneys Treasure Planet? agent_2:Never heard of it. But that probably explains why it was one of the most expensive box office flops of all time! agent_1:right, i think the budget was like 15,000,000 and only made 309 dollars! i want to see it and see why 	agent_2:Wow what a bust! Sounds like the silence of the lambs did pretty well on opening day even though it was released on Valentine's Day!
110793	agent_1:Yes. It seems like he is performing quite a bit against the expectations about the US citizens. Especially when you take into consideration all of the recent decisions he has made to ease sanctions on Russian companies for example. It is an interesting time for the US right now.  agent_2:Did you hear Russia gave delegates and heads of state thumb drives and charges that had viruses agent_1:I have not heard about that. I'll have to look into that. Did you watch the president's state of the union on Tuesday?	agent_2:I did not. Was not interested in anymore demands for a wall
9471	agent_2:i used to go to concerts when i was younger. dont have the time or money now. LOL You? agent_1:Haha same here! What's your favorite one that you remember? agent_2:I saw Rush a couple of times. that was great. they were so good live.	agent_1:I bet! Can you believe Linkin Park did 324 concerts in 2001 alone?
96975	agent_1:that is wild, or that humans can regrow ribs, I wonder if other animals can regrow their ribs? Might be more human to harvest animal ribs instead of killing them for it? we could have infinite BBQ Ribs! agent_2:Wow1 CRAZY! Hahahaaa....spare ribs.....hahahaa agent_1:haha sounds tasty haha, did you know there are 750 episodes of pokemon? I watched some as a kid but didn't know there were that many	agent_2:That's a lot of episodes! I have seen a few. I did like The Simpsons and there was 1 episode where Bart was not in it once nor mentioned....weird.
45733	agent_2:I agree. He was smart to turn the $10M offer from Reebok down. Seems to be a smart business man too! agent_1:Yep I agree with you! It's crazy how good he was even in High School, I can't believe that his high school would charge people money to watch him play LOL up to $100 a ticket agent_2:I kind of find that gross that people would capitalize on a high school basketball game. But supply and demand... How can Judge Judy be the second highest paid celebrity?	agent_1:I know right! Kind of shocking know that LeBron James is number one, you would think it would be a big movie star like Tom Hanks or whatever
19008	"agent_2:That is a good story. nothing typical or cliched about that. has she won any awards? agent_1:I am not sure. I think she has. I usually read by author and I should know. I will have to look that up. agent_2:Do you read SF? The term ""robotics"" was accidentally coined by science fiction author isaac asimov in 1941."	agent_1:I enjoy Asimov but that is not typically my genre. Some of the science fiction portrayed on the old Star Trek series is coming true. Look at their communicators for instance.
95113	agent_1:Yeah that is very true, I wonder who is in charge of selecting this, it can't be by group vote.  agent_2:I don't know.  It may be a vote.  Lot's of youngsters in the DoD.  Did you know the Earth is running out of helium?  It will by the end of this century! agent_1:Yeah I think I read that a few years back, that will be too bad!  I wonder what all the helium business will do to replace it?	agent_2:Another reason to develop fusion.  Did you know when the Earth first formed, a day was only 5.5 hours long?  Lot's of paid overtime?
481	"agent_1:I don't. Tell me more. agent_2:He was asked why he would endorse a Democrat, and he said because republicans buy shoes too.  I thought it was funny.  agent_1:Haha, that is funny! Nevada is the only state to have a ""none of these candidates"" voting option for presidential elections."	agent_2:Yeah I think the Nevada voting laws are quite odd.
43598	agent_2:I wonder if Shaq ever played there? now he is one tall black! Althiough he never was very good at shooting the long ball, scoring just once from the 3-point line his entire career. agent_1:Yeah it is called the highest court in the land. I wonder if people who work they use it a lot agent_2:I hear Ruth Bader Ginsberg can jam it and hang from the rim. She sure is hanging in the there.	agent_1:for sure. babe ruth was apparently the most famous golfer in the us once
45698	agent_1:for sure, it seems like everyone is leaving oakland, like the raiders. Steph Curry does good work for the community and afar agent_2:Yea, it's crazy all the good he does and as of 2015 Curry was only the 4th highest salary on the team agent_1:Wow! Now he is first or second if I believe right, more than Durant. It was so nice chatting with you!	agent_2:Well he should since Curry was the 2015 mvp
453	agent_1:Yeah I've wondered that as well. I don't look forward to working that long! Earth will also be helium free by the end of the 21st-century. No more balloons for us! agent_2:I wonder if clowns will be out of jobs at that time as well haha. We do have to thank Jupiter though, they save us from many asteroids coming our way! agent_1:Do they really? I'm not really familiar with that concept. One sad statistic is that more than 80% of the earths natural forest have already been destroyed.	agent_2:That is so sad! We are destroying the planet we live on! That is even more sad because the world is 71 percent water anyways!
141464	agent_2:I do.  I love the series! agent_1:Me too. Did you know managers can actually play which is the reason they wear uniforms? agent_2:Yeah, I wonder how many times that has actually happened.  	agent_1:I bet it hasn't maybe happened a handful of times.
38427	agent_2:Yes it is boring.  That's probably why I wasn't aware the US has won so many medals. agent_1:haha yup, I guess there is a super powerful swimsuit too, it had to be banned becasue it was too good agent_2:Maybe it had little microscopic fins.  I hadn't heard that before.	agent_1:lol that could be! I wonder how fast I could be in that suit, maybe it had a propellar too
78089	agent_1:Oh! that's interesting. The Globetrotters don't tone down their defense. agent_2:No they do not. They are an impressive team. I was surprised to learn that Shaq only recorded one three point score in his entire career. For such a big player I thought there would have been much more.  agent_1:Okay, that's nice. thank you very much.	agent_2:You are very welcome.
33673	"agent_1:I do. Did you know that rapper Tupac's music is in the Library of Congress of ""cultural significance""? agent_2:Yes I did, and was surprised by that! The word ""rap"" has been used in england since 16th century which means ""lightly strike"" and now describes quick speech. i guess that makes sense. agent_1:Well I guess that makes sense. Are you familiar with the 1998 Rugrats movie?"	agent_2:Uh YAAAAAAA. my house loved rugrats. still do even though the little ones don't see how awesome it is.
17305	agent_2:That makes you think how small we are in the grand scheme of time.   agent_1:And in that time, we've managed to destroy 80 percent of the natural forests. So sad! agent_2:That is super sad, and that's not something that you can just fix very quickly as well. 	agent_1:I'm sure we'll always have a problem with trees. I know we are going to be helium free by the end of the 21st century so that is sad as well!
872	agent_1:For sure, I voted third party. I was part of the problem, I wanted a 3rd party to win because it has been years! agent_2:Well Bernie Sanders just announced his 2020 run, so if he actually makes it onto the ballot this year I will vote for him. agent_1:Yea, he got taken out of the running in 2016 by hillary. I am voting BIDEN!	agent_2:If Biden decided to run in 2020 i would probably choose him over Bernie, I always liked him when he was VP.
104497	agent_1:Yeah, pretty crazy. Bad move.  agent_2:Do you like baseball? agent_1:I do, I used to play when I was younger. 	agent_2:I'm a Yankee fan but I'll watch any game that has some top pitchers playing against each other. Do you root for a team?
18635	agent_2:I might have to look that up! The only one I have ever seen her in is the one with Kanye! agent_1:Yeah you could probably find it on google for sure! Google is my favorite search tool. They actually mow their lawns at their headquarters with goats! agent_2:Now thats enviormental! I look google too. Did you know they once went down for 5 minutes?	agent_1:Yeah man did that cause big problems! It took 40% of web traffic with it!
46118	"agent_1:I would definitely like to remove that from society. The German state of Schleswig-Holstein had the right idea. agent_2:Would it be better to follow culture, and perhaps include a ""hate"" button? Then BK and McD's could have hate button campaigns for junk food prizes. agent_1:I am sure that is not an advertising campaign they would want to use.However,  I am not sure why they thought it was a good idea to get people to unfriend people to promote the whopper."	agent_2:Anti-social behavior for caloric mayhem? Sounds good to me! LOL
87373	agent_2:I see, well hopefully he will become a famous pro driver, hopefully he wont get any crazy ideas and equip his car with a flamethrower agent_1:Like in South Africa. That is NUTS! I am so glad that I don't live there. I didn't realize that McDonalds added the drive thru to accommodate soldiers who were not allowed to get out of the car in their fatigues. I never knew there was such a thing. agent_2:I  know right, I would be so worried if that was a legal thing here in America, and really thats the story behind drive thrus? interesting	agent_1:It is. I know. I had no idea. Do you read poetry. It is really not my gig but interesting.
95947	agent_2:Garfield was one of my favorite cartoons as a kid! agent_1:Mine too, He's so funny... There is a state University in Michigan that has the largest comic book collection!! Who knew? agent_2:I didn't even know there were large public collections!	agent_1:Do you enjoy watching television?  Did you watch the 70's show?
75605	agent_1:Oh, interesting. An Iphone has more computing prowess than the US nuclear ICBM deterrent. agent_2:That's suprising. Well it was great chatting with you agent_1:Good chatting with you, also. Have a pleasant day.	agent_2:You too
148637	agent_1:I had heard that they had taught acting. Do you enjoy dramas as well? agent_2:I like classical drama, but I'm not as big a fan of the kind that's on TV in soap operas lately. It seems too cheesy and manufactured. agent_1:I'm not a soap opera fan either. Did you ever watch the TV show House?	agent_2:I've only seen a few episodes, but I know a lot about it because my mom binge-watched it a few years ago. Wish I'd seen more, because I enjoyed Hugh Laurie's acting very much.
139416	agent_1:yes I agree, and I wonder what the point of that was, also crazy that teddy roosevelt and John quinicy adams didn't use a bible during swearing in, I had no idea agent_2:Isn't that part of the tradition and essential part of being president? I wonder if that caused quite a stir. agent_1:ya, because I know if that happened today it would cause a stir, it must have caused an uproar back in the day, also before 1963 I guess it was very common for students to read the bible in school, that is definitely not the case now	agent_2:The bible is an interesting topic. Did you know the fruit in the bible only became an apple after it was translated into latin?
67424	agent_2:Then you may have donated lots of clean water! Telephone lines under the ocean, I wonder if that's the foundation for 5G service? agent_1:No idea, but i would love to talk to someone who did it! Very interesting. Did you know that an I phone has more computing power the the US nuclear ICBM deterrent? agent_2:That is a lot of computer power wonder if they use the same technology found in space shuttle's where the computer runs on 1mb of ram.	agent_1:that would be cool! I heard the Russians made a computer that runs on water too!
133236	agent_1:Do you watch Pokemon? agent_2:I used to love Pokemon its like 750 Pokemons now right? agent_1:Yeah. I think my son has seen them all. I know he has that many cards. I usually end up washing one or two a month then getting mad at him when I am cleaning out the basin.	agent_2:I think the show is really successful I like it a lot.
51843	agent_2:Do you think Piper had a Reddit account? If he did I bet all his posts got lots of up votes. agent_1:I hope so! I love dogs so much. And if I love them, as someone with allergies to them, everyone should. agent_2:I agree! I'm getting the urge to explore some of the many subbredits dedicated to dogs now.	agent_1:Nie chatting with you!
63147	agent_2:Right, i wonder which building it was. Apparently you can loose a lot of weight working in the warehouse. You'll walk about 7-15 miles a shift. agent_1:I know... I worked in a warehouse for 1.5 years and it was the worst. My feel and legs killed all the time. I was not made out for that.. agent_2:I hear you just walking from the car inside my work place is tiring so i can'e imagine.	agent_1:Although they make more than I did. And if they got stock options... I would suffer for that...
27299	"agent_2:Hi. Do you like rap music? agent_1: Yes, I do.Linkin park's ""hybrid theory"" is the best-selling album of the 21st century. agent_2:I didn't realize that. I also didn't know the person who created rap was Anthony ""DJ Hollywood"" Holloway."	agent_1:Really?  I didn't know that either.  Despite being released over 40 years ago, the dark side of the moon was still one of the best-selling albums of 2014.
109624	agent_1:Well the average in america consumer about 312 000 gallens a day agent_2:WOw that is too much, I had no idea about that agent_1:Yes and there is one in DUbai that uses 4 million gallons per day	agent_2:WOw that is a waste then. There is one in Australia where they have bull sharks in the hazard waters
17640	agent_2:I love dogs . THey have 12 blood types? agent_1:Yeah and there are blood drives for dogs agent_2:Yeah. DId you hear what they are doing in istanbul to feed the dogs?	agent_1:Yes. They have a machine where you put plastic bottles in and it dispenses food and water.
47749	agent_1:Bayer Crop Science and Ohio State University.   Apparently they are a hybrid and a GMO modified root crop.  So, that should make the ant-GMO-ers happy. agent_2:Most of our food has been modified in one way or another. Tearless onions don't sound that bad though. agent_1:Hybridization has been going on for centuries - GMO is relatively new.  What I find interesting is the compound that causes crying, syn-propanethial-S-oxide, is a defensive mechanism against being eating.  I never thought plants could evolve that way - its almost like they have a mind of their own!	agent_2:Hybrids are a modification of genes, just not done at the cellular level. I suppose there are risks, but people have not eaten food as it was in nature for centuries. I am not worried about GMO. Climate change? Yes.
68410	agent_1:Hi, how are you? agent_2:Hello there, I am well thank you.  Are you a fan of country music? agent_1:I will listen to it if it is on. I will seek it out once in a while. What are your feelings about it?	agent_2:I don't mind it, but I don't own any of it.  I do like classic country though if I had to choose between now and old.
34548	agent_2:I am unsure.  I know in Iceland they use it for suggestions about their constitution.  agent_1:That is awesome, power to the people! I am sure they hear crazy ideas though lol. It was so nice chatting with you! agent_2:It was great chatting with you as well.  	agent_1:Enjoy your day, unadd some friends for that whopper!
151168	agent_2:That makes sense engineers make a ton of money as well, I bet they design the tracking chips the NFL use agent_1:Yes, they make a lot of money. They probably do. I heard they track velocity, ball speed, rotation, and other things. agent_2:A lot of interesting data, amazing how tech is advancing and how the game is improving because of it.	agent_1:It was good talking to you!
104725	agent_2:Probably a button down collar shirt?  I am not sure,  kinda weird to wonder what kind of shirt someone would wear.  In the us senate,  there is a candy desk.  snack time! agent_1:I could go for a snack! Do you like dogs by the way? They are related to wolves agent_2:I love dogs.  do you have any?	agent_1:I used to have a husky. Dogs are so cuddly and come in all shapes and sizes haha. I love that their man's best friend do you have any dogs
20785	agent_1:I never saw anyone at a concert smash a guitar so I'm not sure how I'd feel about that either.  I do know that Pink Floyd's guitarist turned a Grand houseboat on the river Thames into a floating recording studio call the Astoria.  That must have been awesome. agent_2:Thats awesome, he must find a lot of peace out in the open sea agent_1:Probably.  Most anything done by Pink Floyd has to be amazing.  Do you golf?	agent_2:Not really, I find the sport boring, do you like it?
91665	"agent_2:Not really... I prefer football.  I do know that Tim Duncan stayed in college before playing.  agent_1:I'm the same way. I do watch it from time to time. I admire Tim Duncan for staying in college for four years instead of going directly to the NBA.  agent_2:Yeah.  NBA seems full of self aggrandizing thugs.  Oh well, physicists proved that shooting free throws ""granny style"" is more consistent. "	agent_1:Yeah apparently no player will do it because it looks stupid. I'd be trying to win games shooting like that and not worry about looking stupid.
59581	agent_2:what does it mean 8 minutes of white noise ? what kind of accident is that ? agent_1:No idea. She has her own way of doing things I guess. She will walk backwards to avoid having her photo taken. agent_2:Really ? Did You actually see her doing it ? ;)	agent_1:No. Speaking of overexposed pop stars, Justin Bieber has a video that's the most disliked on Youtube.
142663	"agent_2:I've heard that the democratic party of old was more like the republican party of now.  I think the GOP was liberal back in the day. agent_1:It was more ""liberal"" in some ways yeah. I'm a bit of a weirdo in that I'm a Mormon but a fairly liberal Democrat. agent_2:That is different considering the republican party supports traditional values based on judeo-christian ethics."	agent_1:The Democrats support traditional values too just in a different way than the Republicans. These parties are kind of defacto now though. There have only been Republicans or Democrats for a long time now.
142711	agent_1:Thats weird! The dutch are creating a commuter bus designed to travel at 160mph. agent_2:That would be pretty crazy to go that fast on the ground.  Now that's traveling! agent_1:This sounds expensive! All of japans highways are tolls, and it costs more than 300$ to travel across the country.	agent_2:Interesting fact, I bet their roads are all in very good condition.
87223	agent_1:Interesting. Did you know that humans can't synthesize vitamin c like most animals do. agent_2:That's interesting. I guess win some, lose some, right? At least  we know how to build fires and cook food, unlike any other living species. agent_1:guess thats what seperates us from the animals. Lol	agent_2:Well, we had hair covering our bodies until as recently as 240,000 years ago, so we aren't that far ahead in that respect haha.
28626	agent_2:I sometimes follow the government. What about you? agent_1:Same, I think they hide a lot of secrets so sometimes I just try to stay away from that. agent_2:Wikileaks does it best to stop that. They published the government's plans to destroy Wikileaks.	agent_1:That is kind of ironic, Wikileaks frustrated their own plans to destroy Wikileaks, funny, I think that the founder of Wikileaks is a real hero
110526	agent_1:That is crazy! That is such an innocent children's movie.  agent_2:I know, but I remember being scared. Did you know watching horror films can burn 180 calories? agent_1:I wonder why? I guess just the adrenaline rush. 	agent_2:Must be the reason. It was nice chatting with you!
78493	agent_2:I think it was Germany.  What's really interesting to me is that there have been 6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals identified.  Scientists believe that these may have arisen from a single common ancestor some 650 million years ago. agent_1:That is very interesting, wonder what that ancestor was or looked like?? agent_2:A blob of goo, most likely! Lol 	agent_1:Lol most likely yeah.  Do you know why animals have those white patches on their heads?
126620	agent_2:Well thanks for understanding. Its tough out here for female musicians as it has been for centuries. It was a time when women wasn't allowed to sing at all only men..  agent_1:Well, I have heard some of these men and they stink! They should stick to singing in the shower! agent_2:That is funny. Do you sing or do any kind of music at all ?	agent_1:I used to play trumpet but stopped... Too much time and I sucked at it. Nice chatting with you!
152527	agent_2:Yes it was a shame about his injury. They're saying he might not make it back to playing again. agent_1:Yes that was very sad to watch. Did you know that he entered college as a junior and was already working on his masters when drafted? agent_2:He seems like a very intelligent person. It's nice that he has some aspirations besides being an athlete.	agent_1:Yes I'm sure he will do just fine in life. Did you also know that Baker Mayfield considered quitting to pursue a career in professional video game playing?
64990	agent_2:I like him better doing comedy. agent_1:For sure, he is better at that. What do you think of our planet? agent_2:I think there is still a lot we can learn about the  Earth.	agent_1:I agree and other planets too! Did you hear about an earth like planet possibly like 455 light years away
58909	agent_1:Oh, yes I guess the tone is the same everywhere. That is a good idea. I think you'd have to have good ears though. agent_2:Yep I could see that. Do you know how to read by the way? Apparently Braille, which was invented by a fifteen-year-old, is used by the blind in order to read agent_1:Yes, I've never learned it. A French guy created it. Quite clever actually. Good for him!	agent_2:Yep he seems very smart, even Andrew Johnson, who never went to school, was able to learn how to read from his wife
12715	agent_2:I do love that some of those inventors give their wives credit for their assistance. They acknowlege they wouldn't have made those discoveries without them.  agent_1:Yeah and they should, like when they discovered the sun is actually white, not yellow because of atmospheric effect.  agent_2:Or that it produces enough energy to power everything for 500,000 years in one second. Talk about an advertisement for alternative energy. 	agent_1:Yeah good call.  Well it's been nice talking with you, I hope you have a good night!
39167	agent_2:I used to play right up through college.  Did you know that managers wear their uniforms because technically they are able to play if needed? agent_1:Really? I didn't know that. I read that a man found 3 million dollars worth of old baseball cards in his grand dads attic, how amazing! agent_2:Yes!  That's like winning the lottery.  Baseball is so popular in Japan that many fans there are surprised as its status as America's national pastime.	agent_1:Interesting! Fun facts here lol. So do you like dogs? I love dogs but don't have any pets right now.
326	agent_1:Yeah its like having a dog as a best friend. But able to shoot things agent_2:There was also a dog movie that opened this summer A.X.L. about a robot dog.  agent_1:I will have to check that one out as well. Thanks for your time. have a good day	agent_2:Do you like dogs ? I love them, they were one of the first domesticated animals.
92386	agent_1:How funny is this... Stephen King said the scariest movie he ever saw was Bambi!! agent_2:I watched Bambi when I was a child and I remember it being pretty scary! Apparently you can burn calories when watching scary movies though. agent_1:Maybe that will be my workout regimen for 2019!	agent_2:Funny! I guess we just can't eat too much buttery popcorn while watching.
119628	agent_1:Do you watch a lot of TV?  agent_2:I do enjoy watching TV what about yourself?  agent_1:I do. I love Seinfeld! Did you know he has a net worth of more than Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise combined? 	agent_2:I did not know that but it sure is an interesting fact, there is an actor that earns 700,000 an episode, guess it pays to be a great actor
46536	agent_2:Yes her, she is so funny in the Office  agent_1:Yeah, she is pretty funny. Did you know Shakespeare invented the names miranda, Jessica, and Olivia.  agent_2:that is so cool. that guy has contributed to much the english literature with his work	agent_1:yeah, his works can also take on different meanings.
55133	agent_1:True very true Im sure theres gotta be some reason agent_2:Did you know there is a frequency that causes fear in humans, I wonder if they use it in horror films? agent_1:No I did not know that I would hope not. Wow. Can you imagine?	agent_2:I would bet that the movies that really scare us have the frequency.
128046	agent_1:I guess it's a movie agent_2:Yes, I watched it before, numerous times. I once worked at a Playcare and the children used to request it all the time. agent_1:oh I worked at a juvenile facility. They would watch anything out of boredom but I never heard of Wreck it Ralph	agent_2:Do you remember the game called Pac Man?
99963	agent_1:Oh that's interesting. Also interesting that he doesn't put his music on iTunes in terms of tracks. he only does full albums agent_2:He has some artistic integrity I guess. He teamed up with Alicia Keys to do a song about NYC called Empire State of Mind. agent_1:I actually like that song. I thought it was better than the Katy Perry and Snoop Dogg song California Girls, those two songs were meant to go head-to-head apparently	agent_2:Yeah I never dug Snoop's whole schtick. I've been listening to Jay-Z since Reasonable Doubt.
56776	agent_2:Haha you need to create a store that sells dog fart balloons LOL I guarantee you someone would buy them haha. What do you think about the un Ambassador that they have ambassador to extraterrestrials must have a really lonely job lol agent_1:Yeah, and training for an impending invasion is difficult. Like how many times can one person watch the movie, Mars Attacks?  And if Earth is the densest planet in our solar system, why would any sensible alien want to stop off and speak to dense earthlings anyway? agent_2:Haha I agree with you. Nice job bringing up Mars Attacks too, that's a movie I haven't thought about in a long time haha. That is almost a horror movie, I will be able to burn the 180 calories if I watch that again. Have you ever seen the movie The Shining by the way	agent_1:Yes. A nice film you can watch with the whole family. You just can't let them know that it is a horror film until they grow up... like they did with the actor that played the role of little Danny!
149350	agent_2:That was interesting - I did not know that.  The president and congress can declare someone an honorary citizen.   agent_1:Yes, that is correct, they both can.  Did you know that the planet Jupiter has radio storms that are so strong, AM radio can pick them up and we can hear them? I wouldn't know would they would actually sound like though. agent_2:I wonder what they sound like.  Radio waves can carry various information.	agent_1:Canada requires all radio station to play at least 40% of the music by Canadian artists.
103150	agent_2:I love that he made dc united the hottest team already. agent_1:I knew he plays for them but had no idea he's made that much of an impact - worst to first?!?!?  We don't have an MLS team here so I am not that into MLS, but I do follow the Premier League  agent_2:I have not been following much the last couple years but I am more into the Italian league.	agent_1:Interesting - I know the interest in the US ticks up after the World Cup, even without the US qualifying this turn.  Pretty disappointing....
109956	agent_2:A cat named hank placed third in the virginia senate election. Hank should have won. agent_1:haha I would have voted for him, sad that american voter participation has topped out at 63% though agent_2:And 5 presidents were elected while still losing the popular vote.	agent_1:yup screwy, do you think the dems should run a basketball player in 2020? I guess the taller candidate would win 75% of the time
96158	agent_2:That's funny, I know Harry Conick Jr. but never listened to his music.  I've listened to countless John Mayor songs, has a great sound.  Ever been to any of those 2 concerts? agent_1:I have not been to a concert for either but would love to be able to go one day. Do you have a favorit genre of music? agent_2:I am mostly a hip-hop, r&b, and soul kind of guy but I mix in a bunch of everything.  My favorite at the moment is listening to the soul of Sam Cooke and Stevie Wonder, love their sound and music.  	agent_1:I totally agree I too love soul music, it just has a way of calming my thoughts as well as makes one think about the tone as well as the words.
1021	agent_2:Yes, I did.  It was the movie when I was a kid! agent_1:Seems like Steven Spielberg is trying to return to his glory with Ready Player One. Have you seen that? agent_2:No, I haven't see it.  Have you?	agent_1:I have't either. At the premiere screening the sound cut out. But instead of booing, the audience member cheers and makes their own sound effects.
100179	"agent_2:No I don't watch any new networks but I read about them. Looks like Fox wants to make programming for their ""superfans"" agent_1:I read that too! I wonder if it will be popular? I would think with their sexual harassment scandal Fox would tone it down a bit. agent_2:I don't think their fanbase really cares or believes the sexual harrassment scandal, I mean Fox news is still in first place in the ratings despite it"	agent_1:True. And hannity and Chris Wallace are superstars for Fox. I heard Fox once wanted a channel dedicated to the Simpsons.
72733	agent_2:Right, how did they get the idea and what did they hear from them is my question agent_1:Yes, I agree. Need to find that out!!  Getting ready soon for the launch, thinking Fox News will show it live as well as Nasa on my phone. Fox News is watched more than CNN and MSNBC combined! agent_2:that is crazy! I think fox news was created by the republicans if i remember right	agent_1:Yeah, Richard Nixon was one of the creators.  Fox News considered creating a cable channel that only aired The Simpsons!
120588	agent_1:I don't really know.  But I thought it was strange that the citizens of Austin Tx voted to rename their garbage dump after Fred Durst. agent_2:I would have voted for that. Can you think of any reasons why they can't vote in Alabama? agent_1:No, I don't follow a lot of news hype.  I thought it was funny, though, that the first president of Zimbabwe was called President Banana.	agent_2:For sure, thought that was pretty funny too, apparently it was his name and not a nickname like I first thought ha. I'm really surprised the guest house of the white house is bigger than the actual thing.
16297	agent_1:Do you like to watch movies? agent_2:I do like to watch movies.  They are generally well crafted escapist entertainment. I might be a super hero as well. agent_1:I love hero movies, do you have a favorite hero, mine is Spiderman or Peter Parker	agent_2:Can I say that Robbie the robot from the original lost in space is my hero.  Always around and in the way. Danger Will robinson, Danger.
14438	agent_1:Wow. DO you know how to keep your shoes fresh? agent_2:Yes you can use tea bags and put them in the shoes agent_1:Yeah. Do you know how Steve Smith is raising awareness for homelessness?	agent_2:Yes he leaves his cleats in the field after the games
72889	agent_1:I havent heard about that one before he must be a great artist, so Spotify is available in 78 regions! thats a lot of place.  agent_2:That is!  I like how the content is protected, really helps prevent theft. agent_1:I guess it does, it can be hard to download music from there I like the premium service I think the price is right	agent_2:What is it?  I havent even checked that much out.
54003	agent_2:I agree. We need to suppport them more. agent_1:I understand guilty until proven innocent. But instead of making someone fear for their safety, there should be more support groups.  agent_2:I agree. I think we need to work towards those ends. They need more.	agent_1:The metoo movement is a great start, and politicians putting it down instead of assisting it is disgusting.
128346	agent_2:Yes, LOL! i think that maybe violence on TV desensitizes us to violence. i think that FOX news turned out parents into the people that they thought video games would turn us into. agent_1:I agree with that.  We are so used to seeing it that we dont think anything of it anymore. agent_2:it is dangerous to think the media doesnt have an effect, but usually people imagine the wrong effect.	agent_1:Reality has a much more powerful effect than any of the made up things.  It is reality that hurts us more.
135111	agent_1:Hi there, do you watch tv? agent_2:Hey there I watch television from time to time. I mostly \watch Netflix though, what about you? agent_1:Coll. Yes me too, I like watching TV. Did you ever see the Simpsons?	agent_2:Yes I love The Simpsons. I only like the earlier episodes though, I don't really like these later ones. Apparently they made an episode where Bart does not appear and he's not mentioned. It's probably boring because he's my favorite character haha
109013	agent_2:So it looked like the Patriots grip was slipping and the Jaguars appeared to be prying them away. But the Patriots still made it to the Super Bowl. agent_1:yup thats what happened, did you hear about the chips the nfl uses on teh field? agent_2:Yeah, Americans sure do take their football seriously. They use the chips in the shoulder pads and balls.	agent_1:ya, I just don't want them putting those chips on people outside the game that would be scary
158872	agent_1:She was Trump's assistant. The gatekeeper. Apparently he tried to get her to lie and now that might bring him down agent_2:Ahhh... okay, didn't know that.  Just Googled her and yes, she is rather attractive!  :) agent_1:Yeah..the rest of the WH staff have the potential to be on the radio	agent_2:Speaking of the white house, did you know they still use floopy disks in part for storing files?  I've read that the paperwork to get a new computer for a staff member takes forever to go through, so that's why so many things are so outdated... but still, floppy disks?  Wonder if it's 3 1/2 or 5 1/4 (or maybe both!)
100787	agent_1:I think it was both. agent_2:Can you imagine trump singing pop? agent_1:I wonder if any president ever recorded music before	agent_2:Well apparently the president of Indonesia has released 3 pop albums. He must be really good.
58376	agent_1:I know. And when I get bored, I eat. What a waste! Can you imagine what you would have done with that money at 19?!?!?!? agent_2:Probably spend it on something stupid lol, that kid must be really smart though, he trained a computer to rap, that must require mad skills agent_1:i know. Most kids that age use it for inappropriate viewing. And they thought it would go for $10,000....	agent_2:Yeah, but it seems like the kid is mature as he is working for the Standford University Lab, many wouldnt do that and just take sabatical
94993	agent_1:Interesting. Where does that occur?  agent_2:Well, the British and my wife say it that way.  Originally TV was broadcast in black and white.  That must have been awful, but better than no TV at all. agent_1:Interesting. Did you know 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes? 	agent_2:I have never seen shoes perform!  I would like to see the video that proves that.  Television is considered a mass medium, but narrow casting is occurring more often now with so many channels.
145284	agent_1:I don't know. It was back in 1975 so maybe it was some rule they had back then.  Times have certainly changed though.  I mean, it's now legal to have flame throwers on your car in south africa. agent_2:That is crazy.  A flame thrower in a vehicle powered by gasoline.  I mean nothing can go wrong there. agent_1:I know, right?! Somehow they think that having them will prevent their car from being stolen.  I'm not sure how though.	agent_2:I hope they don't have many road rage incidents in South Africa.  Did you know Jann Mardenborough became a race driver because he beat 90,000 people in a video game called gran turismo?
158838	agent_2:Somehow I doubt they thought to use a pencil and a razor blade to make a radio like the WWII soldiers did.  agent_1:It is amazing how far we have come, with classic radio dramas now free on the Internet. agent_2:Yes, I love that. I've heard there are 100's of episodes for free.	agent_1:That is true, but none of them are in Classical Latin!
108089	agent_1:I am not sure but I do know running as a third party is really tough. Many of them are sacrificial lambs hoping to reach the minimum 20% to be a valid party for the next election. Politics is weird.... like every us president with a beard has been a republican. agent_2:I know and they take things so seriously.  I mean Truman went to Disneyland and wouldn't be photographed on the dumbo ride so no one could associate him with the republicans. agent_1:HAHAHA. Maybe he was just self-conscious about his weight. 	agent_2:Maybe so.  Seems like everything is about money nowadays though.  People change parties and parties change idealogies all over economic stances.
112948	agent_2:That's not surprising. It's a right in Finland to have access to the internet agent_1:As it probably should be too. Sometimes I wonder if we'd be better without it. The library of Alexandria has a copy of the entire Internet. agent_2:With how addicted people are to it, it's hard to say. It has its uses too. I remember back when I used to spend a lot of time on Neopets. Apparently it was very popular in 2001 since it was the fourth most trafficked website	agent_1:On another note, are you interest in radio as well?
47484	agent_1:Yeah! Apparently soccer makes more money than football, basketball, baseball, golf, tennis and hockey combined! That must be worldwide, since here we really don't see much soccer. agent_2:Right, must be. Jon Stewart was a good soccer player in college. He represented the US at the Pa American Maccabi games in Brazil. agent_1:When I played soccer with my friends as a kid, I felt that it was pretty easy. I know sometimes it can get hard what with all of the ball stealing and having to get past a goalie, but it was easy enough for me to enjoy. My friends were so good though! Doing all of that fancy footwork. It was a fun experience! I can see why Jon Stewart played soccer. But I had no idea that he did!	agent_2:Right, it feels like in the US that more people play soccer as kids than watch the professional sport.
29554	agent_1:Do you enjoy listening to music albums? agent_2:I do music is an excellent art form. agent_1:I enjoy how music albums contain collections of the best audio recording such as Linkin's hybrid theory or dark side of the moon	agent_2:Those are both excellent albums. I also find it interesting how some artists like tupac went to school to study ballet, acting, poetry, and jazz at a baltimore school.
23219	agent_1:I bet he was an excellent dancer, he could move around effortlessly it seemed.  And I agree, all types of athletics.  agent_2:Take Tom Brady, Patriots long-time QB for example. Sometimes when he makes an accurate throw, his movement syncs with the ball, which flies magically right to a receiver, and the receiver's leap is just like a dance movement.  agent_1:That is an excellent example!  Did you know that ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of shoes in a single week!?	agent_2:Heard that, and I believe it. Think that refers to classical ballet dancers, not necessarily modern dance. Alvin Ailey pioneered modern dance, and he understood that audiences want to see more athleticism, like they'd see on a field, court or in a stadium.
66931	agent_2:That sounds rough. I'd definitely rather be poor and set my own schedule. agent_1:Exactly, and while it does pay well annually, if you divide up the hours it is similar to working in a fast food place.  agent_2:I definitely see why you got out of that. Hope you're doing something you prefer now.	agent_1:I took a job in a similar field where I didn't have to live in NYC and work 100+ hours. Much chiller. Well, nice chatting with you!
102993	agent_2:I used one a long time ago. my grandma had one, you? agent_1:I have. Did you know that 212 is the fastest number to dial?  agent_2:I didn't know that, isn't that New Yorks area code?	agent_1:Yeah, it is. Did you know that an iPhone has more computing power than the entire US Nuclear ICBM deterrent.
145218	agent_1:I agree with you.  I just read that dogs have 12 different blood types. agent_2:Wow, that sounds like it would make things a lot more complicated than humans with four blood types! I wonder if they can donate. agent_1:They can.  They donate blood at dog blood drives.	agent_2:That's amazing. I've never seen one, but I can only imagine a waiting room full of fluff balls waiting to donate for their fellow dogs.
19975	agent_1:Me too, I think i have seen that. It would be interesting with sounds while there because mars has a higher frequency agent_2:Sounds like that might drive me crazy, haha. I would have to read some soothing poetry to calm me down. agent_1:For sure, I like reading in general, poetry is nice	agent_2:Poetry has been around for a long time, since prehistoric times with hunting poetry in Africa.
39727	agent_2:Yes it is more comfortable for them when they play agent_1:Yeah. Do you know when the cool jazz genre came about? agent_2:Yes that was in the 1940a, it is calmer and smoother than regular jazz	agent_1:Yeah. THere is a programming language where the programs have jaz-like harmonies
116318	agent_1:That's so funny, they could be making laws to benefit society but they're doing this. I'm sure Big Foot and Nessy are happy though! Lol. agent_2: Did you know Germany was the first country to give animals constitutional rights, now thats crazy! We will be soon giving mythicalcreatures rights also. agent_1:That is pretty cool, Germany was ahead of their times. Do you ever go to Reddit?	agent_2:Yep, I am guilty. I tend to vote more on there. I like seeing everyones opinions.
142394	agent_1:Yes!  I listen to talk radio, sports during my work day - I like to have it on in the background and I especially like baseball talk and games - can't wait! agent_2:Thats great, I listen to it on my way to work, I like to listen to drama episodes and theres a free website where you can access thousands of episodes. agent_1:Like Podcasts?  I've heard some crime episodes and I do find them fascinating 	agent_2:Yeah kind of like podcasts, I think its great how the Canadian government supports its own artists, 40% of the music in Canadian radios has to be from Canadian artists.
127709	agent_2:I think it's well deserving it totally changed the way football is watched. The highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when Georgia Tech defeated cumber land  222 to 0. agent_1:That's alot of scoring! I wonder if anyone's ever tried to beat University of Iowa that bad after being in their pink locker room? agent_2:You bring up a good point because I feel like that would backfire on the University of Iowa because it would make them want to play even harder. I wonder if the United States Senate has a lot of football fans? The Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress.	agent_1:I like the candy desk. I'd be visiting it often.
139861	agent_2:Yeah I did that when I was younger. I haven't played basketball in a really long time no. Apparently scientists say that that is the most consistent way to shoot. I just think could be so funny to see all these guys making millions of dollars and shooting granny style LOL agent_1:It sure would have helped Shaq, he couldn't shoot a free throw to save his life.  agent_2:Haha Shaq definitely should have tried that, didn't he only score like one free throw in his entire career? I think Michael Jordan had a better record, with his Air Jordan shoes haha	agent_1:Yeah, I heard they were banned when they were first introduced, is that true?
93953	agent_2:Yeah, True. Are you a fan of Linkin Park?  agent_1:I actually am their album hybrid theory is the best one of the 21 century agent_2:Nice, they were a good band. Too bad about the singer. 	agent_1:Yeah that was really unfortunate. did you hear about those 100 year old twins in japan that released an album?
127634	agent_2:Football is a great sport, and it has come a long way! You know, in the 1960s, the top pro bowlers made twice what the best football player made? How things have changed! agent_1:They did? that is amazing, football players earn so much money these days that is hard to imagine agent_2:Yeah. It is also hard to imagine watching a football game on TV without that superimposed yellow line on the screen. ESPN won an Emmy for figuring that one out. A big step from just an making real an imaginary line!	agent_1:I think its a deserved Emmy, ESPN changed the game and it might seems like a small contribution but the game wouldnt be the same without it
137598	agent_1:I do, there is an interesting frequency that picks some of the radio storms of the planet Jupiter agent_2:I'll have to try that out on my way to work tomorrow! I guess you can pick it up on AM radio! agent_1:Yeah its only available in AM radio I think, you  know soldiers back in WWII knew how to make radios out of razorblades and pecils!! 	agent_2:I want to know how to do taht! Have you ever listened to classic radio dramas? Are they any good?
67008	agent_2:Look at us now, yes you are right. There is also all this Net Neutrality debate.  We' are at the point where internet is the same as gas, electric and water.  agent_1:Things will probably change for the better but it will probably take a while, especially with the government wasting time doing things like trying to destroy Wikileaks. Even if you disagree with them, it's not like they can just come in and shut them down. agent_2:The Government could shut them down but another service would appear, or they just reappear themselves in a different form.  the government should focus on not shutting down itself every now and then.	agent_1:That's a good point! Once wikileaks published the report it just made them look even more stupid.
3979	agent_2:If only that money was put to better use. agent_1:It is a bit like the scientist Hertz that worked out electromagnetism. Macaroni, did very little of the science but he was credited with inventing radio!  agent_2:I think the pointless project funding goes back to entitlement spending. People start to think they can spend just because they want to. 	agent_1:I think that was on the tails of the industrial revolution. I think that know with spending out of control only endowed universities have the luxury of funding research without a product goal.
140967	agent_1:Speaking of the military, did you know McDonalds invented the drive thru for people in the military back in the day agent_2:I didn't know that.  Why did they invent the drive thrus for the military? agent_1:Back in the day if you were in uniform, you couldn't leave you car with it on. So hence the drive thru allowed them to get food 	agent_2:Who would have thought that?  Do you know that the Cadillac was named after the French explorer who was also the founder of Detroit - Antoine de la mothe Cadillac?
79745	agent_1:ya dogs are awesome, I don't understand cat people. dogs actually love you while cats just tolerate you haha agent_2:My wife is a cat person. I have two cats and one pees all over the place. I wanna get rid of it but it's my sons cat and he will loose it if we get rid of it! agent_1:ya that is a tough spot! does your son like disney movies?	agent_2:He does. What is your favorite movie?
58795	agent_1:It truly is. Vanilla Ice once lost a goat and a Wallaroo in 2004. Can you imagine the police report? agent_2:I'm wondering how he managed to lose both? Ha! If we were like Germany, those animals would have constitutional rights. They were the first country to do that as a matter of fact! agent_1:That is weird. We have hiccups because we used to have both gills and lungs. Must be why babies get hiccups inutero.	agent_2:Maybe so! That makes sense, though! I mean, with a few exceptions, most animals, including humans breathe oxygen, move, grow from a hollow sphere of cells, reproduce sexually, etc. anyway, so the hiccup origins should come as no surprise.
4382	agent_2:Haha no, king snakes can not do that, if they could I am not sure I would want to own one, they sound very dangerous. agent_1:Where I live a giant cobra escaped and was loose in the city. agent_2:Well I hope someone caught it before someone killed it, You cant punish them for doing what is hard wired into them.	agent_1:They never found it.  Dead or alive.  Yeah, I have a friend who is seriously afraid of snakes, runs away from the smallest ones.
141271	agent_1:I understand the feeling but we shouldn't be. There has been so many unfortunate shootings but what has come about it and changed to prevent it? agent_2:Well I think with the advent of social media and growing population, news hit the circuit pretty quickly, and people are just getting peer pressured into wanting to rage it out on society. agent_1:I personally think that the news should try to be unbiased. Perhaps I'm naive but I really dislike bias news, fake news, and paparazzi	agent_2:No one wants to really hear dry news. That's what NPR is for. Any no one really listen to NPR news except for podcasts... Even so, they select which news they think is worthy enough.
161066	agent_2:Yes I agree. I like the touchdown dance some players do. Not the most aesthetic but it works! agent_1:Bruce Lee was a great dancer.  won championship in 58 agent_2:Oh yes that is interesting. Although I have never heard of the dance variation hong kong cha-cha!	agent_1:Ballet Dancers go through 4 pairs in a week!
125234	agent_1:Do you like South Park or the Simpsons? agent_2:I like both. Did you know that there is only one episode of The Simpsons ever where Bart does not appear and is not mentioned? agent_1:That is very interesting.  There are also over 750 episodes of Pokemon.	agent_2:Wow! I had no idea it had been on long enough to have that many episodes.
3689	agent_1:The earliest western poetry was written in Sumerian.  agent_2:Was it as complex then as today? Using rhyme, rhetoric, and other literary devices? agent_1:One was called the Epic of Sundiata an example of griot court poetry. This was in Africa. 	agent_2:Writing poetry is definitely an art. For instance, there is poem that when read normally is depressing, yet backwards it is inspiring. Perhaps embodying the silver lining to a negative situation.
134440	agent_1:Very true. DO you know much about Wikileaks? agent_2:I only know what was widely reported in the news. I never visited the site or any documents they released. How about you? agent_1:I know they became very popular for disclosing government secreat and then even published documents that showed how the government was trying to destroy them	agent_2:Their founder also fled the country to avoid prosecution but I believe he was eventually extradited.
20638	agent_2:Heck no, what would you do with one?  I mean, it what are you trying to be Al Pacino in Scarface? lol agent_1:HAHA. Roosevelt had over 20 pets, including a bear and a hyena. agent_2:That is just too nuts, both of those animals and I'm sure a bunch of the other ones just doesn't make sense to me. 	agent_1:I agree. It was good talking to you!
123192	agent_1:Where is the coolest place you've been? I do. I don't know if I would want to travel the whole way across Japan though. agent_2:The coolest place has to be Argentina I really loved that country and also Ecuador, what about you? and Japan seems like a great destination.  agent_1:Awesome! I would say Italy. I do want to travel to South Africa and see those flamethowers people put on cars!	agent_2:We would be in so much trouble if the same rule applied in America lol, did you hear about people stealing garden gnomes before travelling.
78524	agent_1:My kids are in 5th grade and they can tell time on a standard clock.  And I switched all of our digital clocks to military time so they have to do math! agent_2:That was smart.  Kids should know both digital and analog clocks. agent_1:With everyone having smart phones these days, there is little need for them to know how to tell time on a clock - but I agree with you - they should!  It's very important	agent_2:What do you think about computers being used in the classrooms?
31	agent_1:True Did you know Jackson had a patent on a dancing device? agent_2:Yes it helped him smooth out his dance moves agent_1:Nice. Do you like Shakespeare?	agent_2:Yes I do. Do you know that he popularized many phrases
117671	agent_1:Yes, seems her generation had more of that than the current generation of stars. She was close to the community and her family so I think it kept her and her generation more grounded.  agent_2:Right. We could use more like Aretha today agent_1: I agree with your sentiment.	agent_2:Ariana Grande got caught licking doughnuts at a doughnut shop. I used to see her on Nickelodeon, she has a kid's show on there.
156057	agent_1:Soccer almost never stops. Also don't take my advice on QBs as cannon. I watched Alex Smith in college and said he'd be an all time great. Turns out he's just a genius who is an average QB. agent_2:I never knew that he was that smart, but I think you have to have a lot of intelligence to be a QB in the NFL. With the playbooks and reading defenses, it is intense.  agent_1:He took so many AP classes in college that he came into Utah as a Junior.	agent_2:That is impressive and he got his bachelor's in only two years. He should be a coach someday.
134803	agent_2:Good morning. I like dramas especially when they are combined with music like opera. agent_1:Did you know Hugh Laurie is the highest paid actor for a TV drama? agent_2:For his working on House MD? He deserves it! $700,000 per episode must be nice. 	agent_1:That's a ton of money! Did you know Jim Carrey doesn't make dramas anymore?
19671	"agent_2:It would.  But then again, it seems you would have to stick to a fairly non-controversial cause like hunger. agent_1:LOL. ""I'm against bad things in the world!"" ""Which ones?"" ""The ones that everyone hates so that they'll like me for opposing them!"" agent_2:Yep, exactly.  If you're edgy as an artist, you should be allowed to be edgy as a philanthropist."	agent_1:Money and fame should give you the chance to challenge the status quo.
111592	agent_1:That's very strange. Why don't they just leave it blank like everywhere else I wonder? I do think it's funny that In Austin the people voted to rename their garbage dump Fred Durst.  agent_2:It is very strange for sure. Really, haha why in the world would they vote for that..... agent_1:I have no idea. Presidential elections are obviously important. Did you know that the first president of Zimbabwe was called president banana?	agent_2:Definitely important, especially in the times we are living in now. Wow, that's kinda funny I wonder why Banana? I read that since 1900 the taller candidate has won the presidential election about 75% of the time lol think that's funny.
81405	agent_1:hey there, do you know much about the sun? agent_2:Hi! I do know a bit! For one, I know that it's mass is comprised of approximately 73% hydrogen and the rest is mostly helium. Are you interested in the topic? agent_1:Yes very much so. Did you know it is actually white and not yellow?	agent_2:I heard that...something about atmospheric scattering that gives off that impression. It's amazing how something we see (almost) every day can still be so unknown to us. I just learned recently that the sun is only 1 billionth the size of the largest star ever discovered in the galaxy, and I always thought it was one of the larger components in space!
144113	agent_1:I would think it would make the most sense that athletic teams have to give back a certain percentage of their funding to university as a whole. After that, It would make sense for them to utilize their funds in a way that makes sense. If a school needs a new library or buildings I think that responsibility should fall more on the university as a whole, and not specifically the athletics team.  agent_2:Yeah I agree with that statement. I think it reflects the values of our society: people wanna watch exciting football games and they want the best possible facilities and equipment whereas the more important aspects like education often get neglected. Do you think free college for everyone is a good idea? agent_1:Agreed! I definitely think free education for everyone is a good idea. However, my fear would be that the value of a college degree would decrease if everyone had access to go. I don't think college was set up to allow for everyone to attend. 	agent_2:Interesting. Ideally I would love for everyone to get a college education, I think it would greatly benefit our society. However, I don't think that college is the right path for everyone and we have to put more emphasis on technical schools to teach people useful skills. Some people graduate college with a useless degree.
39924	agent_2:Wow! Didn't know that. It makes sense listening to his music. He basically rapped poetry. agent_1:True. Ballet is intense. Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week. agent_2:Makes sense. Those shoes are quite flimsy.	agent_1:I think it's cute that babies spontaneously dance when they hear music!
111212	agent_2:Yes.  I used to love watching House! agent_1:Drama is the specific mode of performance to represented in a play, ballet etc... they are especially performed in theatre or an radio. agent_2:Did you ever watch House starring Hugh Laurie?  He earned $700,000 per episode making him the highest paid actor ever for a tv drama.	"agent_1:Yes. I watched only some episode. I have no time to watch it. The drama comes from the Greek word ""action'. The drama represent the traditional division between comedy and tragedy."
76264	agent_1:Yeah one or the other. The coaches are still the highest paid state employees though agent_2:I guess the dollars from TV, advertisers and alumni drive up the salaries. It's a shame that sports dominates college. agent_1:Yeah I agree with that for sure. Have you heard of the highest court in the land?	agent_2:The highest court in the US is the Supreme Court. It is not a basketball court but a court of law. It is not for the NBA.
27639	agent_2:I am afraid to fly but it is the fastest! agent_1:Yeah. Maybe you should try the Dutch bus that travels at 160mph. agent_2:Unless it turns into Speed! That would be scary...	agent_1:True. Unfortunately in japan all highways are tolls! Expensive for sure...
111170	agent_1:I bet Trump is very pleased at those arrangements. He could probably rent out the guest house. Put a TRUMP sign on it. LOL agent_2:Haha I could see that happening. Fox news would likely cover that story! Fox News once thought about creating a channel airing only The Simpsons! agent_1:That would be overkill. no need for a whole channel. they could just set up a website. 	agent_2:Exactly. You should work for Fox News lol. The Fox News Network was created by Richard Ailes, a republican media strategist.
131447	agent_1:I think they feel differently about other politicians than they say on campaign.  agent_2:Theres one thing im sure of, Trump and Clinton would have disagreed too much. Did you know Trumps guest house is bigger than the White House? agent_1:Would have been fun to watch!	agent_2:It would have been fun indeed! maybe Clinton would have won if the %34 of men baned from voting in Alabama were allowed to vote back when the elections took place.
74057	agent_1:Yeah that would be awesome. I wonder how fast the internet on Mt. Everest is? agent_2:I think they have 3g service. It will be enough to load a picture or two on instagram when you reach the peak lol agent_1:Which is what counts!! In case the internet burns down there is a saved copy at the current library of alexandria. Not sure how that works!	agent_2:I don't either. I hope they have a back up to the back up, just in case! It was so nice chatting with you!
67701	agent_2:No but I heard that google's cars have an aggressive mode.  agent_1:No way! I bet that is for big city driving haha. They ought to put flame throwers on them too! agent_2:That is crazy. Did you know it is illegal to warm up your car in ohio?	agent_1:I didn't know that! I wonder why? Do you know?
37313	"agent_2:That's a creative profession! He would have done well at that too, I suppose. agent_1:I think so and his favorite character was Spiderman. Have you heard of Compliment Battle? agent_2:No, I haven't. That's a strange ""battle."""	agent_1:Yeah I think so too, just complimenting each other. Did you hear of that judge who delivered the ruling in the form of rap?
31012	"agent_2:The distances are so great that we will need ""warp speed"" to explore very many planets.  Think of one where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph and at 2000 degrees! agent_1:Yeah, the possibility of finding another inhabitable planet seems slim. We really should try to make do with this one. agent_2:I agree.  However, I have read that warp speed is theoretically possible.  Who knows?  If mankind last long enough.   I just saw that a new tiny galaxy was located this week."	agent_1:I wonder whether we'll get discovered first. That would be wild. Anyhow, thanks for the chat! Have a good night!
52226	agent_2:it's like being the movie studio that denies a role to ronald reagan because he doesn't look presidential agent_1:Did you know tom hanks refuses to play bad guy parts? agent_2:yeah...i guess he wants to keep a good guy image. maybe he should do bill nye the science guy	agent_1:why?
61307	agent_2:Good point.  Google is so big, I understand they have 16 lane highways to their headquarters. agent_1:WHAT? that is a crazy amount, I wonder what traffic looks like, probably better than around here agent_2:I do not know.  But that place is tighter than fort knox, that is why I use Drice cloud.	agent_1:I bet it is. A single google search requires more computing power than it took to send the astronauts to the moon!
17266	agent_2:yes, i guess he could kick back, but the world is in trouble and we need his help. Superheroes have no choice. they must help agent_1:True.  Are you a fan of the Marvel comics/movies?   agent_2:i like marvel. i guess spiderman is my favorite.	agent_1:Nice,  I really like Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor.
156156	agent_2:That's awesome, congrats on the big win! I find it hilarious what people will create a fantasy league for. There is actually a fantasy draft for the National Spelling Bee!  agent_1:HAHA! I would lose that fantasy team. Unless I could use my google dictionary at all times! lol. I have heard about fantasy congress leagues, that's funny! agent_2:I heard about that one too! Can you imagine drafting members of congress and hoping for their legislative success. I feel like it would take a loooooooong time before there was any winner declared for that one! 	"agent_1:Yeah, forever They will prob have a ""shutdown"" immediately. That is why I stick with football."
121466	agent_2:Mostly kids are liked to match pokemon. I also like it. agent_1:There are so many episodes too. That makes it fun because you don't have to watch the same season over and over again. The characters really develop over those 750 episodes.  agent_2:Netflix company expanded internationally in 2010 with streaming available in Canada. Netflix entered the content-production industry in 2012.	agent_1:Very cool. Well it has been nice chatting with you have a good day.
156387	agent_1:and it still seems to be. do you listen tot he radio much? agent_2:I often listen to a website that has thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas and its all for free. I appreciate the fact that the website offers it for free. agent_1:yeah me too that is really nice. you can also catch Jupiter's storms on the radio	agent_2:I have enjoyed that recently. I wish I could understand the latin channel. Since 1989 a finnish radio station has broadcast 'nuntii latini'
45822	agent_2:Blazing Saddles is a really funny satire that would never be made today agent_1:I see.  I will research further later.  The Oscars were nominated for 9 emmys in 2013.  Did they ever win any? agent_2:Hmm I don't know. I do know James Wong Howe won an oscar in cinematography	agent_1:That was good.  I heard of him.  On another topic, do you use your cell phone a lot?
163308	agent_2:True.  All I know is it's not for me.   agent_1:Yes I hear you on that. agent_2:Give me a nintendo though and I'm set.   To bad they discontinued them in September of 2003	agent_1:Yes to bad. It could only display 54 colors. But it was a big hit.
46839	agent_1:Huh, not orange? agent_2:Yeah our atmosphere changes it agent_1:I think our sun is relatively small in the grand scheme of the universe.	agent_2:A lot of things are. It is only 1 billionth the size of the largest star in our own galaxy
158885	"agent_2:I remember years I bought a set of cassette tapes (dunno if you remember those) at a store of ""X Minus One"" an old sci-fi radio show from like the 50s.  It was pretty neat listening to them, really lets you imagination take over.  Now you can download a lot of those old shows online... agent_1:Wow. Everything for free on the internet. I feel as rich as JFK, G.Washington, and T.Jefferson....the 3 richest Potus' of all time. agent_2:Yeah, from what I understand, Washington has a lot of land holdings and stuff. I read an article recently about how much various presidents are worth before and after they became President, fascinating stuff..."	agent_1:I would think that the poor (clinton) got richer but the rich (Bush) got poorer. Could be wrong. After all, I never thought a potus would ban Christmas trees from the white house...but Teddy did
48730	agent_2:Yeah I know huh.  That is a nice paycheck.  I didnt realize jim carrey doesnt do dramas anymore.  agent_1:Yeah apparently they go against his belief system, I can respect that I like to keep a positive mindset as well.  agent_2:yeah, plus he is amazing in comedy.	agent_1:Yeah he sure is, do you like Ryan Stiles? do you know who he is?
35126	agent_1:Hello how are you doing?  Do you know much about Tesla? The tesla model s is road tested on an indoor track because their cars don't produce any emissions. agent_2:im good how are you? that's cool, I didn't know that but it makes sense considering ya there is no exhause agent_1:Yeah it does pretty interesting. The same guy, elon musk, founded paypal, spacex and tesla motors	agent_2:ya, and I never knew that elon musk was in thank you for smoking, I'll have to rewatch it
154434	agent_2:The banana part is hilarious)Maybe president twitter? agent_1:hmmm, or something else agent_2:I dont follow the election news that much. Was he elected the second time?	agent_1:No, its his first term.
5995	agent_2:I think I saw an animated film, probably Fantasia? A long time ago. I have heard good things about Frozen. agent_1:That was a while ago, an instant disney classic. Did you know toy companies get involved before they even make movies agent_2:The marketing and the licensing are all together on this. The film seems to be a giant commercial for toys! LOL	agent_1:For sure, that is a good way to put it! Do you have a favorite animal?
105231	agent_2:Did you see the one where they make fun of Family Guy in it? I thought that was awesome. And apparently the producers of The Simpsons that the South Park creators flowers afterwards agent_1:I did. It was very funny. I think it's hilarious that The Simpsons did that. Do you enjoy the Simpsons? agent_2:I do like the Simpsons. Apparently there's an episode where you never see Bart and he's also never mentioned. Have you seen that episode?	agent_1:I have not. I find it surprising that there is only one since it has been on so long.
74345	agent_2:I do not. It does sound interesting! agent_1:She writes books from the animals' perspectives, and even from a tree's perspective in a book about an Oak tree. agent_2:Have you read them?	agent_1:Not yet, but I'm curious. She's impressed by how idealistic today's children how, but I wonder if kids stay that way when they become adults.
48436	agent_2:Yeah I think it is down to those 2 for sure.  Its Giannis, he has had an amazing year so far, our whole team has.  agent_1:Yes Giannis thats it! He has a lot of good years ahead of him. It would be nice to see someone other then the Warrior win a title. Although I admire Curry's long ball, I remember watching Reggie Miller and thinking he could shoot, but Curry is so far ahead of anyone else.  agent_2:Yeah Curry's shooting ability is just insane, I don't watch them too much but you have to appreciate the dominance.  But same here I hope it's two different teams in the finals. 	agent_1:Well I will route for Milwaukee and Utah to duke it out for 7 games. That would be fun to watch Gobert vs Giannis. Even though there are 30 NBA teams it some times feels like there is really only 5-6.
58224	agent_1:do you watch wrestling? agent_2:I watch it sometimes. Do you watch it? agent_1:Yeah sometimes. In Turkey they put it all over their bodies and wrestle	agent_2:Wow that sounds very slippery. Lincoln was a great wrestler too
157069	agent_2:Richard Nixon was an actor before he became president.  I guess he somehow wasn't one of the wealthiest presidents though. agent_1:Wow I never knew that about Nixon. I know Reagan was also. agent_2:Or maybe it was Reagan I was thinking of.  See, I don't know much about presidents. 	agent_1:I don't either lol. At least I don't think I do. It was so nice chatting with you! Enjoy your weekend!
28851	agent_2:Oh, I absolutely agree. It's pretty scary how behind-the-times and tech-illiterate the people dictating our laws, institutions...virtually everything are. It definitely makes it that much harder to have any faith at all in these institutions, which you see evidence of everywhere, including in this storyâfrom Angilau and his family to the AP and beyond. agent_1:That's true, and not the only way this story makes me question my faith in the institution. I suppose I'd just assumed we had more of a right to know what's going on behind the doors of the systems we the people fund. agent_2:Government transparency is a laughable concept at this point. Always has been, but I think now people have more means to voice their frustrations and find platforms to draw attention to obstruction. What do you think about the fact that the FBI wouldn't identify the marshal? Right thing to do?	agent_1:If Angilau's actions were solely on his own part, it may have been alright to release the identity, but so long as it was legal, I understand the necessity to protect the Marshal from the retaliation of Angilau's gang. Even then, that should probably become public record at some point.
130494	agent_1:The innocence! I feel like it is more jaded now. Am I off on that? agent_2:It's definitely different now. It seems more capitalistic now, only putting the same certain people on the front page. It used to be a dating site when it began. agent_1:It's also the second largest search engine. Since google owns it, that makes sense.	agent_2:Absolutely. In 2007 YouTube used as much bandwidth as the entire internet in 2000. That's crazy!
159568	agent_2:HA! As long as he wasn't too bunched up. agent_1:Maybe we should stop monkeying around and talk about how the president of indonesia has 3 pop albums. agent_2:Oh no... You just won... I applaud you! My bunch was too much of a stretch but your monkey... Gold!	agent_1:What can I say, I'm pretty puny.
150619	agent_1:Did you know the city that is set to host the 2022 Qatar World Cup still does not exist? agent_2:What?! I had no idea. I know that it was set for Qatar but I was assuming it was in an existing city.  agent_1:Pretty crazy they don't even have the city yet. Did you know the Hungary national football team only had one defeat in 6 years and that was in the World Cup final.	agent_2:I would not think of them as a top football team but I believe that was in the 50's so I missed that time.
71553	agent_1:Yeah. DO you know who inspired such movies? agent_2:It was various people but Allen Poe and Bram Stoker and Mary Shelley were a few agent_1:Yeah. Do you like dogs?	agent_2:I love dogs. did you know they have 12 blood types?
58200	agent_1:I saw a picture of one where it ate something so big it's stomach had burst agent_2:Yeah that is truly amazing, I guess they can eat prey 2x the lenght and 10x it's weight! agent_1:I guess that prey was simply 1% too big and too heavy	agent_2:Lol, you are probably right, i wonder if us humans could do such things, I wonder what the Nathan's hot dog competition would look like?
164220	agent_2:A televised game lasts even longer than an hour, in my experience. I suppose we could use the tracking chips in the players' pads and the balls to find out how they really spend most of their time. agent_1:That is a great idea, that way we can tell the distance they actually run, the calories and many different stats about the game, cool facts and stats agent_2:More specifically, they use the tracking devices to track velocity, rotation, ball speed, and location.	agent_1:Do you like basketball as well?
68667	agent_2:Maybe.  It could be that they want to make sure the figurines are able to be made?  I dont know.  I never thought of that before. agent_1:Kind of makes me think differently now towards them. lol  The Lion King was the first Disney movie to be dubbed in Zulu for it's African release.  How interesting! agent_2:Yeah.  I wonder how many followed it.  It is neat to be ground breaking!	agent_1:I agree.  I have to get going.  Loved chatting with you!
9439	agent_1:Have you ever been to cgbg in NYC? The Ramones used to play there back in the day pretty often. agent_2:I'm familiar with both, but I think I'm too young to have experienced either of those things live haha.  agent_1:Me too, but I've been to cgbg before it closed down. I imagine the Ramones played a lot of similar punk rock scenes. I think I'm too old for a venue like that now haha.	agent_2:I guess the concerts that take place today aren't really the stuff of legend. For example, in 1972, Deep Purple broke the world record for loudest concert, in which three audience members were rendered unconscious. I can't see that happening today.
141618	agent_1:Probably, definitely not just the US, soccer isnt that big here. agent_2:No...which brings me to the last fact....Americans call it soccer because it was slang for association football. agent_1:We are good for making up words, lol.	agent_2:Yes! lol  I had fun chatting with you!  Hope you make a full recovery!  Have a blessed night!
92756	agent_2:Eddie Murphy was in the Nutty Professor.  agent_1:Whoops. LOL Well did you know Pixar named Wall-E as a tip of the hat to Walter Disney?  agent_2:I did not know that. Wall-E was such a cute movie too. That was a good tip of the hat.	agent_1:I thought it was a pretty good movie. Do you watch TV?
101058	agent_2:Yeah. Who's your favorite team? agent_1:My favorite is my hometown, the Redskins, but their performance has declined since Dan Snyder bought them.  agent_2:HA! I was so surprised when he brought in like Deion Sanders and Jason Taylor and a bunch of pro-bowlers. I was worried about my Bears!	agent_1:Yeah, that was a disaster. Did you know that on average an engineer will make more than the average NFL player?
145596	agent_2:I did!  It was a great book, but I am not sure why it qualifies as military reading. agent_1:Hm, maybe I'll check that one out! Also starship troopers is the first sci-fi novel on the reading lists of three of the five US military branches. Have you read that one? agent_2:I havent, but if the military recommends it, it might be a good read.	agent_1:Yeah, there's another one I may check out. Do you have a car? I don't at this time, but I'm going to need one soon! I am so sick of walking everywhere!
27001	agent_1:LOL  That's hilarious!  Me too I'm not good at all.  Bruce Lee was a great dancer!  That somewhat didn't surprise me since he had some good karate moves. agent_2:There was an episode of Mr Rogers where he learned to breakdance, I bet that was hillarious agent_1:I bet! haha  Michael Jackson had a patented devide that he used to get the extreme leans in some of his dance moves.	agent_2:I heard Michael Jackson didn't invent the moonwalk and the first ever recorded version was done by Bill Bailey in 1955
83483	agent_1:its just sad how music has changed  agent_2:What do you think about Canada requiring by law that 40% of the music has to be Canadian?  I thought they had freedom of speech there? agent_1:god , thats crazy 	agent_2:I still don't understand how radio works, but it says that soldiers in wwii made simple radios using a razorblade and pencil as the diode
55647	agent_2:I think it has to do with where your at.  In a town, a bowler is expected.  If your out there in the brush, the cowboy hat.  A bowler is like a half dome with a rim.  Tipping the hat is from knights in armor raising the face visor. agent_1:Oh, gotcha! You're really knowledgeable about hats! agent_2:As far as knowledge goes I prefer to wear a lamp shade at parties, not a conical paper hat. Party. Party.	agent_1:That would definitely be a conversation starter, just make sure it doesn't have any religious implications that could potentially offend someone, but I don't think a lamp shade would ;).
363	agent_2:Yes he was. He has a distinct voice so I don't know how I missed it initially.  agent_1:Good point. I didn't know rap was popular in Korea. They created a form of rap dueling called compliment battle! Well thanks for talking with me today! agent_2:I didn't know that either. That has to sound a lot different than the rap battles here. It was nice talking with you as well. 	agent_1:Yes here they are much more agressive! Have a good one!
15503	agent_2:Was that his gateway movie into the horrow genre? agent_1:Good question, I'm not quite sure, it sounds like Bambi! LOL agent_2:A man spent 10 years of his life in jail studying to become a lawyer. He proved his innocence so I guess it worked.	agent_1:Wow, so I guess he was better than the prosecutors, that's awesome!
149749	agent_1:There's so much rich history with football. I heard they didn't make nearly as much as they do today, though. I guess they earned like half of what professional bowling people earned. agent_2:Every wideout who has played here, there was always one kid that gets it. Just got rolled up on the back, and it happens all the time, and it was unfortunate that it had to be our very, very important player. Do you agree ? I was a little bit confused agent_1:Well, I guess I'm kind of a novice with the lack of opinions that a novice would have. I know some people are pretty hard-core fans about it, which I understand.	agent_2:lol, yes maybe. what opinion do you have about Air Force? I personally am not a fan
135677	agent_2:Michael Jordan?  agent_1:Michael Jordan was in the first Space Jam back in the 1990s. He really helped cause the value of basketball players to rise.  Nike knew it, so when his Air Jordan shoes were banned from the NBA, he wore them and Nike gladly paid the fine. agent_2:I saw that they paid the fine and still made money. How do you play 13,000 basketball games and only win 6? lol	agent_1:What team accomplished that awful feat?  It wasn't a team the inventor of basketball, James Naismith, coached was it?   I know he was like Kansas' only losing coach in history.
133370	agent_1:ya, it is extra funny too that wikileaks is the one that exposed the plot, against themselves haha agent_2:Yeah I that is funny. Do you think that immigration is as big of a deal as Trump is making out to be? agent_1:I don't know, I'd  have to see the numbers and I haven't looked them up, but what is nice is that Norway donated a big number, 1 billion dollars, to hlep save the rainforest	agent_2:Yeah, I hope they used it to do just that. We really need to stop destroying the earth.
100024	agent_2:I love to travel, mostly because I love coming home. I didn't know that about the king of Hawaii. I didn't actually know Hawaii had a king. But I did know that many people in Iceland who don't have cars travel by airplane, since there isn't a rail system. It seems kind of wasteful to me. agent_1:that does seem wasteful.  Does Iceland not have buses and trains? agent_2:I don't actually know. There's no public train system, but perhaps there's a bus system? Iceland isn't huge, so maybe it's not an issue. I wonder if it's cheaper than traveling in Japan, where all the highways have tolls. 	agent_1:I've heard about Japan.  They say it costs more than $300 to travel across the country!
52244	agent_2:The Green Mile has to be. Have you seen it? I cried like a baby with that movie. agent_1:I have seen it. I really love Forrest Gump. He can be so many characters agent_2:Well, that was a super good one, too, did you like Sleepless in Seattle? 	agent_1:No I have not. Have you seen a league of their own? that one gets me in the end
155257	agent_1:Ahah it certainly would be. Maybe they could stay in the guest house instead of the white house. It is bigger after all! agent_2:Trump could put up a big Trump sign on it and rent it out. Or do an AirBnB with it. Add a few stories.  agent_1:It would definitely be picked up on Fox News. Fox was actually created by Nixon, so maybe it would be spun into a positive light.	agent_2:Nixon, huh? In 2015, the median viewer age  was 68 years old for Fox News. Skewing pretty old and conservative. It's hilarious that Fox News threatened to sue the Simpsons. Fox hated the parodying its anti-Democratic party agenda. The Simpsons are Fox!
46474	agent_2:Hey, doing good!  I was just thinking about movies... comedy and drama in particular.  You a big fan of either, by chance? agent_1:movies. I like movies. I like dramas and comedies. You? agent_2:Yeah, they've pretty good!  Especially comedies.  Did you know Bill Murray is a big fan of the movie Kung Fu Hustle?  I've seen it; it's pretty hilarious!	agent_1:is it? i thought he was begin facetious when he said it was a great achievement.
44479	agent_2:I do watch YouToob. It's a good program. Very entertaining. agent_1:Me too, when I am bored I go to the site. It is the second largest search engine agent_2:It has many things to watch for free. I figure that I can save more money the more I watch. So I watch as much as possible.	agent_1:I am not surprised it beat out bing.com. I am glad I don't listen to baby by bieber anymore, it is the worst liked video
49588	agent_1:I didn't. how were the reviews? agent_2:I'm not sure? The present day events of the Incredibles is set in the 1960's. agent_1:I like the sequels premise of restoring trust in superheroes	agent_2:Yeah, I agree with you. Isn't it interesting the origins of comedy comes from ancient Greece.  Political satire was performed by comic poets at theaters.
84396	agent_2:Gymnastics and Wrestling, I think he also competed in Weightlifting, the long jump and shot put.  agent_1:That is interesting.  Do you like Gymnastics and wrestling? agent_2:I like them both maybe gymnastics a little more. Apparently the ancient Greeks practiced in order for war. Can imagine war being averted because of a wrestling match. 	agent_1:I thought they practiced to prepare themselves for war.  What do you mean a wrestling match?  I read recently that an american with a wooden leg won 6 medals in gymnastics.
109150	agent_2:Maybe. They sure do win a lot agent_1:They do, they have won or lost by 3 or 4 points in the last 6 tries taking out the one of this year, close scores agent_2:Did you know Brady threw 50 TDs in one season.	agent_1:Yeah he has a 50 record it happened on 2007, impressive record
148121	agent_1:I mean, that's a really valid excuse. I am not sure that would have helped me in high school though. agent_2:Me too!  lol  Jon Hamm taught drama at his old high school.  I loved watching Mad Men that he was in. agent_1:He had a famous student too. Erin from the office!	agent_2:Wow!  That's crazy.  Are you a fan of fantasy fiction?
5873	agent_1:Me too. Did you know in Japan every highway is a toll?  agent_2:the high speed highways impose a toll. the roads are not crowded though. you get what you pay for. did you want to go to Japan? agent_1:I want to visit. Did you know that Iceland had no public rail service? 	agent_2:Yes, i did know that. Japan on the other hand has a tremendous rail service. if you plan to visit, the rail system is better than the highway. however the air travel in Iceland is probably cheaper.
101313	agent_2:Thats great,  well I guess you will have incentive not to use your phone a lot.  agent_1:haha yup you're right! do you use a mac or a pc computer? agent_2:I have pc.  How about u?	agent_1:oh ya I have a pc, it has 16gb of ram, I guess the space shuttle only has 1mb haha
17164	agent_1:Yeah they netgotiated the terms of the soundtrack over pancakes, they even wore their robot helmets, hell of a breakfast agent_2:Interesting. I never knew Phil Collins worked on the Tarzan soundtrack, wasn't much of a good movie agent_1:I heard he recorded the sountack in 5 different languages, talented guy	agent_2:The batman begins soundtrack was pretty good, I never knew the track titles were names of bat genuses
70645	agent_1:I know! Can you imagine trying to catch the ball in the dark or try to figure out which way the batter was standing. That would be difficult!  agent_2:Exactly! That would be a bit frightening! So technology has come so far that cell phones are huge in so many ways, too bad we didn't have the ability long ago to record some of these games. agent_1:I know. It would have been so amazing to watch some of the early greats playing baseball. Still, I enjoyed not having phones when I was watching the games as I kid. I felt like I was more part of the game back then. Now, it seems like phones can be a distraction to spectators. 	agent_2:I agree, there are pro's and con's of these new phones. I am very happy to have grown up without computers or cell phones, we used our imaginations! We were outside mostly. But I am happy to have cell phones now but I am not addicted to them like many are.
111697	agent_1:Well you got me on that one! I had to look it up!  I'm obviously thinking of someone else! agent_2:HA! The Fred you are thinking of was on Law and Order, right? agent_1:I think so! I'm afraid to say now lol!  I was so focused on politics that he was on my mind I guess.  So, does that mean that Austin likes the singer or not?	agent_2:They don't like him. He's not very popular.
162292	agent_1:Now wouldn't that be funny!  Did you you know that 86% of the land in Nevada is owned by the US government?  That pretty much leaves Las Vegas and Reno as the only spots to live. LOL agent_2:yeah, that's lot of desert and secret military bases agent_1:No doubt!  In 2008 the Norwegian government donated $1 billion to help save the amazon rain forest.  That's a lot of money.  I wonder if it helped at all.	agent_2:Where did the money come from?
71621	agent_1:hey there, do you like dogs? agent_2:Hi! Yes I like dogs, I think they're very interesting creatures. What about yourself? agent_1:I love them. do you know dogs have 12 types of blood	agent_2:I didn't know that! I've heard they can actually donate blood at special blood drives, I'm sure that makes it more complicated.
4226	agent_2:No that's crazy, I wonder if they had cards of players on the 1908 World Series winning Cubs agent_1:That could be.  Did you also know that kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada? agent_2:No, that's an odd name. Did you know in baseball if a player catches a ball in their hat  the opposing team gets three bases instead of being out?	agent_1:That's cool. Did you know that after the Chicago Cubs won the 2016 World Series, over 5 million people celebrated in the streets, making it one of the largest gatherings in human history?
44536	"agent_2:Yeah but it ain't pretty... It's sort of the male version of Seinfeld's ""Elaine"" dance. Do you like video games like Fortnite? agent_1:I am not a huge fan of games but as per dance, I know some really famous people were good at it agent_2:Maybe they would like Fortnite; you can choose different parts of choreography from the game's item shop."	agent_1:Oh that is nice, and I guess more interactive. Did you know babies spontaneously dance to music?
139759	agent_1:well its on the top floor of the supreme court actually, do you think they ever actually play basketball up there? They're so old haha agent_2:I think they do, judges againsts judges, who rules in a game like that one lol agent_1:haha ya maybe they settle court cases up there, I just don't know haha	agent_2:Yeah, interesting way to break a tie, do you know who Reggie Miller is?
89920	agent_2:The most recent one? agent_1:The classic one; the first agent_2:Oh, weird. Maybe they valued actual acting less back then.	agent_1:I am going to find one of her old movies on Neflix now.
27784	agent_2:I am well, hoping you are too.  Yes I love sports!   agent_1:Yes, thank you. I am well. I really like golf, but I think some courses waste way too much water in a day. agent_2:Yeah, especially that one in Dubai!  	agent_1:Yes! I can not believe daily it requires 4,000,000 gallons! What a waste.
78354	agent_1:I want to travel within the country (US) nowadays.  Have you heard of Mackinac Island? agent_2:I have heard that they banned motor vehicles, but that is about it.   agent_1:the government intends to take care of it to make sure that the island historical symbols are preserved.	agent_2:That is pretty cool.  Did you know that all of Japan's highways are toll roads, and it costs $300 to go across the country in tolls?  Im glad not all US highways are like that.
61201	agent_1:hahaha that is funny. do you like swimming? agent_2:well I haven't swam since I was a kid but it is really fun, what about you? agent_1:yeah I love it really. have you heard the dolphin style swim competitions?	agent_2:haha I have, I guess they tie their hands and feet and swim like a dolphin like that, sounds exhausting!
117573	agent_1:I didn't know that Google went down for five minutes in 2013.  agent_2:me either, does it say why? agent_1:No, it doesn't. Probably there was a bug in the code. I'm skeptical about the fact that Google uses goats to mow its lawns. Can I trust the information that I'm reading here?	agent_2:Actually you can! I did a report in college about it!
58071	agent_2:That's pretty interesting since Youtube and Netflix are internet based companies! agent_1:I am always contributing to that, one way or the other! agent_2:Yeah me too and did you know that Youtube first started out as a dating website? Of course that makes sense since its name youtube	agent_1:It is also the second largest search engine.
43792	agent_1:I follow the Knicks in New York, I guess they call NY the mecca of basketball because the NBA was founded there in 1949 agent_2:That makes sense. the founder was James naismith. i figure the man is a legend. agent_1:Yea, too bad Naismith never got a shoe deal like Allen Iverson's lifetime contract with Reebok	agent_2:Yeah, i dont think that he made much money, but he has an award named after him. thats pretty good.
7486	agent_2:Ugh, that has got to be the worst. Even with standard clothing it's got to be expensive and then occasions come up where you need things like suits and you know odds are they are only going to wear it once.  agent_1:We are sticking with a lot of khaki pants and nice dress shirts. If he has to have a suit, we'll have to buy it a couple of days before the event, there's no other way to deal with it. agent_2:That is a really smart plan. Forget even trying to tailor it, it will never be worth the cost and time.	agent_1:I agree totally, tailoring is not worth it at all. I've been lucky with consignments and things so far, but the more he grows and the older he gets, I can't do that as much anymore. I just hope that puberty won't be terribly long as far as the growing is concerned.
45187	agent_2:Yeah, digital is definitely the way to go nowadays.  But actual vinyl albums, spun at 78-rpms, are making a comeback. agent_1:i think that is awesome, amazing how you could fill a room with vinyl where the same amount of music can fit on your phone now  agent_2:For sure.  And the really big ones spun at 33 rpms can really be worth some money now a days.	agent_1:i bet
32291	agent_1:Oooh,  I never saw that one!  Was it good?   agent_2:Yes. Matthew Broderick was in that one too if I recall. Maybe even Forest Whitaker. Did yo know there is an actor named Denzel Whitaker, who was in a movie with Denzel Washington and Forest Whitaker? agent_1:hahaha that is so weird!  How does that even happen.  	agent_2:Chance I guess.  I like Denzel in American Ganster too, but I was creeped out by the movie Fallen. It is a good one if you have not seen it!
100500	agent_1:Did you know that McDonald's added drive-thrus in 1975 to accommodate soldiers who were not allowed to get out of their cars while wearing fatigues. agent_2:The US replaced animal-drawn carriages with cars really fast compared to other parts of the world like Western Europe.  agent_1:Yeah they did. Did you know that it's legal to equip your car with flame-throwers in South Africa? I wonder when Elon Musk will add that to a Tesla?	agent_2:interesting. I have heard that they allow it to try to prevent carjackings, I wonder if it helps.
98557	agent_1:It was, due to soldiers not being able to exit their cars in fatigues. agent_2:That's fairly genius of them since they would have attracted all those solders!  agent_1:Definitely.  In south Africa it is actually LEGAL to put flame throwers on your car to prevent car jackings.	agent_2:Carjacking must be a serious problem there for that to be a viable solution. I wonder if that's a common alarm system, or if it's something that's merely legal, but no one really attempts
121038	agent_1:I love baseball. Who's your favorite team? agent_2:I love the Cleveland Indians because I'm from that region. agent_1:I love the Cincinnati Reds because I'm from that area lol. Looks like we are both in Ohio. 	agent_2:lol  I actually saw the Reds back in the late 80s and early 90s at the old Riverfront stadium.  I was going to college in Columbus and we drive down there for Reds games!
97133	agent_1:Really? That sounds like something I would like. Are both seasons good? agent_2:Yes and the third season is set in mid-1985. Thats a fun walk down memory lane. agent_1:Speaking of Netflix, from 9pm to 12am, Netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in north america.	agent_2:I know! Netflix has some odd fun facts!
112016	agent_2:That's interesting another cool facts is that dogs and elephants are the only animals to understand pointing I guess both are really smart. agent_1:They probably are both very smart, indeed. Also, did you know that Google prefers dogs to cats? Their code of conduct specifically states that they are a dog company? agent_2:I did know, Google is a dog company, I think that's great as I said before I am a dog person.	agent_1:I like animals in general as long as they are not going to hurt me in anyway.  There are so many animals in the world.  Did you know that it's estimated that there are over 7 million animal species?
21176	"agent_2:I honestly don't know! I know he has a university named after him though. agent_1:I think he's from the Toronto, Canada area.  He received a grammy award for Best Rap Song for his ""Hotline Bling"" song. agent_2:Thats really neat! I've read that he likes to play fortnite too!"	agent_1:How interesting is that?  I like how he visited Drake university one night during a tour stop.  The students there were trying to get him to come there and he did go only after they gave up trying to get him to come.  It's been a good chat!
87713	agent_2:It might be. Have you ever seen the movie Frozen? I haven't but did you know that Disney renamed it to Frozen instead of Snow Queen because they blamed feminine titles for poor box offices. agent_1:I haven't seen it. It was directed by a woman right? The title might not do much. agent_2:It was, her name is Jennifer Lee and she is the 1st female director of a Disney animation studios film  and it earned more than $1B in box office revenue.	agent_1:She must have a great touch. I wish her the best of luck! I guess it has a bunch of great songs too.
100606	agent_1:I don't know.  I have no opinion. About Cardi B, I know who she is but I have never heard any of her songs. agent_2:lol almost the same here, well with the beard thingie, you know whats weird, every US president with a beard has been a republican, so since Its more of a republican thing to say America First i though Having a beard would not only be Republican but also american lol agent_1:I know - I researched it because you asked me about it.	agent_2:hahaaaaa, yeah its funny but true, lol
66003	agent_2:Yes I don't know! Hopefully he had a good time though. Have you ever used Airbnb before? Apparently there is a version of that but for sleeping on couches agent_1:Sure, I used Airbnb a lot. Did you use this couch surfing website? agent_2:No I haven't used it. But I have used Airbnb. When you did travel though to other countries, did you notice that airports would just put baggage claim further from the airplane? Instead of making the baggage claim system faster?	agent_1:Really? Do you think it is done for the purpose?
16363	agent_1:I could see it though because if he wants to portray the character in a certain way watching an edited version might change that subtly and affect the quality of his work agent_2:Yes I guess that's a very good point. Do you know why the avengers caused a notable increase in shawarma sales? agent_1:That is hilarious. I could totally see that too. There are so many funny memes about how the avengers are sitting in that schwarma restaurant and the workers are going about things like nothing happened. 	agent_2:Oh I see that explains it! Yes that was hilarious. I love having The Avengers on Netflix so I can watch at anytime. From 9pm to 12am Netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in North America!
33124	agent_2:It is a possibility, and a scary one at that considering the rate we are destroying out planet.  80% of the natural forests are gone. agent_1:That is sad, humans have really damaged the planet and we've only exist for 1 minute and 17 seconds  of the history of earth agent_2:We have made so much development, but it has cost us so much.  The Earth will be helium free bt the end of the 21st Century.	agent_1:Sounds like we need to protect or helium reserves, no more balloons or funny voices.
128345	agent_1:For real, however I always feel a strong urge to jump on turtle shelled ducks, and throw their shells at walking mushrooms. agent_2:Yes, LOL! i think that maybe violence on TV desensitizes us to violence. i think that FOX news turned out parents into the people that they thought video games would turn us into. agent_1:I agree with that.  We are so used to seeing it that we dont think anything of it anymore.	agent_2:it is dangerous to think the media doesnt have an effect, but usually people imagine the wrong effect.
15	agent_1:Did you know that a seahorse is the only fish to have a neck?  agent_2:Freshwater fish only drink water through the skin via Osmosis, Saltwater fish drink water through the mouth. Dolphins are friendly to human beings. agent_1:Interesting, they also have gills. Did you know that jellyfish are immortal? 	agent_2:Yes. Fish is the important resources of human world wide for the commercial and subsistence fish hunts the fish in the wild fisheries.
24136	agent_2:Agreed!  Speaking of Marvel.  Who is your favorite villain?   agent_1:Ah, now that is a hard choice. It is probably Thanos because of all the memes  circulating him. 'Thanos Truck' agent_2:Those are pretty cool.  Red Skull may not be my favorite, but he is scary.  That Super-Soldier Formula can be rough on a guy, apparently.  	agent_1:Do you prefer marvel or DC comics? I prefer Marvel
126811	agent_1:It takes me 30 minutes to drive each way so when I do work from home, I spend an additional hour working instead of driving. agent_2:What do you think of the flamethrower idea to prevent carjacking that they use in south-africa? agent_1:I mean, if it's a problem in the country, I wouldn't want to get car jacked.	agent_2:I wonder if supervisors who don't like telecommuting are more concerned with internet security or not being able to ensure their employees aren't being influenced by things like dropping acid.
148242	agent_2:Yeah I love Jim Carrey.  I actually just wated Liar Liar again last night,  one of my favorites from him lol  agent_1:One of my favorites as well, too bad he doesnt make dramas anymore but I have to respect his reason agent_2:Yeah,  I hear he is taking the positive roles now.  Which I think is fantastic!	agent_1:Yeah positivity is a graet mindset to follow, do you like to watch TV?
100679	agent_1:Wow.  I can't believe Blockbuster declined several times to buy Netflix for $50 million.  Big mistake on their part. agent_2:That's a huge loss for Blockbuster. Netflix was started by Reed Hastings all because he had a $40 late fee on a copy of Apollo 13. agent_1:They must have really mad him mad!  lol  Switching gears..did you ever watch the drama House by any chance?	agent_2:I have not seen it yet. Have you?
84712	agent_2:Oh neat hobby! It could pay off big someday. I heard that Japan is big time ino baseball. I guess they are surprised that its our pastime.  agent_1:Yeah, they love it over there. You would figure that they know it is a big thing here too.  agent_2:HA, I would like to listen to the games on the radio. I often listen to old radio broadcasts now.  A website offers thousands of free ones.	agent_1:That is pretty cool, do you know what radio station it is?
79626	agent_2:Bambi? Is that not a kids movie, animated? agent_1:Yeah it is and he considers it the most horror movie ever agent_2:Wow, interesting. He lets aspiring filmmakers do adapt his short stories for $1	agent_1:I guess the challenge is how well can they do it, he is pretty twisted with his stories
59138	agent_2:That is! The first computer algorithm was written by a woman named ada lovelace. agent_1:Smooth! Somebody built a working 16 bit computer using minecraft building blocks. I'd like to have seen it. agent_2:Space ships only use a 16 bit computer when they fly into space!	agent_1:Good one! If we viewed earth's history as a 24 hr block, human's existence would be equal to one minute.
146746	agent_2:I really dislike the Packers!!!!  They are one of the Bears enemies and I cannot support them nor associate with their fans!  Sorry I am a bit of a sore sport when it comes to matches between the Bears and Packers.  I lived close to Chicago growing up and still do and I seek out their matches every year. agent_1:That's cool. I am more interested in the statistics and data about football than the actual teams. I want to see some of the info from the chips they put on the players and the balls.  agent_2:Stats are great to go off of to.  I love stats.  Without them it would be hard to predict which teams will match up with each other prior to the years beginning of Football.  I am a major fan so its nice to stick to the stats.  Do you like Eli Manning?	agent_1:I don't mind him. He seems like quite the player.
124095	agent_1:Yes, Definitely, one of my favorites by him is Shawshank Redemption. I love Drama films. agent_2:I didn't know that Patrick Stewart teaches drama in the UK. I wonder who his students are. agent_1:I did not know that, interesting! I was reading about the 2 masks you see together that represents Drama is a division of comedy and tragedy, interesting	agent_2:The history of drama is fascinating. The history of soap opera is that the soap companies sponsored the shows.
54719	agent_1:good for them. they donated 1 billion to save the amazon rainforest agent_2:ah that is good, did you know that the USA publishes the names of people that renounces their USA citizenship? agent_1:I did not know that, strange though. do you have a favorite piece of clothing?	agent_2:well I have things I like to wear, I do wear shirts though what about you? I
29852	agent_2:It is a shame about the high percentage of players going broke after retirement agent_1:Yeah, I suppose that is true. There used to be a show about it.  agent_2:Really? Do you remember what it was called?	agent_1:30 for 30 or something like that. I can't quite remember.
83763	agent_1:Exactly..so you just have to hope for the best and try to stay out of the back and forth I guess.   agent_2:sure, but some offenses are not even by private people... sometimes it's news websites, newspapers, or even president of the United States... how do yOu protect Yourself from that... agent_1:yeah that is definetly a good question.  I really don't know but I guess like I said earlier they are going to have to change some laws to accommodate our changing times.	agent_2:Maybe the answer is in raising young people ( children ) ? to be more tolerant and not such jerks all the time ;) lol
111924	"agent_1:Interesting, I usually wear jeans, but to work I wear ""trousers."" agent_2:That's interesting. I saw that a D.C. judge once sued a dry cleaning business for the loss of a pair of pants.  agent_1:Interesting. Those must have been some nice freaking pants!"	agent_2:haha I bet! It said he sued them for over $67 million.
9937	agent_1:I also love it, its a genre with a lot of history and interesting roots, all the way back to th 19th century agent_2:Doesn't come from african roots type music? agent_1:Yeah in the late 19th century, in communities of New Orlans, such a great genre, relaxing and nice to listen at	agent_2:Did you know Clint Eastwood is a huge Jazz fan?
99518	agent_1:The only thing about this Magnum PI is he does not have a mustache like the Tom Selleck version agent_2:Awww well that kills it lol I hear the term soap opera because shows were being sponsored by soap manufacturers lol  agent_1:I did not know that.  Makes sense	agent_2:Yeah I guess so,  Ive always wondered lol
121826	agent_1:I did not. I wonder why? It was sooo good here! agent_2:I know but there they remade it verbatim so it only lasted 10 episodes agent_1:That's why it failed! I feel like it oculd have done better if it was written for that audience. Did you ever see the British version of the office?	agent_2:I have not actually just the American one, is it good?
21032	agent_1:I did not know that either. I don't know why it would be a biohazard but I understand it voiding the warranty because the nicotine would gum up the internal parts. Someone built a working 16-bit computer using nothing but the basic minecraft building blocks. It's amazing how far we have come! agent_2:It truly is amazing. Well transhumanists want to upload their minds to memory sticks and computers, that is certainly interesting.  agent_1:I think we are a long way from that technology. They sure have covered that concept several times on the series Black Mirror. 	agent_2:It sure has been. To think all the technology we have and yet they still experiment on animals in useless, archaic and unnecessary experiments. RH monkeys are such an abused group.
93639	agent_2:Hello! I'm doing well Thank you, How are you? agent_1:I'm groovy man. Do you use Facebook? agent_2:I am glad! Yes, I do. Its a great way to connect with the World. Hey, btw, do you enjoy a good glass of Wine? or not a wine fan?	agent_1:Wine? Never heard of it. What is it?
55810	agent_1:Good question, maybe it was some sort of musical instrument before? It was in the Shining for sure! The child actor who played Danny Boy didn't realize he was acting in a Horror Film. I wonder when he found out? agent_2:Maybe he got old enough to watch his own movie? Haha. I wonder what he thought was going on if he wasn't aware that's what filming a movie was. Did he just think life was that dark and creepy? agent_1:Yes because there was a lot of blood too! I am curious to know. Kind of like when Stephen King saw Bambi for the first time and was terrified!	agent_2:I was traumatized by Bambi too! Weren't you? It was the first movie I remember seeing where anyone died! It's funny to think of that inspiring Stephen King though isn't it?
9539	agent_1:And now they have everything in there. it is the largest search engine on the net agent_2:Well yeah they ended up getting bought by Google in 2006 and added the power of Google's search engine so that make sense for sure. agent_1:yeah. originally they had a lower view count but were forced to upgarde it after gandnam style song	agent_2:Now all kinds of networks like CBS, BBC and Hulu use it for their content.  But you can always watch Bob Ross instead.
132314	agent_1:Seinfeld is pretty funny, so is the fact the White House still uses floppy disks agent_2:That's amazing. I read somewhere that before they retired the space shuttle, to repair it they had to scavenge 80s-era computer hardware from junkyards and abandoned hospitals and stuff to find parts for it. agent_1:Lol, I'm sure they find a treasure trove of parts in the White House then	agent_2:I'll bet! Probably doesn't help that most politicians are they type who had their secretaries print out their emails for them to read and dictated replies. Dianne Feinstein was surprised her encounter with the Sunrise kids showed up on the Internet so quickly.
4993	agent_1:Yeah, that is interesting. Did you know Kickball is also called Soccer Baseball in Canada?  agent_2:no, but I suppose the name does make sense! I like baseball though, it is americas pastime! agent_1:Yeah, it is a good sport. It is also really popular in Japan. 	agent_2:I heard they are usually surprised how popular it is in America too!
53887	agent_2:He was named mvp 4 years in a row agent_1:Can you imagine being that great at anything, let alone basketball? I can barely manage to get myself dressed in the morning. agent_2:Lol same here. Especially straight out of highschool. Did you know Kevin love broke his hand and missed 21 games.	agent_1:I did know that. He seems to get hurt all the time. He was out for a period of time this year too. Although I would probably found a way to strain a hammy too if I played on CLE.
98811	agent_2:Yes Have you heard of the the highest court in the land agent_1:Yes that is in the US supreme court top floor	agent_2:Yeah I wonder how many people get to play there
116071	agent_1:I didn't hear about that.  He hhit the jackpot.  Have you heard of those flame throwing cars they have in South Africa to prevent car jackings?  Yikes! agent_2:Scary isn't it. They must have a lot of problems with carjacking!! I would like to see how that works on the car! agent_1:I bet it's crazy.  Do you know when McDonalds added drive-thrus?	agent_2:Was it in 1975, for the soldiers that were wearing fatigues?
25044	agent_1:True, I'm sure there will be a list of new ones coming out this year! I really enjoy Comedy!  Did you know Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 of their shows? agent_2:No that's a lot! Did you know the trope of slipping on a banna peel was a reference to slipping on horse poop? agent_1:What? that's crazy!! lol Do you like Jack Black? He's pretty funny guy. He was suppose to play in the Green Lantern film.	agent_2:I had no idea, kinda strange, so was The Empire Strikes Back being nominated as best comedy by the writers guild
29734	agent_1:That would be a better choice. A nba hall of famer Reggie Miller scored a career high 40 points in 1982. Sad thing is is that his sister scored 105 points and broke 8 records, Reggie couldn't escape his older sister's shadow. agent_2:Well he is a pro player and his sister isn't so i think that is good enough. agent_1:At the time he was only in high school, so it must have sucked then. 	agent_2:But now he is in the nba hall o fame
117986	agent_2:That's not exactly true, many of them have expressed their views on social media. agent_1:that's true but its only started happening more recently. It's sad that things had to get so bad for people to start making stands. agent_2:American politics are insane. Strom Thurmond holds the record for the longest filibuster, he talked for 24 hours. Amazing.	agent_1:Oh yeah they sure are. Americans take it very very seriously also, so much so that fights break out over who has the better candidate. I think the whole American political system needs to be fixed. Get rid of the two party system all together, and the electoral college.
95133	agent_2:I sure do. Did you ever watch the Simpsons? agent_1:Yes I did, there is an episode where Bart does not appear agent_2:Yea and he is not even mentioned in that episode	agent_1:Yeah. Did you ever watch That 70s SHow?
3495	agent_1:Yes because they can play of the team needs them to agent_2:Yeah. Do you know what kickball is called in Canada? agent_1:Yes it is called soccer-baseball	agent_2:Yeah I guess it makes sense because it has elements from both games
115398	agent_2:It wouldn't surprise me to be honest.  agent_1:ha for sure, they are kind of out there. it was to keep their feet warm after leaving the water. Good chatting with you! agent_2:Were they california surfers? 	agent_1:yes
27339	agent_2:Good!  You?  Do the stars fascinate you? agent_1:I do , its apparently one of the oldest natural sciences. So i guess we have always be fascinated by stars. agent_2:Astronomy also lead to the creation of wifi!  I didnt know that!	agent_1:Neither did I, and the early space shuttle had only 1 mb of ram.
117611	agent_1:That is hilarious lol. She was also the first fan hit by a puck at the Florida Panthers arena. She was 5! agent_2:Lol, that is pretty funny, so is Grande being caught licking a donut display\ agent_1:Haha she's bad. Although she has done some good like that charity concert where she raised 13 million dollars for the victims.	agent_2:Yea plus Grande even made an appearance at Aretha Franklin's funeral
117633	agent_1:Hi.  I guess for those people missing NFL games they can do fantasy.  I know my grandson is really into it.  He's a huge Andrew Luck fan and hopes to ride him to a good season. agent_2:i have never tried fantasy sports. how does it work? do you bet or something? agent_1:There's different systems but the basics are that you make a team based on individual players and then play games.  Your points are based on how well your players do.  Some leagues you pay to join, i.e. bet, others are just for fun.  It's perfect for a statistics nerd.  Like one who knows Luck's QB rating is 102.4.	agent_2:could i choose the same players as your son then? no limitations?
132149	agent_2:Who knows, he should do something artistic, like the president of Indonesia, you know what he did? agent_1:No not really, what did the president of Indonesia do? agent_2:He released 3 pop albums while in office! I gotta listen to them	agent_1:He must be really talented, seems like he had a lot of free time while in office, maybe he can teach Trump a trick or two
21380	agent_2:Yes I bet so too. Did you heard about that really bad creed concert? agent_1:Yes so bad that people sued them at the end of it agent_2:Yeah that must have cost them more than the concert itself	agent_1:Yeah. Do you use google much?
99498	agent_1:Thats good.  Homeland is very entertaining, but stressful lol  agent_2:Have you heard an actor named Hugh Laurie? agent_1:I think he is the actor from House?	agent_2:Yes. Apparently, he is the highest paid actor ever for tv drama - $700k per episode.  Have you ever seen House?
132695	agent_1:It is bad how people drive. I used to yell at people and maybe flip them off. But then my wife convinced me that it could get me shot. agent_2:I know it's so bad on your nerves, my goodness! She's right, there are just as many crazies out there!! agent_1:Right. But it's not worth getting killed over. Did you know that the trunk of you car is call that because old cars had wooden trunks strapped to the back?	agent_2:Yes, I did! Makes sense, Did you know Karl Benz patented his Benz motorwagen n 1886?
32960	agent_2:no I actually do not. did you know eminem wanted to be a comic book artist originally? agent_1:OH wow!  No i didn't!  Not sure if tupacs music really deserves to be in the library of congress! agent_2:i think so, he revolutionized the music type in a sense	agent_1:Then i wonder if two live crew and the beasty boys are in there?
69028	agent_1:I think I read that somewhere and found it surprising. Thank heavens Netflix lets us watch comedy over and over again!  agent_2:Yeah imagine if they took all of the comedy related content out of Netflix?  That would be such a huge chunk of their stuff! agent_1:Which just goes to show you that folks these days are looking for entertainment that allows them to possibly escape from their everyday reality.	agent_2:Yeah and comedy is a great way to do it.  Did you that the Green Lantern film was originally going to be a comedy?
62060	agent_1:Yea but I haven't seen Cloverfield. I did watch War Machine with Brad Pitt, which I found disappointing agent_2:Oh I never heard of that.  did you know netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth? agent_1:That's crazy Netflix still does that since it's been focusing on releasing it's own content to get more subscribers	agent_2:yeah,  well some people still dont know how to use the internet or don't have internet lol like my grandparents and some of my aunts.
31867	agent_1:I think that is incredibly hilarious! I thought the loch ness monster was a myth! I mean, I suppose all myths have a basis in fact, but it's still weird. And Scotland still hasn't changed it. What do you think about there being 20 quantillion animals individually on Earth? agent_2:I can't even imagine that many but I suppose it is true.  All you have to do is look around in daily life and there's animals from insects on up everywhere.   agent_1:Ones that we can't even notice because they are so small. And ones that come out in different seasons. Did you know that Venus does not have seasons?	agent_2:I do think I have heard something about it before.  That just seems so odd and also so boring.  Nothing on Venus ever changes.  It rotates different than all of the others as well, except for uranus that is.
55240	agent_1:Oh no, I meant the name of the moon is Phobos.  It's 1/3 hollow and some believe it to be artificial in origin because of this. agent_2:Sorry, I misread. I do remember in KS Robinson's Mars trilogy there was a big orbital colony inside Phobos, so maybe that was based on the idea of it being hollow. agent_1:It probably was.  You know I was thinking about those interns selling stolen moon rocks that you mentioned before.  I've heard that moon dust can cut through kevlar like material and is harmful to us.  I wonder if people got hurt or sick from the rocks.	agent_2:No kidding? Hopefully they didn't inhale the dust.
35083	agent_1:Right, you think they would test them outdoors since they are used outdoors lol. agent_2:Elon Musck also founded Paypal and SpaceX right? agent_1:Yea that guy is mega rich and innovative. He also produced movies too!	agent_2:He has? that is so cool I heard he was planning to colonize Mars, can you imagine that.
159370	agent_2:I heard that! That is awesome, and interesting, how about Pokemon, have you ever watched any of the 750 episodes? agent_1:No, I never got into the pokemon craze, even after it being on for 16 years.   agent_2:I was as a kid, but now that it is back I don't care anymore. I did probably  watch a majority of those episodes as a kid.	agent_1:I commute so I always have the radio on.  I was in Canada the other day and I couldn't find a station playing an american artist.  I guess they are required to play 40% canadian music.
18704	"agent_1:Interesting. John Legend is nominated for an emmy too for ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" agent_2:Yes, you are right, did you see it? agent_1:No but  I hope John Legend get an emmy so he can add to his grammy,, oscar, and tony wins"	agent_2:That is good. Do you remember Julia Louis-Dreyfus?
29913	agent_2:Yup the guys is a legend now in the NBA. Do you know why he signed with Under Armor? agent_1:I do not know about that actually. DO you know what his first name is? agent_2:Well it was because of a glitch that Nike kept on they PPP with the name of Kevin Durant in it	agent_1:Oh I see, that is a big mistake on their behalf. He was born in the same place as LeBron
13664	"agent_1:Hi! It's so insane that women couldn't vote just a short time ago. I remember my grandma telling me about that.  agent_2:It is strange to think about. I think it is irresponsible not to vote in this day and age. It is a hard fought right and we should take advantage fo that.  agent_1:I agree. I was always encouraged to vote. However, i do think that Tina Fey was unfair saying that white college educated women turned the election and now ""want to go back to watching HGTV"""	agent_2:I agree that was a comment that was only intended to incite people not bring about any actual rational discussion.
86518	agent_2:Imagine being at one of those concerts and one of the greats stops by. I think I would lose it right then and there.  agent_1:I wouldnt even recognize them if I were there,  since I do not keep up with jazz at all lol  agent_2:I would probably recognize the playing rather than the artist themselves unless someone like Clint Eastwood stopped by. Him or his son I would recognize. 	agent_1:I see.  I would recognize clint eastwood I think lol I found out he is alleric to horses lol
155976	"agent_1:Yea, Pokemon averages 50 episodes a year for 16 years agent_2:Yes, you dont see shows do 50 episodes a year anymore. agent_1:No, some shows don't even last 10 episodes like the UK version of That 70s Show ""Days Like These"""	agent_2:I read where Ringo has narrated 52 episodes of Thomas the tank engine,
141312	agent_2:The one about unfriending people? Make enemies for fast food calories! LOL. I wonder how well the promo did. agent_1:Maybe good, they keep doing it. agent_2:I guess it would get people out of the house. They would still bring their phones though.	agent_1:People are attached them, I know I cant live without my iphone.
69756	agent_1:Which social media do you use? agent_2:I am a Facebook user not into much other than that, how about you? agent_1:What is Facebook used for you? I use Facebook when there are special events coming up. I use Instagram.	agent_2:I like it because my out of state family uses Facebook so I go on a couple times a week to chat with them. I have snapchat too.
97666	agent_1:Me too!  lol  I wonder who made the decision at Myspace to pass up buying Facebook for $75 million in early 2005?   agent_2:Probably someone who ended up getting fired.  lol.  Now its worth 104 BILLION!!! agent_1:I know right?  lol  I find it fascinating that it is primarily blue because Mark Zuckerburg suffers from red-green color blindness.	agent_2:That is neat.  I guess you would want to distinguish the product you made easily.
111223	agent_2:That seems like a really nice and relaxing place, away from pollution and just a simple place agent_1:Yes, good point. They use horse drawn carriages and bikes. No pollution there at all. They Have done it for hundreds of years too. agent_2:Sure sounds like a beautiful place, what about Iceland? have you ever traveled there?	agent_1:Never been there but I know they have no public rail service. That is kind of intimidating to me.
60887	"agent_2:Undoubtable in the victorian age.  What I recently learned that a cult favorite movie ""Starship Troopers"" as first a book. agent_1:I suppose most movies are books.  Disney movies were often based upon books.  Are you a fast reader?  Anne Jones has the world record with 4,700 words per minute. agent_2:Not very fast, more thorough.  I tend to read twice before grasping.  I gues it is because of the complex subtlies of language."	agent_1:If you are into sci-fi, Starship Troopers is recommended by 3 of the 5 us military branches.
123499	agent_2:Right, as biased as Fox News is, CNN and MSNBC can be worse at times.  In 2015 the median viewer age for Fox news was 68 years old.  Do you think that number will get lower or higher? agent_1:I believe both. Most conservatives watch Fox news. I did not know Richard Nixon was one of the creators. agent_2:Me neither.  The President seems to primarily watch Fox News.  Did you know the only US president to have a PHD was Woodrow Wilson?	agent_1:No, I did not. How would you like your president to be called banana?
57095	agent_1:It is, they are surprised we call it our past time agent_2:Yeah exactly. Do you know when the World Series was founded? agent_1:Wasn't it 1903?	agent_2:Yup, so they are pretty old now over 100 years. The Ottoman EMpire was still in existence then
62474	agent_1:Hi, how are you? agent_2:I am good.  I was so happy to heard about the 11 year old battling cancer getting birthday gifts from strangers. agent_1:Stories like this one always warms my heart. I love them!	agent_2:Yes she got lots of paper flowers and over a hundred packages.
85663	agent_2:Good to know about the 7%.  I myself am to lazy to read terms on the internet. agent_1:I read most of it.  definitely not all.  agent_2:So, you are one of the 7%?  Just kidding.	agent_1:Lol Yes! It doesn't even matter,  cuz even if they say something bad in the terms of service I justify it in my head because I need my phone service lol
85923	agent_2:Hello! I have watched most of the movies and loved the toys as a kid! agent_1:Awesome!  I can't believe it's been 12 years since the first one came out in 2007.  Time is flying by. agent_2:Geez! I can imagine the movie did take along time to put together considering how fast the CGI goes	agent_1:Yes!  in the 2007 film did you know there are an average of 1.53 explosions per minute? lol
28708	agent_2:I like that. The guy who impersonated a French government official and sold the Eiffel Tower is my hero. There was a Beverly Hillbillies episode where a local con man sold the Clampetts the freeway, Griffith Park and a whole lot of other stuff. agent_1:that is very ballsy! like he did it not just one time, but two times, like wasn't 1 enough haha agent_2:There's something appealing about that kind of shameless scoundrel. I just wonder who actually fell for it -- must've been the perfect combination of rich and dumb.	agent_1:haha yup that takes a special kind of person, like the kind of person who thinks Bambi is a horror movie haha
109849	agent_2:Good use of tax money again!  Did you know that officials in ancient athens were appointed by lottery because elections they felt could lead to oligarchy.  Wonder how that would work today? agent_1:I don't think it could go any worse than some of our previous elections! How crazy is it that the president's guest house is actually bigger than the White House? Go figure that the guest would be treated better than the president themselves agent_2:Voter turnout is less than 62.8% for the last 100 years.	agent_1:Thats kind of a shame... what even more shocking than people not voting, is the fact that 75% of the time, since 1900, the taller candidate won. Wonder if this was purposely?
83028	agent_2:Yes a lot actually. Do you know who invented it? agent_1:Hmmm I do not know that. Who was it? agent_2:It was an undertaker who though he was losing business because they were rerouting his calls to others	agent_1:Nice. Do you know why the NY area code is 212?
147313	agent_2:Yeah they are tracking so many things now. Do you know Alex SMith? agent_1:Wasn't he like a genius? I think he took a lot of AP tests in high school agent_2:Yeah so then he managed to wrap up college in just 2 years	agent_1:That's impressive! Have you heard the story about the circular huddle used in football? Like the history of it?
21074	"agent_1:Yes, it could be even worse if they post rap battles that they get involved in. That would get a lot of dis-likes in public opinion, maybe even as many as the most disliked video on YouTub, Justin Bieber's ""Baby."" agent_2:Poor Justine.  Maybe he should have become a comic book artist.  agent_1:Well, he does have plenty of illustrations on his body nowadays--probably trying to imitate rappers that he admires! Maybe he also admires comic book heroes the way Eminem does and could add a Spiderman tattoo."	agent_2:I didn't realize Drake was so young, only graudating HS in 2012.
144878	agent_2:I know listening to music still makes me smile inside. agent_1:Music is great,  I love listening to it while snowboarding.  agent_2:What type of music genre do you listen to while snowboarding? I'm sure it's fast.	agent_1:It doesnt have to be fast,  I like anything that sounds good,  I have a mixture of music, rap, dub step, disney, dance music, country, soundtrack stuff.
108274	agent_2:Yeah. Did you know that Venus does not tilt at all? agent_1:Yes and that us why it has no seasons and it rotates clockwise agent_2:Yeah. There is another planted where it rains glass shards	agent_1:Yes and it does so sideways at 4500 mph, scary
162255	agent_1:He wanted to continue his career. Why did he have to retire then? agent_2:I'm not sure he wanted to continue it, but from personal experience once someone retires passion gets lost and that could kill you, so changing the subject a bit you know that Trumps guest house is bigger than the White House? agent_1:That is sad. To be honest, his ideas are different.	agent_2:I don't agree with much of his ideas either, I think we made a mistake when he got elected but oh well there's not much we can do now.
113692	agent_2:Tupac is a classic. His music is in the library of congress of cultural significance. agent_1:He was an amazing talent. a great rapper and a dancer as well.  agent_2:Yes very true. Today though rap is so closely associated with hp hop they almost mean the same thing.	agent_1:I dont know how they differ, but I dont listen to either one. by the way, do you pay attention to politics?
101203	agent_2:I find is very silly that we no longer consider it a planet, It seems like we are always finding out new things about the planets in our immediate solar system, we will get to mars very soon I think. agent_1:Some of the larger moons were  considered planets at one time. agent_2:I feel like when we do get to mars, we may find signs of former life on that planet.	agent_1:Elon Musk is doing his best to find out, lol.  I think the moon Juno is interesting, and maybe hold life.
105468	agent_2:Yep, only 2 which is crazy. I'm thinking Darius Rucker will be in there. agent_1:I wonder if he plays the fender stratocaster, the guitar invented just for country music agent_2:Haha yea I wonder as well	agent_1:do you like country music?
124712	agent_1:I see, well I do have a car, I drive it every day, do you like to drive? agent_2:I also have a car. I drive it every day to work. In 2014 there were over one and a quarter billion cars. That's insane! agent_1:A quarter billion cars no kidding!!! I bet theres a half billion cars by now or even more.	agent_2:Yep that wouldn't surprise me. back in 1986 there only 500 million cars. the amount of cars is growing exponentially
46925	agent_1:That's pretty cool, Depp also adopted a horse from the film Sleepy Hollow so it wouldn't be put down agent_2:Oh that is so sweet, he is such a good person agent_1:Yea, Depp is also producing a biopic on Dr. Seuss too	agent_2:Yeah he is a great actor, musician ad a producer. Do you listen to country music?
86182	agent_2:Hahaha, you are so right, it does sound a little scary, but also Interesting. Imagine the value of a lion head Ivory. agent_1:Would you go in a cave like that? Still, I would start crying and screaming, even though the lion is dead. agent_2:I think I would, but only if I am touring with a large group of people, because who knows what may  be in that cave thousands of years. I wouldn't go by myself.	agent_1:Exactly! There should be a tour that would cost about $5 to $10 to walk in.
111617	"agent_2:Yes, if you watch footage of him, you can see him banging on strings with a coin! He was a genius. agent_1:Yes he is!  Did you know that Brian May also holds a PHD in astrophysics.  Crazy. agent_2:Brian ""the brain"" May is a genius. he should be in the rock hall of intelligence or something."	agent_1:lol That's great!  A guitarist for Pink Floyd turned a houseboat on the River Thames into a floating recording studio called the Astoria.  I bet that was neat recording on that.
80831	agent_1:The Oscars award show was nominated for emmys? agent_2:Yeah... John williams has been nominated a lot for his musical scores. He's done a ton! agent_1:Yea, he's done Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Harry Potter, to name a few.	agent_2:Seems like he's really talented... Ever wonder what it's like to be THAT talented? I can barely dress myself in the morning.
149391	agent_2:i never knew that. Truth is though, I've never really thought about it. I just kind of blindly accepted it as the color and never questioned it. agent_1:I noticed it but never gave any thought as to why it was blue.  lol agent_2:Did you know that facebook has 58 gender options?	agent_1:I didn't know that!  58?  lol
33796	agent_1:Yeah I think they have played over 2,000 shows! agent_2:That is basically a non stop tour for 20 years! Have you ever seen a Creed concert? agent_1:Yeah that is, crazy.  And no I haven't, have you?	agent_2:I never plan on it, especially since they were sued for playing a concert so badly in 2002 lol.
105327	agent_1:Yes, it's an interesting move that can be interpreted as playing to his base of Middle Americans when it's also honoring someone who bridged racial and cultural divides. agent_2:Yep I could see that. I think I should put Elvis on TV more, what about you? agent_1:Yes, especially his 1968 comeback special, which he used to speak out against injustice with his music. I'm sure his career would've played out differently in the age of the music video.	agent_2:Oh I definitely think so. I wonder if his videos were recorded in black and white or in color though? it's how TV started you know, in black and white
126276	agent_2:Yes, did you hear the one about a man who wore 70 clothing items in a Chinese airport to avoid the baggage charge?  Gee Wiz. agent_1:Ha ha he must have looked like a sumo wrestler. That's kind of dangerous though because layering clothes is what gangs did. agent_2:Wow, good to know.  Some people used to do their laundry in old Faithful, they put their clothes in the geyser and it would erupt with clean clothes. Sounds like an awesome way to do the laundry.	agent_1:Ha ha yes that would be epic! Somehow rip curl makes clothes in North Korea not sure how to get away with that.
107358	"agent_1:According to BBC News, it hasn't seemed to hurt him. Blom has no real health issues - only a slower gait and some trouble hearing.  agent_2:lol..maybe because he uses his own tabacco agent_1:LOL, maybe so.  It's pretty amazing.   France's Jeanne Louise Calment who holds the Guinness record for the ""oldest person ever."" The woman, from Arles in southern France, was 122 when she died in 1997."	agent_2:wow 122 years old!! Ive heard that Guinness World Records ask for a great deal of paperwork and proof to hold that title.
127936	agent_2:That is weird! Also weird that FDR spoke of foreign language and was the last president to do so agent_1:I see well enough of politics, what are your thoughs on Google? agent_2:Well I do like Google. I personally use being though haha. I have a Google phone. I guess you can zoom in to Google moon, which is like Google Earth but the moon, and originally if you zoomed in far enough it would have a picture of cheese haha	agent_1:Google has an interesting line of smartphones, a single Google search requires a lot of computing power, more than the power it took for the astronauts to get to the moon
28516	agent_1:Yeah, she is one my favorites.  I heard the LAPD asked her to tweet her 11.4 million followers some info about upcoming roadwork. agent_2:She was really persistent in order to gain fame.She performed at open mic nights and began acting in school plays as a teen. agent_1:Its nice to see someone's hard work pay off.  I hope she stays successful and happy for a long time to come.	agent_2:She is cool to her fans too. She once bought $1000 worth of pizza for waiting fans.
42814	agent_1:That is in part because Toyota owns 10% of Tesla agent_2:Seems like that relationship is backwards to me. agent_1:I would agree with that.  I would have thought it would be the other way around as well.	agent_2:All I know is that he is one of the wealthiest men on earth. Speaking of, did you know that the earth will soon be helium free.
106464	agent_1:Maybe she'll change her image... or maybe more ambitious music ? agent_2:Possibly, she is still young enough to do so. And she definitely has the vocals to make it work. agent_1:vocals and tech team to improve vocals digitally :)	agent_2:Yes, music is quite different now that technology is involved so much.
77748	"agent_2:I agree with you. I guess Americans call it soccer because that is slang for""association football""but I still don't know why it's called soccer, even knowing that LOL agent_1:lol right!  Do you like to travel? agent_2:I do like to travel. I travel a lot for work actually. What about you? We usually take an airplane or sometimes we drive in big trucks"	agent_1:Yes I lvoe to travel.  did you know the dutch are creating a commuter bus that travels like  mph?
125286	agent_2:I do. What do you like to watch? agent_1:Right now Arrow, The Flash and Supergirl, and also Lethal Weapon, what about you? agent_2:I missed some 'old' tv shows and have been watching The Office, Parks and Rec, and House recently. Also like the Simpsons	agent_1:Those are  really cool, I love the Simpsons, crazy how there's one episode without Bart in it, his like the star of the show
37945	agent_2:Wow, I bet. I'm not looking forward to the day when my kids have cell phones.  agent_1:Me neither!I am pretty fearful of the bullying they might get or give. Kids can be so mean! agent_2:Yes, they can be brutal. And you can try your best but your can't censor everything they will find a way. Did you know that FB has over 50 gender options?	agent_1:50! I know there is now some grey (non-binary) but 50! Not all men had the right to vote until 1918. I wonder who couldn't vote...
16822	agent_1:Yeah, I think it's because of his charisma, good timing, and viral videos of him defending progressive ideals and policies. Not sure what relentless shoe-leather politicking means though. agent_2:Yea I'm sure O'Rourke being an electric bassist in the 90s helped him seem more relatable agent_1:Yeah! He even toured the US and Canada with his punk rock band!	agent_2:Yea, Ted Cruz seems out of touch, especially tweeting a photo of O'rourke from when he was in the band
106258	agent_1:lol  Me too.  There is 3g cell service and internet capabilities at the peak of Mt. Everest.  That's amazing. agent_2:You know, so you can check in and Facebook your accomplishment.  LOL agent_1:lol That's funny!  Only 7 percent of people read the full terms when buying a product or service online.  Do you read the full terms?  I go over them but it looks like I'm in the minority.	agent_2:I vaguely do, so Ive probably agreed to some sketchy stuff not even knowing it.
35572	agent_2:I know, Psy's Gangnam style was so popular youtube had to upgrade their view count to 64 bits integers agent_1:i never saw that video. i think the song was used in a super bowl commercial. he got his 15 minutes of fame. agent_2:Yea, I wish Justin Bieber's fame would end, he has the most disliked video on youtube	agent_1:i wonder if people dislike the video or him. i dont know his songs, but i dislike him anyway.
135490	agent_2:Oh, I am sorry to hear that but that's cool you got to do that and that your team did well! I do like to watch baseball but mostly in person. I always wondered why baseball managers wear uniforms. Do you know why? agent_1:Yeah I guess technically they are able to take they field if needed!  Isn't that wild? agent_2:Awesome! Wonder if that has ever happened.	agent_1:I am trying to think if it ever did but I don't know, but that would be really cool if a team had to, and then he made a big play or something.  But, you figure if it did happen, they would've made a movie out of it.
124904	agent_2:And that's awful. They feel like they are also to blame and that's not right. Kids should be able to go to school and feel safe.  agent_1:I am glad they were able to arrest the Santa Fe suspect Dimitrios Pagourtzis. agent_2:Me too! It's crazy to think a kid can plan out horrible events. How did his parents not know he was keeping journals on his computer and cellphone. Those things should maybe be checked regularly. 	agent_1:Yes, it's horrible I have deep sympathy for his parents as well, though. I am glad he wasn't able to carry out his plans of suicide, as mentioned in his plans.
126175	agent_1:Correct. He had a $40 late fee for Apollo 13.  agent_2:Actually, I think it was a VHS copy, that was a long time ago! agent_1:It was VHS. Do you watch a lot of TV as well?	agent_2:Not too much. I like comedies though. What about you?
58693	agent_1:ya that is a nice thing, weird that almost 90% of nevada is owned by the US gov. agent_2:A man in France impersonated a government official, and managed to sell the Eiffel Tower. Maybe he could help the govât sell some of the land in the Nevada. agent_1:lol good idea, and he sold it not once but 2 times, how wild!	agent_2:I guess he was good at conning people. Did you hear that Wikileaks published the government's plans to destroy Wikileaks? Seems ironic.
144418	agent_2:Kareem abdul-jabbar used it and dominated basketball for a while. So they banned it. Apparently, that got over turned at some point. agent_1:I had no idea! Three of the five games between the Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers were decided by at least 19 points, and the average margin of victory was 15.2 points. agent_2:Yeah the points can get crazy. I don't watch it much. But, I do watch a lot of South Park.	agent_1:Is that still on? Reggie miller, nba hall of famer, couldn't escape his older sister cheryl's shadow while in high school. on january 26, 1982, he scored a career high 40 points. he tried bragging about it on the car ride home, only to find out cheryl scored 105 points and broken 8 national records!
149695	agent_2:Maybe not a lot,  maybe they retired from football after that defeat. agent_1:Oh, did they? Maybe if they had someone like Benjarvus Green Ellis on their team they would have done better. He hasn't fumbled the football in his nfl career. agent_2:Yeah Benjarvus was a great player I think he retired back in 2011 cant believe he never fumbled a ball though, he was a great RB	agent_1:Tom Brady is another great player. Yet, his high school football team refused to start him even though they were having a bad season!
101408	"agent_2:Here's hoping their brains don't get infected with that efail business. agent_1:LOL. Their brains are already infected. someone call 911, or 212 if its faster agent_2:What would you even tell the operator? ""Help, my friend's brain has a virus! ...no like, an email virus! ....yes really!!"""	agent_1:Ha! I guess people thought the same about readers at some point. IN the 18th century there was a moral panic because of the spread of reading novels.
110807	agent_2:I didn't realize that it had twin buildings until today. What I found interesting was the use of floppy disks, which I don't understand why they would still be using that source of technology. agent_1:No I don't get it either. Especially because the White House has solar panels on top. You think they'd be more technologically advance and use USB drives agent_2:I found it quite interesting that the president of Zimbabwe was called president banana. I don't even know why that would be an option for a name but it was something funny to think about. 	agent_1:No that's funny! Like, Is that his real name or something? I hope that he releases some pop albums like the president of Indonesia did. He could call it banana pop haha
93712	agent_2:Probably. So, get rid of your friends for a buck. agent_1:Do you like to read?  agent_2:I do like to read. You?	agent_1:yeah, have you ever read Starship troopers the book?
162561	agent_1:Yea each member definately The quarterback also touches the ball on almost every offensive play, and is the offensive player that almost always throws forward passes. So  agent_2:Did you know who Kyler Murray was before reading the article? I never heard of him. I am so out of touch with some things.  agent_1:Nope lol and I still am not sure, I did not read that part either. It has been good talking to you.	agent_2:I enjoyed taking to you and learning some sport trivia and facts.
49657	agent_1:I love comedy movies, how about you? agent_2:Good morning!  Comedy is one of my favorite genres of movies too.  What would be your favorite comedy movie? agent_1:Me too. I love me some Bill Murray, but Step Brothers is a classic!	agent_2:Yes - Bill Murray will go down as one of the best ever!  Step Brothers was great - Will Ferrell is right up there with BM, but has a long way to go!
5549	agent_1:Right! I don't even know how that would work. Very interesting though, also I read someone built a 16 bit computer using nothing but Minecraft building blocks, so crazy how these people get these idea's. agent_2:I know agent_1:So do you like the piano? 	agent_2:I accidentally hit the enter tab, I was going to say I know, the world is full with creativity, and I do like the piano I like the sound of it.
137689	agent_1:Oh did not know that, pretty cool .Do you know who invented it? agent_2:I do not know the name of the guy do you know who it was? agent_1:Yeah it was James Naismith, he was a coach at U of Kansas and the only losing coach in their history. 	agent_2:Wow that is very intriguing. Back to football, US has more than half of the largest stadiums in the world
82921	agent_2:Speaking of CEOs, it's surprising that Reed Hastings of Neflix started Netflix after racking up a $40 late fee on a video cassette copy of Apollo 13. agent_1:Wish I had his idea first!  If I would have been the first Amazon customer, I might have had a building named after me and been able to make some money.  The first amazon customer spent $27.95 and had a building name after him. agent_2:Have you ever gotten an Amazon package delivered on Sunday? Apparently you can as the USPS has a contract with Amazon to deliver packages on Sunday.	agent_1:I don't remember getting one on Sunday.  If you join Amazon Prime though, expect to spend twice the money on there that you normally would.  The average Prime customer spends $1300 per years as compared to $700 for non-Prime customers.
77557	agent_1:You would think so, but they could be easily tampered with, if they did. 34% of black males in Alabama permanently lost the right to vote. I wonder why?   agent_2:I suspect because they were convicted of a felony.  Not many people know that in England men couldn't vote until 1918 unless they were property owners.  WWI put an end to that. agent_1:34% felons? That doesn't sound right. I'll have to look it up. So WWI had some positive results, I see.	agent_2:That's actually a pretty common reason in a lot of states.  They are working to relax that in some places.  Our prisons are full of men (especially) who haven't got the right to vote.  During the 2012 elections in the US internatonal electoral of servers were blocked from the polls.
70281	agent_1:I enjoy South Park. I don't know if you are familiar with their Family Guy episode but when they aired it they received flowers from The Simpsons crew.  agent_2:I did not know that they sent flowers i did watch the episode hilarious as usual agent_1:It was a great episode and while I do like Family Guy I can't help but see the faults they pointed out when I see it now. Speaking of The Simpsons, did you know that there is only one episode ever where Bart neither appears or is mentioned? 	agent_2:I did not know that either i like learning facts about things it is interesting
108567	agent_2:Yes. Do you know what the first president of Zimbabwe was called? agent_1:Yes he was called President Banana agent_2:Yes. Did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house?	agent_1:I guess they get a lot of people there and need the room
67034	agent_1:Good point. A guy in france once managed to sell the eiffel tower twice	agent_2:He must have been good. Nice chat
112568	agent_1:Yeah I do too, I recently found a good local station that I like.  I listen when commuting as well.  agent_2:Do you prefer radio shows that talk about music, gossip, entertainment news or radio with strictly music or other radio shows that talk about sports, news, etc.? agent_1:I like music stations mostly, but I think that satellite radio offers a ton of good choices as well. 	agent_2:Yeah, I agree but in Canada, all radio stations are required to have at least 40% of the music played be canadian, I wonder what that means or whether or not it just means the artist has to be from Canada or something
136998	agent_1:I bet blockbuster regrets it now. agent_2:It's karma. The guy who started Netflix created the company because he got a $40 late fee. agent_1:I think that 40 bucks was worth it 	agent_2:Yeah. Now Netflix is 33% of late night Internet traffic.
125704	agent_1:the game is different in Japan but still a lot of fun. fans are passionate but well behaved. and the high school is a religion. anyway, great chat! agent_2:yes thank you for all the smiles!!!! agent_1:You're very welcome. Have a good night!	agent_2:you too
157639	agent_1:It seems like the main stream media and other people do not like certain figures, like Sarah Huckabee Sanders. She was shooed out of a restaurant by the owners. agent_2:Ya that is appalling.  Even if you disagree with someone you shouldn't scream at them. agent_1:Speaking of screaming, apparently Michael Moore recently attended an anti-trump rally, with Jeff Flake of all people.	agent_2:Does not surprise me.  They think they are American heroes, but the real heroes were the people who fought in WWII.  Apparently, soldiers made radios using razorblades and pencils!
68625	"agent_2:I think she went through a really hard time being a child celebrity so early and then she kind of evened out. I am not a fan of her music or acting but she's alright! Pretty nice now. What about you? agent_1:Yeah I think that she had to go a little crazy to shake the Disney brand. I like her. So Kennedy Holmes was only 13 years old? agent_2:Yeah! I looked her up on Youtube and she is so, so good! She sang Adele's ""Turning Tables"". Do you like Adele?"	agent_1:I don't know who Adele is. I have the feeling that I am somewhat older than you. Is Adele a current singer?
140744	agent_2:LOL I could only imagine!  Jann Mardenborough became a pro racer by beating 90,000 people in the video game Gran Turismo. agent_1:That's a good game, but I prefer Need for Speed. I love how adaptable McDonalds is. They came up with the drive-thru, due to soldiers not being permitted out of their cars while wearing fatigues. agent_2:Was that in 1975?	agent_1:I believe so. Are you a Simpsons fan? There is only one episode where there is no sign of Bart, not even his name is mentioned. Of course, I haven't seen it.
97599	agent_2:Now that I did know. Depending on what you're watching it can really get your heart going. I've always been scared of E.T. maybe because I was so young when I first saw it. It was originally intended to be a horror move, but to child me it was! agent_1:Danny the boy from the shining didnt even know he played in a horror until several years later. I think it has a lot to do with a persons mind state. agent_2:I'm sure they protected him on set as best they could. I can't imagine its easy for children to act in horror films. Or for their parents to watch them.	agent_1:Did you ever think bambi was a scary movie?
26922	agent_2:That is pretty wild, and i don't think that is relatively long in the grand scheme of humans, I do know we are adapted to be the best distance runners of all the animals as well.  agent_1:Yeah, and we are probably the only ones running for fun, if you can call it that.   You don't see many animals training for a marathon. agent_2:I would have to agree, never thought about that, I think we do lots of things for fun that most animals would never do. 	agent_1:Seems odd that humans like to swim, I guess we want to return to being fish.
78678	agent_1:I actually remember that and remember him for his hook shot.  In 39 out of 50 states the highest paid state employee is either a college basketball or football coach. agent_2:The inventor of basketball is the only losing coach for the University of Kansas agent_1:haha now that's irony there.  Out of the 30 teams in the NBA I think my favorite would have to be the Boston Celtics.	agent_2:lets talk about the NBA next, Nike paid fines every game for Micheal Jordan to be able to wear Air Jordan's
137180	agent_1:I didn't know that! They have so many interesting shows and movies, especially the original content you can't watch anywhere else! agent_2:Supposedly they got 150 movies that have a 100% rating on rotten tomatoes. agent_1:That's amazing! They've been making their own stuff since 2012, which I also didn't know until recently. 	agent_2:They've got odd standards though.  There are places in Europe where they monitor illegal downloads in order to decide which shows to buy.
98025	agent_1:Agreed on the voice, and yeah it was for spoken album, actually a recording of the audio of her book.  agent_2:Even though I'm not her biggest fan she did get my vote. Did you know astronauts vote from space?  agent_1:Yeah I think that is such an interesting fact.  I don't think they get bombarded as much with all of the ads during election time as well!	agent_2:Well they still probably get emails. The voting system is messed up Hilary actually got 65 million votes and still didn't win. That's actually the 3rd highest vote total ever.
124404	agent_2:Earth was formed over 4.5 billion years ago but humans are rapidly destroying it in no time. agent_1:It's interesting that jupiter has such strong storms they can be picked up by am radio on earth agent_2:Interesting. I don't know that I've ever heard those storms but maybe I just haven't been listening for them!	agent_1:lol yeah i've never heard them either but it's crazy what technology can do
149366	agent_2:Yes it is, and to be the leader of a lot of people you should be hiding nothing.  agent_1:I had dictators or authoritarian regimes, Trump is a bad leader but I guess we have it better than a lot of countries, hope he doesnt get re elected though agent_2:Oh yeah we for sure have it better than other countries but we should have it better than we do. 	agent_1:We should always try to improve, interesting fact but until 1805 the runner up of an election would become vice president
78399	agent_2:Trains are just as expensive. The freeways are fast. Still, Japan is not a car country like the US. agent_1:I know you're right. Mackinac island is also not a Car Country. They only allow horses on the island agent_2:That's great! They should ban phones too. Unplug from everything!	agent_1:that would be Really interesting. By the way do you use Amazon to order anything online?
39511	"agent_1:Well, only .53% of people going on Reddit actually vote.  That might skew what is thought as real or fake news.  It's so hard to tell, but must be some bias. agent_2:What is of real concern is the invasion of the ""bots"".  Did you know that there are more automated software programs (bots) on the internet than people.  So was that Reddit vote real or fake? agent_1:Who knows?  Am I talking to a bot now?  I can read a magazine People made based upon Reddit.  I'm hoping that real people would be writing People magazine haha"	agent_2:You never know?  I read an article about bots fighting over a Wiki page on Israel.  One would change Israel to Palestine and the other would change it back.  The page was always edited a few seconds ago.
49092	agent_2:Id believe it, that is when I tend to watch the most.  How about you? agent_1:Yes I probably watch mostly in that time frame. Netflix and YouTube combined also account for half of peak internet traffic in North America.  agent_2:That is pretty amazing.  I cant believe Blockbuster didn't take the chance to buy them	agent_1:Oh I heard about that. Weren't they offered a fairly cheap price to buy them?
72358	"agent_2:That's sweet!  Remember when he was in trouble with Australia for illegally bringing dogs across the border? agent_1:Yes, that was funny. Did you see his mea culpa video? He was with like the prime minister doing a PSA.  agent_2:I wonder what all the meetings were leading up to their final ""truce"". I wonder what his next project is going to be."	agent_1:I did not know he was doing a biopic on Dr Seuss.
75315	agent_1:Yeah, you should try it out if you have a son or a niece, nephew, its a book ages 5 to 8 so not the best book for an adult agent_2:I dont have any kids myself, but I do have tons of friends who have kids in that age range.  Ill suggest it to them.  How much do you know about cars? agent_1:I know the first model for mas production was the Ford T Model, it was produced back in the year 1908	agent_2:It is amazing how far cars have come,  it is even legal to put flamethrowers on your car in south Africa to prevent car jackings.
77283	agent_1:I wonder what kind of jazz they play. Do you have a favorite style of Jazz ? agent_2:I like the trumpeters. They only grow those goatees because it makes playing more comfortable. agent_1:Oh that makes sense, I like Bebop. It is like poetry, do you read poetry ?	agent_2:Not really.
81297	agent_2:Dogs are smart though.  They understand pointing.  Which is something only they and elephants can do. agent_1:that is an interesting fact. I think a lot of people think they are color blind, but really they don't see as many different colors as we do agent_2:I didn't know that.  I did know that they have 12 different blood types.  And there are dog blood drives.  	agent_1:wow so many interesting facts! I like playing catch with my dog with a soft baseball. Do you like baseball?
127564	agent_2:I did, and have seen it. It was a weird episode. Not as weird as the South Park family guy episode. agent_1:I never seen that one.  lol  Did they act like out Family Guy or something?  Do you watch youtube? agent_2:They roasted them terribly. Every now and again. I prefer Blutube, it's police videos.	agent_1:I've never seen it.  I'll have to look it up.  Youtube is the 2nd largest search engine on the net.
159766	agent_2:It could be that females just aren't really aware of that opportunity. They may just assume they can't. Especially with things happening like New Orleans Saints cheerleaders not being able to eat anywhere that any NFL player shows up at. Seems terribly sexist! agent_1:Agreed. I can't believe no lawsuits have been filed over that misogynistic rule yet. Unless it's just some silly superstition or something. But if they want a better paying job, females should just enter the engineering field since engineers make more than the average lifetime earnings of both MLB and NFL players anyway! agent_2:Ah, yeah! It could be that whole sports/superstition thing! I never thought of it that way!	agent_1:True! It could very well be! I mentioned engineers previously and on a related note, did you know the NFL has tracking chips they stick in the players' shoulder pads to record their every move? I think that's pretty innovative!
58650	agent_1:That is very true.  That includes me, lol. The main developer of Spotify also was the programmer that made Utorrent.  agent_2:That guy is probably quite rich by now. Are you a fan of fantasy novels? agent_1:Yes, I love them.  Big can of Fantasy and Sci Fi. Speaking of fantasy, you can actual do a fantasy draft of the National spelling bee.	agent_2:I wonder what the prize for winning the draft is.
132850	agent_2:I thought so too.  Also, Jon Hamm taught drama at his old high school and one of his students was Elle Kemper, Erin from the Office.  agent_1:I did not know that.  Erin was funny in the Office.  Is the Office still around? agent_2:I am not a big fan of the Office so I don't know.  I like comedy but I especially liked 3rd Rock from the Sun where they won the Golden Globe for best comedy series in 1997 beating Seinfeld, Friends, and Frasier.	agent_1:I like Frasier and Seinfeld.  I especially liked Seinfeld and I watched their reruns over and over again. I was surprised about the 3rd rock winning the golden globe.
78546	agent_2:It has profile pictures that are scrambled images the app sets people up blindly based on when you say you would b somewhere. agent_1:Wow technology is both fascinating and dangerous! Netflix spend 20 times more on postage than bandwidth.  agent_2:That is pretty crazy to thing about especially how much people watch Netflix.  It and Youtube account for loads of bandwith between 9p-12a,	agent_1:Yeah about 33% right, in the entire north american area?
41125	agent_1:They are really cool. They have 12 different blood types. agent_2:Haha that is funny I didn't know dogs had blood drives! agent_1:Did you know Istanbul has vending machines that dispense food and water to stray dogs in exchange for plastic bottles?	agent_2:So cool. If the vending machine is colored the dogs would be able to see it because they aren't color blind!
104362	agent_1:That's so weird! I bet they were sorry they got rid of him! agent_2:Yeah and for only a buck, someone got fired for sure lol, you know that players lose up to 8 punds in a single game I might start playing hockey lol . agent_1:That sounds like a brutal diet! lol. I've been to concerts at the stadium where our team plays and often wonders what they do with the rink when they're not using it.	agent_2:I think that ice rings become basketball courts when there's no hockey
43337	agent_1:I know . did you hear about that judge in Michigan? agent_2:Was that judge's name Tupac? That would be a heck of a coincidence.  agent_1:No I do not think so. Have you heard of compliment battle?	agent_2:Uh, no. Not much of a battle, if you ask me. How do they determine the winner? The more gracious person?
10512	agent_1:Have you heard of Roger Federer? agent_2:Roger Federer is Swiss professional tennis player the world no. 1 position in ATP ranking records for 310 weeks. agent_1:He also along with two other men has accounted for 56% of grand slam titles.	"agent_2:He also won the ""BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the year"" award for four times. For his excellent performance and hardwork."
93764	agent_1:Yeah it is amazing, Detroit was named for French Explorer Antoine De La Mothe. They have made so many cars since being founded.  agent_2:YEs, about card, did you know in South Africa is ok to install flame-throwers in your car? agent_1:That is wild. I bet nobody messes with them!	agent_2:Yes I bet is pretty good to prevent car jacking!
38882	agent_1:I had no idea that Taylor Swift and Katy Perry had beef, but I'm glad they're ending it. agent_2:I think its a good thing, better to be friends but I wonder if the whole fight between them was staged? agent_1:It might have been. It's no coincidence that everything was brought to light the same night Katy Perry's album dropped and when Taylor Swift released all her music for streaming. Headlines always seem to sell.	agent_2:I agree, it does seem suspicious, I heard that Swift  posted a post of an olive branch  hours before a concert of the Reputation Tour
161745	agent_2:I don't think radio technology has improved that much as far as amplitude. AM/FM stations still have really short range. A modest car trip and the local stations are already out of range. agent_1:At the same time, we can pick up radio storms from Jupiter, they are strong enough. agent_2:Oh right I have heard of people who do that. I think maybe it's because the transmitters only send the radio waves short wave, where as the radio storms on jupiter are naturally occurring and everything there is massive.	agent_1:That makes sense. All I know is I don't think radio is enticing enough to pay money for. I go to a website that has thousands of free radio dramas.
154528	agent_1:Wow, that would cause anarchy!   agent_2:No kidding! But then again, back in 2012, international electoral observers were blocked from the polls in 9 states during the election. I'm really surprised that didn't stir anything up! agent_1:Yea, imagine if that was the 2016 election.  Things have changed so much.  Now we can do everything from our phones, but in WW2 soldiers were making radios out of razorblades and pencils!	agent_2:Did they really? Well speaking of radios, I sometimes like to break out the old AM radio and listen to those Jupiter radio storms. It is fascinating to hear!
107980	agent_1:Wow, that is so crazy, I know Bush and Gore were the last ones, do you know any others? agent_2:I'm not sure who they were. In Guatemala close relatives  of former presidents cannot legally run for president. What do you think about that? agent_1:I think that would have screwed up the Bush dynasty lol. That is interesting. I wonder if Guatemala's presidents guest house is bigger than their actual house like the US	agent_2:Yeah, I wonder. How long has the white house been around? Was it there in Lincoln's time? He was the first president to have his photo taken at inauguration and John Wilkes Booth was in that photo.
60145	agent_1:thats right!  Reading is a means for language acquisition, communication, and sharing information and ideas. agent_2:I always thought speed reading was fascinating.  Did you know the speed reading record is 4,700 words per minute! agent_1:I don't know how you can comprehend what you read at that speed!	agent_2:I don't know.  But reading is so complex and everyone has their own interpretation of what they read which I think is why reading is so great.
161691	agent_1:yea i was thinking that also, kind of sad to think that but that is our history. I have never seen the guest house, i may have to google it. Have you seen it? agent_2:I have not. I want to google it too. That and the replicas of the white house in france and england. agent_1:for sure, i may want to check those out sometime in my life. Did you know that the government owns 86% of nevada	agent_2:AREA 51! Just kidding, I do not believe in that. Like I would not believe someone trying to sell me the Eiffel Tower.
11190	agent_1:Id be claiming that as my desk!  I heard all the candy is made in PA agent_2:Yes, I bet it helps keep their sugar levels up while making important decisions.  agent_1:When the actually do that.  It seems like they are always out and rarely in session	agent_2:lol, yes. I'm surprised it wasn't until 1993 that women could wear pants on the senate floor!
18410	"agent_1:No, that's pretty cool, so is Michigan State University largest publicly available comic book collection agent_2:I would say most collectors dont want just anybody touching their comics. Lol. agent_1:No I wouldn't lol. It pretty cool that marvel was able to trademark ""super-hero"" and ""super-villain"""	agent_2:Dc comics stands for Detectice Comics which is redundant. Its Detetictive comcs comics
40697	agent_2:Yes, all kinds. You? agent_1:I like jazz, but recently trying out rapping agent_2:Jay-Z is one of the most acclaimed rappers; married to Beyonce. Do you know him?	agent_1:I have heard of him, but am not too familiar
137619	agent_1:What type of entertainment do you enjoy? agent_2:Hi, I enjoy quite a few different things. Tops on my list is probably video games. I read that in total the planet plays about 3 billion hours of video games a week. agent_1:It is interesting how games can produces 2D and 3D images to create worlds within a flat screen	agent_2:Yes. Technology has greatly improved video games making them more and more addictive. Did you know in South Korea it's illegal for kids 16 and under to play after midnight? Not sure how they enforce that. I never would have made it as a kid there.
37710	agent_2:absolutely! agent_1:Me too, do you like the new ones or the old ones better? agent_2:Old ones!  I was 7 when the first one came out in 1977.	agent_1:wow, i wasn't even a thought yet during that but I love them still! Lucas became a billionaire because of those!
125205	"agent_2:Ahh that would definitely explain it, regardless I prefer other forms of radio. There's a website I like that lets you listen to thousands of radio dramas for free. agent_1:I did not know that.  I would like to listen to them - I like the word ""free"" too. agent_2:Ahah well then maybe you'd like ""Nuntii Latini"". It's a free news program broadcasted by a Finnish radio station, it's interesting because it's conducted entirely in classical Latin."	agent_1:I like free programs, but in Latin?  I do not think so.  It is a difficult language.
98473	agent_1:Interesting. Apparently there is a basketball court on top of the supreme court.  agent_2:Highest court in the land... I wonder if that is where they deliberate? agent_1:Hilarious, well at least there are more libraries in the US than McDonalds. 	agent_2:Sure. That is where I read that eating McDonalds is bad for you.  I also read that at the Burger King drive thru. Do you have a library card? Supposedly half of adults do..
86126	agent_1:LOL that's hilarious! Did you know Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that's topping the charts? agent_2:I did not know that! I wonder what they sound like! And if they've ever stopped by that apartment in Harlem where the woman has held free jazz concerts every Sunday for 20 years. Seems like a lot of top performers occasionally stop by so this could be their venue! agent_1:That's pretty cool. Jazz musicians grow goatees to provide comfort when playing.	agent_2:I did not know that but that explains a lot about jazz musicians I've seen. I'm really into the blues but recently found out that
146538	agent_1:How's it going, Do you watch football much? Alex Smith of the Redskins is good at avoiding turnovers agent_2:I don't follow football much. Who is Alex Smith? agent_1:He is a QB for the washington Redskins who replaced Kirk Cousins when he left	agent_2:Ok, don't really not the Redskins. I guess this guy is a phenom or something?
86442	"agent_2:That's funny lol....Do you ever listen to Jazz music? agent_1:I do love jazz... Did you know jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and developed from roots in blues and ragtime.  agent_2:That is interesting! Did you know Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as ""one of America's original art forms""......very cool!"	agent_1:There is a programming language in which the programs are written in musical composition, and functional programs have jazz-like harmonies.
16254	agent_2:Speaking of humor, I always enjoyed Mark Twain's humor. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn had some funny moments in it! agent_1:Yes it did. Did you know Nikola Tesla and Mark Twain were best friends?  agent_2:Really? That is so cool. I did not know that actually? I do know Edison filmed the only footage on record of Twain. I've always wanted to see it. Would be cool if he had footage of Tesla and Twain together!	agent_1:That would be cool. Did you know Thomas Edison filmed the only known footage of Mark Twain?
45413	agent_1:Pretty expensive -- there are more games but in smaller arenas. The nosebleed seats aren't too bad. agent_2:I wouldn't have a good time at basketball too many people to follow.  I much prefer baseball agent_1:Baseball is much more affordable for fans. There isn't the same sort of big name players like basketball. Like a LeBron James of MLB.	agent_2:That's true, even I know who LeBron is.    Do you have a favorite basketball player?
110221	agent_1:It definitely is. Did you know that the 3 line menu on apps and websites is called a hamburger button? So strange.  agent_2:Some developers love the hamburger 3 line menu icon because it enables them to pack more features into apps or navigation. Thank you very much.  agent_1:That is interesting. 	agent_2:Nice to chat with you. Thank you very much.
127594	agent_2:US is the rare country in the world that allows buying guns agent_1:Yea I think the United States should look for solutions since anyone can buy guns even people with mental problems. agent_2:this is inhumane.  Too many innocent people lost their lives because of this controllable issue	agent_1:Yea an example of that is the country music concert where the guy killed over 50 people.
106085	"agent_2:Hello, I am well thank you. How are you? What do you do for fun? agent_1:I am well. I have two kids so I do not have a ton of free time. I do find time to work out though. I have to do it from 430 - 615 am. agent_2:I hear ya, I have three kiddos. My ""free time"" is before they wake up or after bedtime. I usually watch TV, or movies search through social media on my phone. Try to relax."	agent_1:I usually end up doing that with them at night. If I am not careful, my entire free time can be spent watching TV. I really try to be productive, like doing MTurks while watching tv. How old are yours?
728	agent_1:I think it would be pretty cool. Do you play minecraft?  agent_2:I have in the past. Kind of amazing someone built a working computer using only the mine craft building blocks. agent_1:Yeah, that is pretty crazy. I'm not even sure how that is possible? 	agent_2:Me neither. I also don't know how the space shuttles general-purpose computer runs on 1 Mb of RAM.
30327	agent_2:Yeah I thought he was the highest paid player in the team, he helped the team return to the NBA finals and won two titles, that is impressive, he should earn a lot more money agent_1:ya I agree, did you know that one time he was playing and the other team put two players on him at all times, he couldn't score but his team still won, that shows you how much of a threat he is agent_2:That was an epic move. He is the greatest threat the team has. I want to watch that game already!	agent_1:haha totally! what do you think about lebron james? I think he's great, its wild that he was born in the same city as Curry too!
80921	agent_2:That is crazy! Have you ever been to iceland? agent_1:I haven't, but it looks pretty awesome. I hear they have no public rail system though, bummer. agent_2:I know. No public rail service which means more people take domestic flights. 	agent_1:There is an island without any motorized vehicles. Sounds peaceful.
12354	agent_2:That would be awesome to breathe underwater. That's hilarious for something that might not even exist.  agent_1:Yes I think so too. And this happened all in 1912! Well it was great chatting with you. agent_2:Animals are pretty fascinating to study. It was good chatting with you too!	agent_1:Have a good one!
58105	agent_2:I know of him but haven't listened to his songs, do you have any recommendations? agent_1:I am not too big of a fan but I read that he voiced the reptar wagon in the 1998 rugrats movie agent_2:haha ah ya I have to check that, do you know that the worlds fastest rapper can do about 14 syllables per second?	agent_1:Wow, that is crazy fast. Have you heard of compliment battel?
41174	agent_2:Yeah so that was genius od McDonald's to accommodate that in 1975 agent_1:Yeah good for everyone involved. Do you know who the trunk of the car is called as such? agent_2:Yeah because the old cars had wooden trunks, pretty cool	agent_1:Yeah. Do you know who cadillac is named after?
86942	agent_1:Do you like to read? agent_2:i do.. big into storys that hold deep connections to the way we live in the world as well as sharing information. INto sci fi? agent_1:That's cool!  I am not much of a reader at all, but i do like scifi!	agent_2:I found it interesting just to know that starship troopers  the book was on the reading list of branches in the military
134425	agent_2:I have taken a few courses in politics and happen to work in local politics. On a national level I do follow a lot of things but there are some things that I don't know much about. How about you? agent_1:Yeah I try to keep up . Did you know the president of indonesia is a pop star? agent_2:I did not, I don't know a lot about most of the foreign leaders except for those that regularly are shown in the news here in America.	agent_1:Oh I see. DO you know who the wealthies US presidnet are?
86466	agent_2:Wow, didn't know she won a grammy.  Wondering if she had an accent.  Vaguely recall her adopting a southern drawl when she was campaigning in the southern states. agent_1:How cool. And to think she was a president of Young Republicans in college.  agent_2:That's pretty surprising.  Can't picture her as anything but a democrat.   I mean she's had so many roles in her lifetime.  Politician, diplomat, writer.  Am I missing anything from her resumer?	agent_1:Yes true, she is very accomplished. She even worked with Stephen Hawking and her husband when he lectured at the white house.
147642	agent_2:I hear there is a replica of the white house in atlanta which is built as a private home.  agent_1:The White House also has two twin buildings so the one in Atlanta isn't the only one.  agent_2:Right,  cant remember where they are, do you remember?	agent_1:One is located in Ireland and the other one in France, they must be amazing but not as awesome as the original one
48144	agent_1:It probably has.  The Greeks say there are two masks associated with drama and they are comedy and tragedy. agent_2:That is some contrast there.  Do you know there is a website where you can listen to tons of old radio dramas for free? agent_1:No I didn't know that but i would like to find out more about it.  I know from watching old movies that there are some good radio dramas out there.	agent_2:Yeah I think there would be so many old gems in that pile of dramas that they have available.
39230	agent_2:Even so, jazz has a strong following with well known celebrities like clint eastwood being a lifelong jazz enthusiast agent_1:New Orleans jazz started in the early 1910s. I feel like it has a lot in common with the advent of rap... agent_2:I feel rap would be most similar to Bebop which shifted jazz towards a more challenging musician's music	agent_1:Yes, in terms of music but in terms of american cultural acceptance, I see more parallels with rap.
123064	agent_2:Oh yeah, that's more my speed! I can't believe that's been going on in Michigan for over one hundred years! agent_1:That's really neat though. It shows respect for tradition instead of just trying to make everything bigger and faster like with some mass transit systems.  agent_2:Iceland also doesn't have a public rail service.	agent_1:I could see why they wouldn't need one. They have quite a few flights between most towns and travel that way. I don't think most of them have cars either.
35229	agent_1:i know that he composes music as well, soundtracks and stuff. agent_2:He is very talented. Just like the jazz orchestra in Pakistan. They are at the top of the charts. agent_1:That is amazing. i guess there are lots of jazz fans in pakistan. i would not have expected that.	agent_2:I assume their trumpeters all have goatees. It provides comfort.
22670	agent_1:Yeah, I think with voice acting roles, celebrities start to connect to the audience better - like they are just everyday people. agent_2:They do connect better then.  Do you know how much judge judy makes per episode on her show? agent_1:Probably a ton! She's one of the highest paid celebrities in the world!	agent_2:I guess she gets paid $123,000 per episode!  That is crazy to me.
26810	agent_1:Yes, apparently there a lot of species that have lost the ability to fly, if they ever had it at all. Like everyone's favorite bird, penguins. agent_2:The flightless birds have a different digestive and respiratory systems than their flying cousins. agent_1:Probably due to what they eat. Change happens slowly over thousands of decades. Maybe in the future humans will be able to fly.	agent_2:Maybe. I just learned that we can regrow a rib. Somehow that escaped me.
126704	agent_2:That really gets my goat!  ha ha ha.  That is so cute.  I wonder if Google did that to make themselves seem more personable, quirky, friendly...something like that.  agent_1:Yes I would like to know about the reasoning as well. In 2013 Google went down for about five minutes and took 40% of web traffic with it. That goes to show how many people use Google. agent_2:Yes, it is scarily ubiquitous, and I do have many privacy concerns.  Alphabet, it's owner, is such a huge corporate conglomerate, with Sundar Pichai heading it up.	agent_1:Yes I am concerned about privacy as well. Google has a lot of power. When there is a disputed border, Google maps tailors its maps to the claim of each country where the Internet browser is located.
10928	agent_1:and that way they won't be scared so much. i think it would be good. agent_2:Have you ever heard that it is not legal to own pets in boulder, CO? You can be their guardian though, whatever that means! agent_1:oh wow that's odd. i wish i could have studied zoology more in college!	agent_2:Me too! Also Theodore roosevelt had a ton of pets like a bear and a hyena
15988	agent_2:i watch mostly people cooking and organizing.. it makes time pass agent_1:Yeah i generally get music from there but if i'm stuck on something like fixing my car or computer then it's good to have.  agent_2:i agree, i was able to learn alot of things through youtube, its very helpful at times. did you here about the momo challenge? 	agent_1:No i didn't, what's that?
139471	agent_1:Hello, do you like dogs? agent_2:Hey there I love dogs, what about you? agent_1:Me too I love them. id you know they have 12 types of blood	agent_2:No I didn't know that. But I hope that they have dog blood drives! And I also hope the dogs get a cookie afterwards haha
157136	agent_2:I have not listen to it, and probably won't.. Have you seen the super extra big flags that are used at football stadiums? agent_1:Yes. is there anything special about them? agent_2:They are expensive .. about $50,000.. do you know aproximately how much they weight?	agent_1:Considering their size maybe 100 lb?
78000	agent_1:No not really, 13 year olds are allowed to have an account so I disagree agent_2:My 16 year old son said nobody that age is on FB now.  agent_1:I guess most of them use Instagram do kids use Myspace anymore? you should ask him that	agent_2:They use Instagram, I told him Facebook owns Instagram
19700	agent_1:I bet, I think it is like 180 calories per movie. I can watch 10 per day and get rock hard abs soon agent_2:As long as you don't use them to chop up victims! Some horror film plots seem predictable, almost silly. People do laugh at horror films, don't they? agent_1:lol I won't, just for the beach! They all seem predictable lol, you can yell dont go into the room in almost every one!	agent_2:Of course, yet I bet the characters always do. It's the violence - and the unexpected shocks - that I don't enjoy.  What's the scariest movie you ever saw?
118138	agent_1:no that is crazy, did you know that women weren't allowed to wear pants in the senate until 1993? agent_2:1993?! That's way too late. That's upsetting. They always have a hard time modernizing it seems.  agent_1:yes that is true, I guess a bunch of female senators did a protest in 1993 by wearing pantsuits which were supposedly off limits haha	agent_2:I do not blame them. Did you know that the senate has a candy desk?
147700	agent_2:I have watched some  agent_1:Did you ever watch House MD? agent_2:I have see some episodes I like Greys Anatomy better	agent_1:Oh I see. Hugh Laurie though made a lot of money off of that show, $700 000 per episode
108862	"agent_1:its a class A mishap which can be the total destruction of the plane... $100 million in a pile of twisted metal. it seems such a waste agent_2:At least he wasn't the airline exec who was shot in the streets of of Memphis... Man, that's sad. Seemed like a good dude. agent_1:i wonder what the potential ""personal vendetta"" could be?"	agent_2:Right? I cannot imagine having a strong enough vendetta to harm someone maybe put a dead fish in their car.
137299	agent_1:Batting, running, fielding, scoring... Sounds like such an action-filled game. Then why is that that every time I watch, there is an old guy wearing a costume like all the kids? Is he the manager or the coach?  agent_2:It's the manager. He wears the uniform because technically he is eligible to play for the team should the need arise.  agent_1:It reminds me of my child's kickball games, except with a smaller ball. I guess in Canada they call kickball soccer-baseball.	agent_2:That's a mouthful. I like kickball better. Did you hear about that man that found baseball cards in his grandfather's attic?
112046	agent_2:He first accepted the dismissal, then fought back.  I know that a Jesuit Priest is one of the last people I would want to fight a battle of wits with. agent_1:Yeah. When you take a vow of poverty, you are committed.  It's no joke. agent_2:Also, if you haven't given some kind of performance review, which it seems they didn't, then you can's expect an employee to change since they don't know what you want.	agent_1:Exactly. You couldn't do that with a regular employee, much less a long term chaplin. I wonder if Conroy is one of the order who Millenials would call hypocritical and right wing? I don't know a lot about him.
133763	agent_2:I agree, it seems unfair that those doing the most work get the least out of it, whereas the coaches get millions. agent_1:Yeah, and if they get injured playing in college they don't get to go pro. It's a total scam.  agent_2:I've heard they lose scholarships if they are hurt during their school time, they have to be playing to get them.  It's a system ripe for abuse.	agent_1:Exactly, that's why I think they should be paid. The school's are making boatloads on them.
16662	agent_2:It is very interesting to know it. I think you read comic books. Who is your superhero ? agent_1:I like Superman. But Spiderman is cool too. I would love to see the Broadway musical about Spiderman. It was the most expensive production in Broadway history. agent_2:Music also plays an important role in superhero movies.  Graphic designers have an important job too.	agent_1:Yes you are right. Did you know Stan Lee's wife voiced Madame Web in the 1994 spiderman series?
110938	agent_1:Yeah me too for sure. do you know who pioneered the use of wide-lenses? agent_2:James Wong Howe of course! Oscar-winning cinematographer if I recall correctly.  Was he American? agent_1:He was Chinese-American. The guy went through so much. Because he married a white woman his marriage was illegal until 1948 due to racism.	agent_2:Sounds like a good movie script.  Did  you know that cinematographer Roger Deakins has been nominated 13 times and yet has never won? What, are there like only four cinematographers in all of Hollywood?
74058	agent_2:I think they have 3g service. It will be enough to load a picture or two on instagram when you reach the peak lol agent_1:Which is what counts!! In case the internet burns down there is a saved copy at the current library of alexandria. Not sure how that works! agent_2:I don't either. I hope they have a back up to the back up, just in case! It was so nice chatting with you!	agent_1:Me too! We need to save that hamburger button on the apps! Have a great night great chatting with you as well.
113386	agent_1:Probably.  I read about south park producers who received flowers from the simpson crew?  What was the reason? agent_2:Good question... I don't know. DId it have anything to do with the episode whre Daniel Radcliffe voiced a paraody of Twighlight's Edward Cullen?  I think the episode was Treehouse of Horro. agent_1:What other topics would you be interested in chatting?  I do not watch television, that is sometimes shortened to telly, any longer.	agent_2:How about Shakespeare? The only one of his plays not adapted to TV or film was The Two Noble Kinsmen. Know anything about that?  Shame yo don't watch TV. You miss the cultural advantages of being exposed to the likes of Monty Python..
53914	agent_1:No-I don't like Netflix and they take up so much band width during peak hours that I had to buy a booster for my wi-fi. agent_2:I know that netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in north america... from 9 pm to 12 am.  Thats a fun statistic to throw out at parties.  agent_1:Blockbuster didn't want to buy Netflix-they made a big mistake. Now there is no more Blockbuster and Netflix is worth 2 billion.	agent_2:It is an amazing instance of a company making a wrong move.  I wonder if Netflix is wrong to sink money into original content. 2 billion dollars in 2018.  Sounds like a lot.
118238	agent_2:No, and that's not even all, there is going to be 12 inches of rain agent_1:Not sure what's worse a storm or an erupting volcano.  Did you hear about the evacuations in Hawaii? agent_2:Yea, all the lava ended up destroying residential property	agent_1:Never really thought about toxic gas being an associated hazard.  Man FEMA there must have their hands full.
92699	agent_1:Haha...yes, John Lennon got into music for the same reason. Speaking of Mad Men and the John Ham Character, did you see where early on when he taught drama in high school he had Ellie Kemper, Erinn from The Office. That was a high powered acting high school, I wonder what they preformed? agent_2:Your right, i'd like to know myself. You know for a time Mackinac Island in MI banned motorized vehicles for over a hundred years? agent_1:I think Catalina Island off the coast of California is like that too, but I didn't know about Mackinac Island having that rule too. Probably a sleepy, laid back atmosphere, unlike Vegas. I see where Jim Carrey doesn't make dramas anymore because they're not positive enough for his karma, that a rich man's problem. Most of us have to work for a living and can't refuse like that, a little ironic to me.	agent_2:Me too and i didn't know that about Cali. However i just remembered that kings name that traveled around the world it was King Kalakaua.
143713	agent_1:I was a huge fan of that show too. There is only one episode of the Simpsons in which Bart does not appear in. agent_2:Oh the Simpsons, I really loved that show (until season 12 or so) and I don't think I have seen that one to be honest.  agent_1:The Simpsons is awesome. I heard that show has been going on for like 30 years now. 	agent_2:Yeah it sure has, the first 10 seasons are some of the best television that has ever been aired in my opinion.
129056	agent_2:Yes well it is definitely different than American football!  We definitely score more - one team won 222-0! agent_1:Well, right, but soccer is called football everywhere else. I wonder why we changed the name. agent_2:I am not sure.  Rugby football is another type of football as well	agent_1:I wish we could go back to a time where bowling was more lucrative than football. I would be all about that!
95094	agent_2:ya she gave the verdict ind the form of a rap, sounds like she has way too much time on her hands haha agent_1:It was probably the worst! I would have prefered jail than some judge rapping to me. agent_2:ha I agree, do you watch any television at all?	agent_1:Yes, far too much. What about you?
71644	agent_2:I was not aware that they also own IMDB. My son has an IMDB as I am sure every aspiring actor does. They are to retailing what Microsoft is to tech. agent_1:I also did not know Amazon had acquired IMDB, that is interesting. I wonder where the clock that Jeff Bezos built into the mountain is located. That must be really cool to see.  agent_2:I was thinking the same thing! I think he is a bit scattered lately. He and his wife is divorcing and he bought the washington Post. Newspapers are dying! Any way funny that this all started with books. Did you know that the record for speed reading is 4700 words per minute?	agent_1:So interesting! No I did not know that was the speed reading record- that is very fast! I don't think I'd be a good consumer of literature if I attempted speed reading! It's interesting to think of consumers of literature as creating visual images that make sense to them in the unfamiliar places the texts describe.
98073	agent_1:Maybe that has changed though,  we have a new President who is pretty wealthy! agent_2:Yea I forgot about that for some reason. The first president of Zimbabwe was called President Banana, I wonder how wealthy he was agent_1:President banana,  thats amazing. 	agent_2:I don't know if it's more amazing than the president of indonesia releasing 3 pop albums though
155809	"agent_2:I like that movie too!  Ha, ""Mission Impossible"" is what I'd call the next 2 years of Trump's presidency.  It'll impossible for me not to get irritated!  What other movies do you like? agent_1:I like day after tomorrow movie. Because it was awesome movie. agent_2:Ah, a disaster movie.  Never realized how many connections to Trump you could make off of movies.  I personally think his administration is a DISASTER.  Ha ha!  Think it's often times stranger than fiction.  Aren't there some action movies about the white house as well?"	agent_1:Okay. You like action movies?
38184	agent_1:Do you have any pets? They are good for companionship, company, and protection. agent_2:We have a bunch of animals in the house, a dog, couple of rabbits and fish.  No cats though. agent_1:What a full house! Some people have odd choices for pets like crabs and tarantulas.	agent_2:My daughter came home one day and said she wanted a snake for a pet, that's how we ended up with rabbits, it was a compromise.
135458	agent_1:Good morning. Are you a House fan? Hugh Laurie made 700K per episode. agent_2:Yeah I watch sometimes. That's a crazy amount of money. agent_1:Yeah, it is. Weird how Michael Caine only became an actor, because all the pretty girls were in drama.	agent_2:That sounds like a pretty good reason to me. I read that Jon Hamm used to teach drama at his high school.
15399	"agent_2:I didn't know that.  I wonder why. There is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet.  It is the Hudson Bay region of Canada. agent_1:I wonder how much affect that has? Is it enough to change weights in any way? I wonder. I do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century.  agent_2:Really, I hope that is ok for us?  I'm also a big tech guy, how about you?  Did you know new Google employees are called ""nooglers""."	agent_1:I did not. What a silly name ha ha.
143673	"agent_1:Comedy and comedians are weird. Did you know that Bill Murray considers ""Kung Fu Hustle"" the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy? agent_2:I didn't know that.  Bill Murray is funny but I wouldn't consider him the best at comedy. agent_1:He reminds me a bit of Jack Black, who was originally supposed to star in the Green Lantern movie, which was supposed to be a comedy! It's sort of how Murray did Garfield. Weird fit..."	agent_2:I guess the Green Lantern could be a comedy.  Oddly enough on Murray, he does some serious roles really well!
157886	agent_2:Hi im doing good.  how are you?  Yeah I listen to it sometimes.  agent_1:I used to listen to the radio when i was younger. i dont listen much now. agent_2:Oh I see,  did you ever listen to jupiters storms?  	agent_1:I never have. is that what the kids are into these days? i guess i am getting old.
71493	agent_1:For sure for sure. You listen to a lot of music by chance too? Either in person at a concert or download and buy albums? agent_2:I actually love the album Hybrid Theory by Linkin Park! In fact, it is the best selling album of the 21st century and I can see why because it's so amazing! What about you? agent_1:It's a fun album, I definitely listened to it a lot in the mid 2000s, I think that is when it first came out. NWA was a great group too, the movie was really good.	agent_2:Agreed. Did you also know Straight Out Of Compton was the first album to hit platinum status despite no airplay support or major tours? That is really impressive!
120656	agent_1:They would likely be surprised in the direction the country has gone.  Some of how people choose to interpret things today agent_2:I'll bet. Of course, money did help buy them power, and some of that $$$ came from slave ownership. Ever think we're heading toward a one-party state? agent_1:No, I always think there will be that huge division.  There are so many polarizing topics.	agent_2:What about the x-factor, the internet, and its power in the 21st century? Good? Bad?
52738	agent_2:It would seem to be expensive too if you have to buy that many shoes. I wonder it they are expensive to buy? agent_1:they must be, I also did not know Bruce Lee was a champion dancer agent_2:And the cha-cha at that! Out of all the dances in the world, he must have really liked the beat.	agent_1:I wonder if he moved really fast
83664	agent_1:They are and it is a category that newer companies have done well at so it is surprising that they are not too stodgy to stay in the gaming game. agent_2:Also admire the generosity of Microsoft's founder, Bill Gates. His foundation is using profits to provide medical aid and other services worldwide. agent_1:I am aware that they do that.  It is unlike Warren Buffet who is waiting until he dies to give substantially to charity.  For a while, the Army used Xbox controllers to fly unmanned airborne vehicles.	"agent_2:I've heard about Army Xbox use. Hey, those young recruits are certainly familiar with an Xbox. So ""uav"" means - what you said. Thanks! I picture very small spy drones. Is that off the mark?"
91914	agent_1:That sounds so painful! Bruce Lee was also a great dancer. I guess that makes sense! agent_2:its wild that they have a hong kong cha cha championship (that is fun to say!) but I guess the cha cha was a lot more popular in the late 50s. I wonder if I can find a picture of it on the internet. Its great that we have that resource these days. agent_1:Interesting! Do you like hip hop dance? And what about rap music?	agent_2:I dont dance myself but I like to watch it. I like some rap music, it depends. the language towards minorities sometimes gets me. but I love how clever it can be with words and imagery. I love listening to tupac for that reason. but I also sometimes dont love tupac because of his language towards women and nonstraight identifying people
9934	"agent_1:It must be on the lease of the neighbors, ""must love jazz"". And ""not be afraid of people with goatee"".  agent_2:Lol, good call!  Yeah I was very surprised to read that those goatees started as a functional thing, not just looking cool.  agent_1:I wonder how they found this, was it a guy who had already a goatee and did not complain or a guy that complained a lot and grew a goatee in last resort. "	agent_2:Lol, hey that's like the chicken and the egg thing.  Anyways, it's been fun talking with you, I hope you enjoy the rest of your day!
21058	agent_1:What do you think about Drake? agent_2:I don't know anything about him but I do have a few rap-like songs.  agent_1:That's an interesting perspective. Did you know that Tupac's music is considered culturally significant by the Library of Congress?	agent_2:  I do know that Eminem's dream was to become a comic book artist. I don't think that would have become as lucrative.
30224	agent_1:The Rockets are the best offensive team this season agent_2:Really?  Well the Rockets and the Golden State warriors will meet in the western conference finals on monday night.   agent_1:Sounds like its going to be a great game,both teams are at a peak, the best two teams in the NBA 	agent_2:Yes, the warriors haven't faced a playoff challenger as good as the rockets since coach steve kerr took over in 2015.
149682	agent_1:Play a concert for a touchdown. agent_2:Yes, and have large stadiums like some colleges have that can fit 60,000 screaming fans. All of them more interested in the music than the football game. Probably have to have extra security.  agent_1:I could see that happening between scores and waiting for kicking teams to ge ready.	agent_2:Can you imagine the half time shows. Flames and light shows on the stadium LED boards. it would put an ordinary Football game to shame.
118129	agent_2:That would be a nightmare as partisan as things are now. Were you aware that the guest house is bigger than the white house? That seems strange.  agent_1:I didn't know that and I don't see how that is possible, did you know that every president with a beard has been a member of the republican party agent_2:I did not. That is a very interesting fact. I wonder if there is any data about why that is? I know that until our last election every Republican ticket that won since 1928 had a Bush or a Nixon on it. 	agent_1:ya that is kind of scary, except I don't think that is stilll true since Trump won
164108	agent_1:Do you use that information when your in the casino to give you an edge?  How many games a week do you think you watch? agent_2:I only get weekends at the casino, I always get my weekends off from work, Now it just my wife and I, no, I don't used it. agent_1:You don't have a dog by chance?  I have full house here, kids, dogs rabbits, and my wife has a horse.  Maybe I should buy myself a ticket to Las Vegas for some peace.	agent_2:Yes at least for a vacation, the chips are also located in the football to track  velocity, rotation, ball speed and location.
156071	agent_2:I do not know much and the only position I know of is the quarterback, who calls the plays and almost always throws the passes. agent_1:Did you know the NFL has no written rule against women playing in the league? agent_2:I think that is great. I am not sure most would be able to meet the requirements but it still nice to know it is an option. Better than just being a cheerleader. New Orleans Saints cheerleaders have to leave the restaurant if a football player shows up	agent_1:I have heard most teams have similar rules.
99511	agent_2:Yes I do.  I enjoy watching Big Bang Theory and Saturday Night Live. agent_1:Oh I love Big Bang Theory!  although,  I am behind at the moment lol Im only on season 8 agent_2:I'm behind to.  I heard that Comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows since it was created in 1989.  Do you know why?	agent_1:wow!  Either they are very picky or those shows sucked lol
112283	agent_1:I usually listen to spotify or pandora. agent_2:I listen to YouTube but I also listen to the regular radio sometimes. I wish I could listen to Bill Murray in the 70s on the radio though, he did the voice for the Human Torch agent_1:Oh what!  Thats cool,  Bill Murray is awesome.  Did you know that soliders were able to make a radio with a razor and pencil?	agent_2:No I didn't know that. That's so interesting I wonder how they did it, I think that was called a foxhole radio right?
82396	agent_2:Yes. But I love cars. agent_1:Oh cool. I can't believe cars were invented in 1886. I thought it was in the early 1900's. agent_2:In 20th century only cars come to human uses. Firstly for the Military uses next only for civilian uses.	agent_1:They were rapidly adopted in the US, and it took longer in Western Europe to be accepted.
17812	agent_2:I heard the government has failed to pocket any of Chapo's gains. agent_1:It wouldn't surprise me. Did you know that a 2012 study concluded that Pop Music has grown louder? agent_2:Louder and more homogeneous. I'd say more hideous haha.	agent_1:Interesting. Did you know Warner Bros signed a deal with King James for Space Jam.
32617	agent_1:That is so cool! I love how rap music has evolved. Even Koren rappers have introduced a new freestyle rap known as compliment battle that's very interesting! agent_2:Lol I never knew there was a thing as compliment rap battles, I guess they are good for self esteem agent_1:Indeed! Rappers are so talented in so many different areas even beyond rap. Tale Eminem for example: his dream was to become a comic book artist.	agent_2:Yea I heard he was a big fan of the punisher and his favorite superhero is spiderman
711	agent_2:That's pretty cool.  If he'd had a black character in it in the 1950s that was worthy of banning a science fiction comic! agent_1:That sounds really racist, theres a wiki rank of fictional characters according to power and abilities,  I wonder who is the strongest hero agent_2:Maybe like a Superman type or Hercules?  Funny thing, future emperor Julius Caesar actually wrote Hercules based fan fiction when he was younger.  I wonder what that was like.	agent_1:I bet it was pretty good, it was about Hercules and Oedipus, I wonder if he was good.
117168	agent_2:Yeah exactly, that is why he went down in history to do that agent_1:Nice. Did you know Alex Smith finished college in two years? agent_2:Wow I guess he is smart and also a great player	agent_1:Yes he is , He even started his masters degree before he was picked in the draft
9000	agent_2:Yeah that is so lame to me.  If you don't like it, then you learn your lesson and don't buy any more tickets to any more concerts.  agent_1:Exactly! So do you ever go vote in the elections at all? Pretty sad John Mccain passed away but he went through a lot, so many people died in 2018.  agent_2:Yeah there were a lot of good people who died this past year.  And yeah I do, did you know the voter turnout for US presidential elections hasn't gone over 62% in the last 100 years!?	agent_1:Really? That's it? more people need to get in to these elections because every vote counts!
147808	"agent_2:Yep I drive mine almost every day, what's crazy is that it's cold outside right now in Michigan and yet in Ohio it would be illegal to warm up my car right now agent_1:I guess that is something I take for granted about Florida.  Although we need to cool off ours in the summer. agent_2:Yeah that's true. Have you ever been inside of a self-driving car by the way? Apparently Google cars have a""aggressive mode"""	agent_1:I wonder what that looks like.
24537	agent_1:Are you a fan of the washington redskins football team? agent_2:I like football, but not necessarily the Redskins.  I did hear that they went ice fishing in Minnesota before the 92 superbowl. agent_1:What a great way to prepare for a game go sit on a boat in the freezing cold lol	agent_2:Right?! Maybe they thought it would acclimate them to the temps??? I mean the windchill was 30 below!
19771	agent_1:the UN had an ailen ambassador so they would be ready for extraterrestials?  But where did they get the ailen ambassador?  i am confused. 	agent_2:Oh, I see where you're at. No. It's a human person who has a job at the UN to be the go-to guy if aliens contact us. He's the guy that's going to talk with them and make sure they don't kill us all, I suppose.
44779	agent_1:do you like comedy? agent_2:I sure do. Do you know which movie Bill Murray thinks is the funniest? agent_1:Yes it is Kung Fu Hustle but I really do not think it is the funniest	agent_2:Me either. Did you know the Green Lantern was supposed to be a comedy?
59145	agent_1:The UN set up an ambassador for extraterrestrials in case they want to contact us! agent_2:The earth is almost 4x as dense as the sun. agent_1:And takes 365.26 days to revolve around it.	agent_2:Gotta love leap year! That .25 is really important
40810	agent_1:Hello! How are you today? agent_2:Hi! I am well.I was just shopping on Amazon. Hard to believe it was founded 7-5-1994. agent_1:That is crazy! I wish I was the first customer!	agent_2:I do too considering the first customer got a building named after them by just a $27.97 purchase.
121331	agent_1:Pretty interesting! I like to vote it makes me feel I have a little bit of a say, but you can only try I guess. I find it funny that they built a guest house at the White House that is actually larger than the White House....seems pretty strange. agent_2:I read that 34% of black male population in Alabama has lost the right to vote permanently.  I think it is because of mass incarceration. agent_1:That is horrible, not right at all. Speaking of presidents, there have only been 2 presidents who did not use a bible to be sworn in....do you know what they use if they don't use a bible?	agent_2:I don't know but I am curious to find out.  I will research the topic on the internet.  Anyway, I've got to run.  It was nice chatting with you.
59875	agent_1:Probably... He was a 6th round draft pick in 2000.  I do like Boston but I'm not sure I've ever been to Foxborough where the Pat's play. agent_2:Me neither but the Gillette Stadium in Foxborough seems like a giant stadium. Have you ever seen a live professional football game? agent_1:Yes, the Falcons and the Chiefs.  I like college better, like Georgia Tech.  They could use a Brady QB however...	agent_2:Haha, I agree, I really enjoy going to college football games. Although I never knew that the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback so other teams could not read his hand signals.
63697	agent_2:THat sounds scary. There is a planet that actually orbits four stars agent_1:Nice. Do you use facebook? agent_2:I sure do. It is mentioned in one third of all divorce filings	agent_1:WOw. DO you know why it is blue?
87458	agent_2:I haven't heard of it. What is it? agent_1:After French explored Antoine de la mothe Cadillac who founded Detroit agent_2:I've heard that drivers in India use their car horn so much, Audi had to create a new horn	agent_1:Wow. It was nice chatting with you
87468	agent_2:haha ya I think we lost our hair almost 300k years ago apparently agent_1:I wonder if there is a sound frequency that scares away hair, like there is for humans. agent_2:ya I do wonder that, also weird that humans can regrow their ribs, it only takes 3 months!	agent_1:I cut a finger off. I wish that grew back...
98122	agent_2:Interesting! What do you think of replacing politicians with scientists? Do you think that would be a good idea? agent_1:In some ways they would care about the environment and have a global perspective on that.  They would possibly see things too black and white though agent_2:Yes, and it wouldn't fit with our version of democracy, where anyone over a certain age and born in the U.S. could be elected by popular vote.	agent_1:Did you know that since the 1900's taller candidates have won 75% of the time
52394	agent_2:Yeah, cannot blame the guy. Do you like radio dramas? agent_1:I do sometimes and there is a free website where you can listen to them agent_2:Yeah pretty neat. Do you know why Michael Caine became an actor?	agent_1:Yes because all the pretty girls were in drama class
106944	"agent_2:For soldiers? Did they drive through in their tanks? Also, what's ""back in the day"" in this case? agent_1:lol, it was 1975 and they did it because soldiers couldn't leave their car in uniform agent_2:Why couldn't they leave their cars in uniform? How did they do anything while on duty?"	agent_1:Maybe it was just in public. I think things have changed a lot since then lol. It was nice chatting with you!
59443	agent_2:In china they once wore as many shirts to pop the collars ... was fashion that time should have been very stuffy  agent_1:Funny.  I like the business attire in Hawaii - aloha shirts. agent_2:sure fun and relaxing work costume indeed .. they can celebrate vacation in office 	agent_1:I feel for ballet dancers... They can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week.  Poor feet...
69069	agent_1:I see.  I dont play either.  the inventor of basketball is the only losing coach in the university of kansas.  agent_2:Okay, i don;t know. Michael Jordan was my favorite basketball player. agent_1:Its funny that michael Jordan's bff is the limo driver who gave him a lift when he first arrived in chicago lol	agent_2:I love seven wonders. Because it's all are awesome.
81091	"agent_2:Absolutely, me too. I would have ran out of there, fast! The principal did apologize for thinking that the tiger could entertain the students. Apparently the tiger was in a small cage and wheeled through the prom accompanied by spotlights and a thud of drums.  Wow, what a spectacle that must have been! agent_1:It kind of makes me sad for the animals, in that case. Poor babies shouldn't be trapped in cages! agent_2:Apparently, everyone was exclaiming ""Oh MY God"" when seeing the tiger.  Then, people dresses in tiger body suits held torches and danced while they juggled their torches. The tiger was scared!"	agent_1:Sounds like the students enjoyed it, then. Still, it was not a smart move to bring live animals, even if their handlers were always with them. Anything could go wrong.
33711	agent_2:Yes , Linkin Park once played 324 of them in a single year	agent_1:Yeah their album was too successful so they had to keep up
80582	agent_2:That's pretty unique! I heard he also loved nature and travel and such. Do you like those things? I love travel and camping. agent_1:I love to travel.  If I go to Japan though, I would only take trains. agent_2:Yes, I've heard about the enormous tolls to travel in Japan by car. It's a shame, too, because the Japanese countryside is supposed to be gorgeous!	agent_1:$300 in tall fees to drive around Japan?  I cannot afford it.
124331	agent_2:The Earth has gotten lazier over the years. I think the day will get longer as the Earth gets older. agent_1:lol yep. In 2010, the UN assigned an official ambassador to extraterrestrials. agent_2:I think that must be a cushy job. What does that person do all day? Wait and watch the skies?	agent_1:HAHA I agree. Earth will be virtually helium-free by the end of the 21st century.
98790	agent_2:Jim Carrey is a funnyman, so I guess he can make more money on the comedies. agent_1:He won't make any movies that don't project positivity. You're right, he is one funny guy. agent_2:He ought to know that any movie, no matter what the genre, can be positive. I depends on the actor.	agent_1:I'll stick with the thrillers and dramas, I really liked the horror books as a child, like Edgar Allen Poe, Murders in the Rue Morgue was my all-time fav.
96314	agent_1:Wow, I didnt.  Strait had a chance to be the weatlthiest man then if he invested in Bezos agent_2:I would think.Hard to believe U2 played as country music stars opening up for themselves in 1987 as The Dalton Brothers. agent_1:Oh wow.  I heard they wore wigs and costumes too?	agent_2:Yes, they played fully disguised. Country music got some financial support from Henry Ford to help it become more popular.
95268	agent_1:Various locations, I think its US and also Mexico, both countries are  co hosting, and yeah the womans team is pretty good, maybe we should switch teams lol. agent_2:Do you enjoy dancing?  I wish I would have been able to dance with champion cha-cha dancer Bruce Lee. agent_1:I do like dancing and that would have been nice, being a ballet dancer would bankrupt me though!!	agent_2:Well seeing a baby smile to music and dance would be worth it.
155387	agent_2:Yes they are!  Do you listen to the radio at all? agent_1:I do, I listen to the radio on my way to work, what about you? agent_2:Yes I do, but there is also a website that you can go to listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas, for free.	agent_1:Do you have the link for that site? maybe I can find it using Google, I love my drama podcasts
150360	agent_2:I enjoy country music, and other styles from working class Americans. agent_1:well you can thank Henry Ford, apparently he financed country music to stop jazz music from becoming popular agent_2:That is funny.    Did you know Jeff Bezos of Amazon is cousins with country music hall of famer George Strait!	agent_1:no I didn't know that, I do like amazon stufff, I guess african americans only make up 2 of the people in the country music hall of fame
51319	agent_2:I'm great! How are you? Do you every play video games? agent_1:I'm great - thank you. I love video games. What about you? agent_2:I used to play them. Not so much now I never got much chance to play the NES.	agent_1:Did you know Nintendo could display in only 54 colors?
5537	agent_2:Are you a fan of the World Series?  agent_1:Yes, I am. As a Cubs fan it has been difficult. Prior to the 2016 win the Ottoman Empire was still in existence the last time they won. agent_2:Interesting. Did you know the cubs were the first team to win back to back world series. 	agent_1:Yes! Did you know Babe Ruth lost game 7 of the WS in 1926.
120079	agent_1:I wonder what breakthroughs would be discovered soon. Parallel universe perhaps? agent_2:Some people even think that the universe may be one big superhologram. agent_1:that sounds so deep, I cannot ecven comprehend it. 	agent_2:And here we are, just a little speck in the universe, worried about things like politics.
38629	agent_1:Nice. Do you go to concerts much?	agent_2:I go sometimes. Did you know Ramones toured for 20 years?
160899	agent_2:Well, he's also never released his tax returns. Maybe he'll release some pop albums like the president of Indonesia has. agent_1:Yeah that might increase his popularity. It is good it's not 1805 because Clinton would be Trumps vice lol! agent_2:Well, she probably knows the West Wing better than him since she already spent 8 years there. I wonder why she never got around to re-installing solar panels while she was there--it took until George W. Bush for it to happen after Reagan had removed them in the 80s.	agent_1:Yeah I think they are a good idea. I think it's odd the white house has twin buildings in Ireland and France.
155148	agent_2:Yeah i am sure... kind of a socialistic way of doing things though isn't it? agent_1:Yes, I can't say US Radio or TV is better left to free market; though I've never listened to Canadian Radio. I knew Richard Ailes was a creator of Fox News, but did you know Richard Nixon was also? agent_2:He was... how was he involved?	agent_1:Just information, not sure it was public information because they seems a little like Pravada and Soviet era propaganda if a political party was behind a network. As you mentioned earlier Fox News has a Republican Bias and I agree.
72423	agent_2:No, that sounds like fun, I wonder how much it will cost to ride the 160 mph bus agent_1:Haha good question.  If it was in Japan, there are $300 worth of tolls to travel the country. agent_2:I'd love to travel Japan but don't think i could afford $300 in tolls after a plane ticket to Japan	agent_1:The first King to travel the world was from hawaii.
60102	agent_2:No, i have not, but i like Alexa.  agent_1:i don't either but i've used them before and they are convenient. how do you normally get the weather forecast? agent_2:I learn when the best time to check weather in advance is Yet the unflinching smiles of TV meteorologists often seem more like the grins back to the weather forecast and begrudgingly take note of their predictions for the weekend ahead.	agent_1:so do you watch on TV? i normally get the weather from my phone or weather.com
75700	agent_2:Which states have you been to? Its quite hot in Florida even during the winter. We typically get heavy rains weekly. agent_1:I have been to Florida and Alabama and Georgia. I love Florida and plan to retire there in 20 years. Where are you in Florida? agent_2:In Tampa, its not the first city you would think of, rather you would probably think of miami as the city of Florida haha!	agent_1:As a Le Batard fan, Miami is the first but I love the gulf coast. Want to move to clear water. Take care!
70928	agent_2:interesting, rap can be traced back to ancient Egyptian practices.  agent_1:I did not know that. It goes back a long time. agent_2:yes, The word originally meant to lightly strike	agent_1:Rap is also now used to describe quick speech or repartee.
149423	agent_2:Yeah, they could have bought it for $75 million and now it's worth over $104 billion. agent_1:Most of that income comes from the advertising on the site.   agent_2:Yeah, it is interesting that FB even allow marijuana advocacy and education in advertising on their site.	agent_1:I find that they are pretty progressive with some of their policies.  Then sometimes they reject before and after fitness ads because they feel it is targeting people improperly.  lol
13424	agent_2:I know. Do you use Reddit a lot? agent_1:I use it sometimes. less that 1% of people in there vote on the content though agent_2:Yeah. They have a page with the best 25 deeds done	agent_1:SO cool. Nice chatting with you
14005	agent_1:I sure do. Bruce Lee was also a great dancer agent_2:Nice awesome. Emilia Clarke did the chicken dance and robot dance when she auditioned for Daenaeryus agent_1:Haha that is amazing. Yeah Bruce Lee won the cha cha championship in 1958	agent_2:Wow amazing. Parrots are good at dancing to music
99703	agent_1:I'm not a big fan either but I respect the sport. Did you know that granny style is the most effective way to score points on the line? agent_2:LOL! No, I did not! To be honest, I played when I was a kid and always found that to be rather tough. No wonder I was never offered $10 million from a sneaker company when I was 18 like Lebron James was. agent_1:Lebron James gets offered a lot of money. At one point he was the highest paid celebrity. Surprisingly Jude Judy was number two. 	agent_2:Now I do like Judge Judy. I'd never want to be in her courtroom - Usually both sides failed at exhibiting common sense multiple occasions to wind up there(!) - But she is a no nonsense judge. Darn shame the courts aren't full of people like her. Speaking of failing to exhibit common sense, 78% of NFL players go bankrupt within 2 years of retiring, while 60% of NBA players are broke after 5 years. Why do you think that is?
149285	agent_1:Yeah I guess they need to be safe when travelling and not out with the public agent_2:Yeah. Did you know republicans and democrats play a game of baseball ever year? agent_1:Yeah and the republicans are winning by three points	agent_2:Yeah. DId you know Elmo once testified in COngress
122531	agent_1:Hello!  Did you know the first president of Zimbabwe was named Banana? lol agent_2:Good afternoon.  No, I didn't know that.  How funny! agent_1:lol  The president is the common title of most republic states.  Did you know that the president of Indonesia released 3 pop albums while in office?	agent_2:No, didn't know that tidbit, but how interesting.  I could see Trump trying his hand at that!
16827	agent_2:Yea, apparently baby boomers don't like rock music or long hair agent_1:Maybe they like beards, because every US president with a beard has been a republican. agent_2:Yea and since 1928 every republican ticket has had a Bush or it too, or a Nixon	agent_1:Oh wow, that is true! Maybe the next election would break the record that there hasn't been a US president who wasn't a Republican or Democrat since 1800s
74729	agent_1:Wow, that's quite a bit of money!  Hope they put it all to a good cause!  :)  Maybe next up they'll do a reddit radio! agent_2:That could be pretty interesting! I wonder if it made it on the kindest deeds list! agent_1:Maybe!  Well, listen it was GREAT talking to you!  You have a terrific evening!	agent_2:It was great chatting with you too! Have a great night!
157010	agent_2:I'm fine. How are you doing? agent_1:Great do you follow politics? agent_2:Sometimes I follow politics. What about you?	agent_1:Same here! Voters in North Virginia seemed to really support Hilary 2 years ago.
130412	agent_1:Did you know that, according to Canadian law, 40% of the music on the radio must be by Canadian artists? That would explain why Drake is so popular.  agent_2:No I didn't actually it seems like that might be the case for Justin Bieber as well his song 'baby' is the most disliked video on youtube agent_1:It was, up until a few weeks ago. Now, YouTube Rewind 2018 holds that record. Do you think that YouTube will be replaced soon, as much as creators are hating it?	agent_2:oh that's good to know I wasn't aware. No I think that people will copy off of it like the police officers have Blutube there will be other knock off youtubes but nothing quite the same to replace it all together
163137	agent_2:Yeah, and I believe he was a successful actor too. Bill Nye got his break by winning a steve martin lookalike contest agent_1:Hahah that is so funny. Did you ever play nintendo? agent_2:Yes, I did. I had the original, which only could display 54 colors	agent_1:Yeah that is so cool. nice chatting with you.
24436	"agent_2:that is too funny. I learned that the music is played using a waterphone agent_1:I don't even know what a waterphone is.  I did learn that Edgar Allen Poe is considered ""horror"".  I remember the ""Tell Tale Heart."" agent_2:I loved his books and it funny how modern horror is inspired by him"	agent_1:Yeah, its too bad he died so young.  Love him... Ii wonder if people would read him and then go to a modern art museum
89273	"agent_2:I agree. Do you think LeBron's acting career will make it long-term? agent_1:That's the thing.  I haven't seen ""Space Jam""  I know, I know... but Jordan already did it.  So the best I can say is maybe. agent_2:I saw 1 movie that he is in, I forgot the name but Kevin Hart is in it too. And I could not give a fair opinion if his acting was good, I am biased, it's LeBron we are talking about. lol"	agent_1:True,
26942	agent_1:That is crazy!  That must be a very powerful type of fish to be able to do that! agent_2:Kind of like some of the snakes out there that can eat huge animals. agent_1:Yeah, just like them.  Say, did you know that freshwater fish get their water through osmosis but salt water fish actually drink it?	agent_2:Interesting. I did not know that. The sounds that are emitted by fish can vary depending on the species and stimulus. I thought that was interesting.
62458	agent_1:Nice that is pretty cute. TIm Curry does the voice of Slick in the cartoon version agent_2:Oh awesome. The movie paid The Rock 20$ million, that is a lot of money agent_1:Wow that is and the total budget was $91 so he got a good chunk	agent_2:Yeah that is true. Do you use your phone much?
129571	agent_1:Yeah. Even Jon Steward was a player for the US team at the panamerican games in Brazil agent_2:Yeah. Mesut Ozil donated his winnings from the world cup to kids in brazil agent_1:Yes and helped 23 of them have surgeries. Nice chat	agent_2:He sure changed many lives. Same here, have a good day
36129	agent_1:I still have a pretty good CD collection. I don't like the idea of not actually owning the stuff I pay for because of digital copyright, and with a Chromebook I've got limited space for downloads. Listen to a lot of albums on YouTube though. agent_2:do you have the Hybrid THeory album in your collection? I guess it is the best selling album of the 21st century agent_1:No, but I've listened to it on YouTube a lot. I love Linkin Park. Do you like them?	agent_2:they're ok, not my favorite but I like pink floyd a lot, they still have best selling records!
29473	agent_1:So in the meantime, what do you browse online? I like to learn about the universe agent_2:I do too. Do you think that the universe is one big superhologram? agent_1:Who knows? Perhaps the world is one big matrix. I don't think the universe is just one electron though	agent_2:Some scientists think that universes evolve just like humans through natural selection. I want to know what they've been smoking
60653	agent_2:Who is Anne Jones? agent_1:She holds the world record for speed reading. 4,700 words per minute agent_2:Oh I see, I didnt know there was a world record for that lol, do you know who George R.R. Martin is?	agent_1:The Game of Thrones guy? Yeah, he never seems to get any written these days.
30324	agent_1:ya he seems like a nice guy, for every 3 point shot he makes in a game, his foundation donates 3 mosquito nets to areas affected by malaria agent_2:Hope he scores a lot of 3 point shots then. It's in the best interest of those kids. He won the MVP award back in 2014-2015 season agent_1:ya its crazy that he won the MVP award and yet only has the 5th highest salary, you'd think they'd pay him more!	agent_2:Yeah I thought he was the highest paid player in the team, he helped the team return to the NBA finals and won two titles, that is impressive, he should earn a lot more money
138361	agent_2:I did hear about that, declining several offers! Silly choice! Now Netflix is worth 2 billion! agent_1:Yeah that is true. Yet though they still spend more on postage than on bandwidth agent_2:That's just crazy! But what isn;t crazy these days. Like it is impossible to separate 2 old phone books, a bit of trivia!	agent_1:Yeah that is actually quite funny. Did you ever use a rotary phone?
145871	agent_2:Yep, and maybe make it on the radio.  Everyone can find a way to access the radio, like the soldiers in WWII who made radios out of a razor blade and pencil. agent_1:You could probably even find it online. Even the classic radio dramas can be found for free online agent_2:Yes, which could come in handy if you're in Canada.  Apparently, Canada requires 40% of the music played to be Canadian.  I'd get pretty tired of Alanis Morisette 40% of the time.	"agent_1:That's not the only Canadian artist. If we though ""Call Me Maybe"" was overplayed in the US, how much more would it have been played in Canada since she's Canadian?"
50162	agent_1:He was confused when he went to Britain and they were using chickens for entertainment. agent_2:Perhaps Julius was into satire, portraying persons as corrupt and alienating them from the audience. agent_1:for sure! Imagine if he used a nintendo back then	agent_2:I find it interesting to note that the Nintendo system could only display 54 colors.  Julius would have liked it.
29638	agent_2:WOW... that is cool!  Never even given that a thought how they do that!  DO you think the solos are strange? agent_1:No, I think the solos are the best part, they give each performer the chance to spread their wings a bit in a sense.  agent_2:Yeah... definitely allows creative freedom!	agent_1:Exactly, did you know that Clint Eastwood is a huge jazz fan? He even scored several of his films.
133988	agent_2:Yeah that sounds like a great option, sometimes the best option is none of them. Voter turnout has been really low over the years. agent_1:It sure has, I don't think it has been over 60% in the past 100 years. agent_2:heat that kind of sucks, that how leaders like Trump get elected in the end, voter turn up should be greater.	agent_1:I agree. It's insane that Wikileaks published the plans for the government to destroy wikileaks. I thought they had chosen a side in our politics.
9029	agent_1:I use that and bing so I can earn some amazon gift cards. agent_2:How does the gift card thing work? agent_1:Look up bing rewards.  You earn points for doing searches but they have a limit on the amount you can earn each day.  Did you know that google was created over 20 years ago already in 1998?	agent_2:Yes. Wish I'd invested in Google stock when they made 2004 public offering!
133339	agent_2:Visiting while I was in the Navy.  The best way to earn a small fortune in Japan is to start with a large one. agent_1:lol :) navy huh ? Was it interesting there ? agent_2:It's like...  okay, think of New York, but WAY more lights and you are surrounded by people who you have no idea what they are saying.   I will say that they are insanely polite though.  	agent_1:That what I was about to ask You... how are the people over there ;)
155921	agent_1:There would be so much autotune! agent_2:hahahaaaa.. Well played!  They would probably interupt each other all the time! agent_1:Oh geez that would be such an annoying session. Can you imagine being the audio engineer on that project. It might not be worth it.	agent_2:LOL... yeah... he would quit!  Kanye, Trump and the president of Indonesia making an album together!!!
162082	agent_1:I agree.  86% of the land in Nevada is owned by the US government. agent_2:It must be Area 51.  Where they keep all the good stuff.  LOL agent_1:lol yes!  Do you want to talk about presidents now?	agent_2:As long as we can start with the first president of Zimbabwe.
20362	"agent_2:I don't have any personal experience with the company, but I'm really intrigued to see where they go with their ideas. Elon Musk is so innovative. agent_1:Yes, i think so. Didn't know Toyota owns %10 of Tesla. agent_2:I wonder if they want to make sure not to miss out on a potentially successful new car idea, like doing the opposite of Blockbuster and buying into their industry's ""Netflix."""	agent_1:could be? I love driving electric cars. No sound. lol
94645	agent_2:I like them too. I think it's interesting that even though Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon was released over 40 years ago, it was actually in the top sellers back in 2014. agent_1:I miss when One Direction were together. That is interesting. agent_2:I hate it when good bands break up. There was a set of Japanese twins that actually made a rap album together at the age of 100! I think that's pretty awesome.	agent_1:If only I know the name of the Japanese twin's music, I would be down to listen to it?
36752	agent_2:Haha. Guess he showed that exec! Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures agent_1:Thats interesting.  agent_2:Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognizable and familiar..	agent_1:Cool. The nintendo entertainment system could display only 54 colors.
92301	agent_1:Sounds exciting! I should look into it. By the way, do you like dogs? agent_2:Yes, as long as they belong to other people.  Dogs can do so much to help people out. agent_1:I did not know that there are 12 different blood types for dogs , and that they  can donate blood at dog blood drives.	agent_2:Another odd medical fact about dogs is that they are not colorblind, but they have a lesser color palate than humans.
50646	agent_2:yea i saw it last week and loved it, have you? agent_1:Yes my kids wanted me to buy it pretty much as soon as it came out. They loved the first one.  agent_2:which came out 13 years ago! it doesn't seem like its been that long	agent_1:No it doesn't. I am glad that they kept the same story line though. It would have been weird to jump ahead.
108294	agent_1:That would make for an interesting dynamic. Many interesting news stories. Plus nothing would get done. agent_2:Haha I agree. Can you imagine President Trump and vice president Hillary Clinton? There would be so much drama the unbelievable agent_1:They would gossip and backstab the entire time. The entire planet would not be big enough for the both of them.	agent_2:LOL I like the way you think. What do you think about our planet though? Only five planets in our solar system are actually visible to the naked eye from planet Earth
119264	agent_1:Ha ha, that's funny. I wonder how that went over? agent_2:I bet not too well lol. agent_1:Me too. Did you know that 86% of the land in Nevada is government owned?	agent_2:I did not know that. I wonder if they have a bunch of secret military bases everywhere?
89208	agent_2:Yeah. Success and money seem to follow LeBron... Did you know that his old high school used to charge upwards of $120 per ticket to see him play? Amazing. agent_1:Wow, so people were crazy about him even before he got to the NBA, I heard he rejected a $10 million deal from Reebok once agent_2:Yeah, imagine, passing up $10 million with confidence that another better deal was on the horizon...and he was right!  Nike paid him $90 milllion just a year later!	agent_1:I would have taken the money lol, he was only 18 back then I guess his confidence paid off in the end, now he has better deals than those
69719	agent_2:Hello,  yes I like horses.  Did you know clint eastwood is allergic to horses? lol he does so many western movies .  agent_1:yeah I wonder how he does that agent_2:Probably a lot of Claritin lol 	agent_1:haha I think so too. icelandic horses have a fifth speed
149994	agent_2:lol  I wonder why the University of Iowa painted their visitors locker room pink? agent_1:Ha ha yeah that is really funny. Since they painted only the visiting football teams locker room it must be as sort of an intimidation technique. agent_2:That's what I'm thinking.  The top bowlers in the 1906's made twice as much as the top football stars of that era.	agent_1:I wonder how much bowlers make these days. Definitely not twice as much as top football stars I would guess.
162134	agent_2:I do like learning about the government. agent_1:Awesome. I think the ideal government should have a delicate balance between the principle of individual freedom and the idea of absolute state authority. agent_2:That is certainly not the case in china where they censored the word censorship.	agent_1:Yes I feel bad for the Chinese people. I love the Norwegian government for donating $1 billion to save the rain forest.
43082	agent_1:How do you feel about Fox News?  agent_2:I think it's ok but they are a little biased. agent_1:I know right! I think most ppl think that but some how they are watched more than msnbc and cnn combined. 	agent_2:Probably because they are in 86 countries worldwide.  Strength in numbers might help tip the scale?
103038	agent_1:right lol. Did you know they even have internet now on top of MT everest agent_2:Oh, those kids and their selfies! I bet Kim Kardashian was behind that installation. agent_1:I bet she was, everyone needs their instagram fame lol. Do you know what the three horizontal line menu is on apps is called?	agent_2:The sammich icon. I dunno.
54401	agent_1:I don't understand.  Do you like to travel?  You might want to check out the 160mph Dutch train if you do. agent_2:Yeah I do like to travel and that sounds like a great invention, a real time saver and plus you can admire the landscape agent_1:Beats traveling on a horse-drawn carriage or a bike on Mackinac Island... 	agent_2:I hear Mackinac island is a great place, its actually located in the US sounds like a relaxing place
42197	agent_2:haha! True! I guess I never thought of that, Wonder if it was just slippery with all the slobber. I would Love to take on the Guitar... I love the sound of the strings agent_1:Guitar is a good instrument. I play piano personally and I like that a lot. Do you ever watch any sports though? agent_2:Nice, The piano is beautiful too and so romantic! I do occasionally watch sports. I watch some basketball although not too often, how about you?	agent_1:Yeah I watch it from time to time. They only have one team in Canada, and I have friends in Canada, so that's the team I like haha. It's the Toronto Raptors
16528	agent_2:No, I did not.  Now I do. agent_1:Yep and the actor who voices jarvis has never seen the movies! agent_2:Really?  That was odd.  Apparently, Avengers:  Infinity War is the first film ever to be shot entirely with digital imax cameras.	agent_1:That's cool and that the original Incredible Hulk actor has been the voice of the Hulk up to this day since the 70's!!
82093	agent_2:I did. I watched a ton of it as a kid. There were well over 700 episodes of it. I wonder how many years that comes out to? I'm in my late 20s...it's gotta be over 15. agent_1:50 episodes over 16 years! I remember watching it as a kid too! Great chatting with you! agent_2:You too, have a good day!	agent_1:Thanks!
148707	agent_1:ya not only their location but also the balls velocity and rotation, lots of great stats for tracking, I'm just glad they dont' use them on civilians agent_2:yeah for sure. do you like tom brady? agent_1:I do like Tom Brady I think he's a super cool guy, it's weird though have you heard that Kellan Moore is the only left-handed quarterback?	agent_2:Yeah amongst to many qb how can he be the only one?
122936	"agent_2:Not me. I avoid Facebook as much as possible. I might even move to the German state of Schleswigholstein, where the FB ""Like"" button is illegal! agent_1:I don't mind it as much. At first the ads were annoying, but I guess that's how they make most of their revenue. I'm trying to remember if MySpace had ads agent_2:I will ask my dog. He was the only member of my family that had a Myspace page. Can you believe MS had a chance to buy FB and balked?  Now MS is history and FB is big brother."	agent_1:$75 million might have seemed overpriced at the time, but by 2012, Facebook was worth $04 billion
100289	agent_1:I read somewhere that it is legal to equip your car with flame throwers to prevent carjacking.  Did you know that? agent_2:I read about it somewhere.  That must be a serious case of car theft! agent_1:I think it is in South Africa, that's funny.	agent_2:wow,  thats horrible,  its already crazy hot there and then you got flame throwers on cars.
75258	agent_1:Yeah that is pretty cool. Do you know how Cadillac got its name? agent_2:That is crazy that flame throwers are allowed on cars in south africa to prevent car jacking agent_1:I know, pretty insane. Cadillac got its name from the founder of detroit whose last name was Cadillac	agent_2:What was your first car? Mine was an ugly green ford torino with a white vinyl top. It used more oil than gas
55360	agent_1:lol Im not sure i dont watch that channel much.  That is pretty crazy though,  that is a lot of turn over.  agent_2:South Park has not fallen under the ax. I expect they have a few more years left. what would those guys do anyway. they work three months a year on the show. thats pretty good agent_1:Oh right,  south park!  I dont even watch that on real tv though, I just stream it lol 	agent_2:yeah, that is the way to go. the TV is just so old now. everything is on the internet. Anyway, great chat!
160708	agent_1:I did not know that, very interesting.  Do you ever listen to the radio online? agent_2:I do once in awhile or Youtube plays in the background as I am on my computer. agent_1:I might start, I guess there is a site where you can listen to thousands of classic radio dramas for free. 	agent_2:Yes, I have heard that but haven't tried it. Sounds interesting though.
82078	agent_1:Just deciding what superhero move to watch on Netflix! Any recommendations? agent_2:Are you a Marvel or DC fan?  agent_1:Marvel for sure! However, the dark knight trilogy is my favorite!	agent_2:Kindred spirits! I'd suggest anything that will help you get ready for Endgame...which includes Spider-Man, Iron Man, Cpt America, Thor, Hulk, Captain Marvel, Black Panther, Doctor Strange and so on. Stan Lee is a genius...well...was a genius. His work is astounding.
147556	agent_1:Reading take time and the will to interpret concepts and ideas.  agent_2:I do agree with you there. I always wanted to learn how to read Braille agent_1:It is quite complex, and you would have to turn up the sensitivity of the tips of your fingers.	agent_2:I am headed to the library now to check out a book to read.
74225	agent_1:Do you usually use the computer to find information on celebrities? agent_2:I sometimes do, I have a movie server so I have to look up movies a lot actually, what about you? agent_1:I do as well. It is amazing how far computers have come. We can use them as general purpose devices like personal computers and smartphones or for industrial or special uses like a microwave	agent_2:that is true, I think it's wild that the space shuttle only used 1mb of ram, I know this laptop I'm on now has 16GB which is substantially more haha
93894	agent_2:In Ohio it is illegal to warm up your car! I would not be able to hop in a cold car and go. agent_1:how could people do that? doesnt it get cold in ohio? i thought people would have to warm up. agent_2:I would have to say it gets cold. Do you know what the little arrow next to the gas gauge is for in your car?	agent_1:i guess that it has something to do with the gas tank? i dunno.
122168	agent_2:I see it as an option to get more people to come in and vote.  If you have only a few options, and you don't want any of them, the odds are greater that you won't come in to vote.  But, that means that you won't vote on other issues on the same ballot.  By including a none of the above option, it gives people an option and still leaves the rest of the ballot available to them. agent_1:that is a good point. If you feel forced to vote for a bad choice, you may not want to vote. Do you think we should vote on Supreme court justices? they seem to have more of an effect on life in the US than any other entity. and they are lifelong appointments that can drastically change the legal landscape.  agent_2:I don't think we should vote on them, but I don't agree with the lifelong appointments.  I would love to see a setup where they are given a 10 year appointment.  It would limit their effect, or at least give a changing effect over time.  The only real issue with it would be the nomination and confirmation process through the Senate.  Can you imagine having to re-seat a full court every year?  It's horrible enough to watch the debates on even a single judge like Kavanaugh.	agent_1:that would be a mess. how do you feel about Russian involvement in our elections?  do you believe trump when he says things like he is tougher on Russia than other presidents?
21875	agent_2:Yes, but I have not invested too much of myself in it. I took an astronomy class in college & I was amazed at how people used to judge time and seasons by using the sun & stars agent_1:Yeah, that is fascinating.  I am still wondering how those scientists carried out such peculiar measurements agent_2:i think people from back in the day were very intelligent & observant, most of us would not last a week without the assistance of technology	agent_1:Exactly.  I believe they had some kind of method or way of figuring things out
92831	agent_1:I sitll havent seen that show lol its on my list though agent_2:It's a popular show. He does a good job in it. What do you think of Jim Carrey? agent_1:Really like Jim carrey,  loved him in Liar Liar!	agent_2:He does only comedy now. Doesn't want to do drama. Not enough positivity.
23582	agent_1:I used to read a lot when I was younger and now, probably, read a lot of literature about business. I kind of regret about it. But I like sci-fi. It's so cool.Starship Troopers is a good choice.  agent_2:Agreed. I figured if it made the military reading list, it must be good! I love reading but I'll never be able to top the world record for speed reading of 4700 words per minute that Anne Jones set. Ha! agent_1:I'm really wondering can this person express what was meaning of the text? 4700 words is crazy!	agent_2:I know, right? That just sounds unbelievable. Ha! What's almost as unbelievable to me is there was actually a moral panic over the spread of reading novels back in the18th century. It's like how and why would that lead to a moral panic?
72491	agent_1:You can use your library card to check out books for your kindle or e-reader now. I personally love to do that. Even audiobooks. You can actually get a lot of things from libraries now. Like sewing machines and tools.   agent_2:That is true. I actually heard about that very library in Sacramento and would love to check it out someday. But hey, it's too bad America can't be like Norway where the government buys 1000 copies of your book and distributes them to libraries across their country! agent_1:That's kind of crazy, a lot of people write awful books! But i guess Norway has a smaller population and they w ant to encourage their homegrown authors. Anyway I think television has taken a lot of people away from reading.	agent_2:That is true and we're all guilty of watching too much television. I especially like the Simpson's although there's one episode where Bart never makes an appearance nor is he mentioned that I want to see but haven't yet!
125175	agent_2:Yes. I listen often. Yes its complicated. I never think of that. I guess  i take radio for granted. agent_1:Yea I guess I do too consider WWII soldiers had to make their radios out of a pencil and razorblade agent_2:I have heard that before. I really want to see how that is done. Maybe you tube can show me how.	agent_1:Sounds like a fun weekend project. I'd also like to know how to pick up Jupiter's radio storms with an AM radio
75904	agent_1:Its annoying and can disturb others in the plane the you get complaints from the flight attendants, so being prepared is a must agent_2:Yeah I think I read that babies weren't allowed to cry for more than 5 mins. on United flights.  agent_1:But how can you stop them, it must be really hard to do so	agent_2:Yeah and that is the real problem, is how do you control a baby way up there in the air where you can't just walk away?
157678	agent_1:Really, how so? agent_2:Did you know that radio carries information on the waves by just slightly modulating their amplitude.  Amplitude is just the size of the wave like in the ocean.  The radio station number is just a frequency of wave. agent_1:Oh my goodness!  You are speaking Greek, to me.  But, I kind of sorta understand that concept.	agent_2:It is just like waves in the ocean.  Frequency is how often the wave peaks arrive on the shore.  So 100 on FM is 100 MHz if I remember correctly.  M is mega and Hz is hertz.  Mega is 1 million and Hertz is 1 time per second.
2122	agent_1:That is really nice. they can have one of the 12 types of blood agent_2:Do you have a dog, If yes what breed of dog and his name? agent_1:I do not unfortunately for now. Maybe later. Dogs can also donate blood that is so cool	agent_2:Wow, that is cool, do you know any of your personal friend's dog that donated blood?
94433	agent_1:It was amazing food. The governments and people were a bit different, but not to the point where I felt confused. agent_2:That sounds good. A man in france impersonated a government official, and managed to sell the eiffel tower not once, but twice. Did you get a chance to meet this guy? agent_1:Nope, however I would have totally bought it.  Transport home would be a problem though.  You know luggage weight requirements....	agent_2:You could have it shipped over on a boat I think. Transatlantic travel now is inexpensive.
51835	agent_2:Did your st bernard work forty hour weeks like Piper did? agent_1:In her teens, yes. She was a sled dog that did a lot of work when I would cut down trees. The last 2 years were really sad. She just laid around a lot.] agent_2:That's tough. Did she suffer from cancer? I can't imagine how much pain any dog that has cancer goes through.	agent_1:No, just old age and arthritis, which made moving around tough. We were blessed with 10 years. Most St Bernards only get 7-8.]
43551	agent_1:He was a late bloomer. Didn't graduate high school until he was 25! agent_2:That is funny. He owns shoes that weigh about 100 pounds. weird agent_1:I hope he doesn't have to run in those shoes! He will not win any races.... He does like first edition books though. I wish I had a few of those titles.	agent_2:Imagine racing someone wearing those shoes!
150838	"agent_1:That's neat.  Alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that he entered university as a junior.  agent_2:One smart guy.  Did you hear that the Jackson's ""victory tour"" played a major role in robert kraft buying sullivan stadium and the new england patriots agent_1:No, I didn't realize that.  Near the end of super bowl 46, the new england patriots let the new york giants score a touchdown, and the giants tried to avoid scoring a touchdown, both to increase their odds of winning. the giants involuntarily scored a touchdown but won anyway."	agent_2:that is strange! Did you know that the quarterback with the most wins in the cleveland browns home stadium is Ben Roethlisberger since their reintroduction in 1999
126454	agent_2:I'm surprised that Trump isn't on that list. Maybe it isn't completely up to date.  agent_1:Trump isn't particularly rich compared to them. He over inflates his worth according to people who know. He's still got a lot more than I do.  agent_2:I think if we went back to when the runner up was the vice president we would have more cooperation between the parties. 	agent_1:I agree. I wonder why they stopped that practice. It makes a lot of sense to me.
114911	agent_2:That is true.  Since the electoral college in most states is all or nothing, an independent cannot win.  Strange that every president with a beard was republican agent_1:Yes, very strange, really. I liked how JFK looked. He was handsome, not republican, but a nice person, I think. In 2000 is when the consistent use of red and blue colors started. agent_2:Yes.  I actually saw one TV network that used those colors in reverse before 2000.  Truman would not take a picture with Dumbo because the elephant was the symbol for republicans.	agent_1:Yes, he was very peculiar. Thank you for working with me, it was a very difficult subject and we didn't fight. Nice to meet you. Giving you an excelent.
139401	agent_2:Interesting,  Judge Judy makes a lot per episode. One of the highest paid celebrities. agent_1:oh definitely, she is second only to lebron James for highest paid celebrity apparently agent_2:Interesting about Robin Williams with performing voices in animated films.	agent_1:oh for sure, he started the original trend of celebs performing in animated films
16563	agent_2:I have purchased on the amazon. Have you? agent_1:yes,Do you think the service will be useful for you on the website agent_2:It has been reaaly helpful in buying hard to find items or everyday items I do not want to go out and buy. Do you enjoy the amazon?	agent_1:yes i like very much,Buying things as it is at home is useful
54553	agent_1:Only two of them, wow, I guess there are more running backs and wide receivers then agent_2:I guess. Did you know that IMDB is owned by Amazon? agent_1:I didnt know that I love to shop at Amazon, do you ?	agent_2:Absolutely. I have a package coming tomorrow, good thing the USPS has that contract with Amazon.
97520	agent_1:Do you like to go to concerts? agent_2:I do, what about you? I just love live music agent_1:I think I'd like to go. I've only ever been to one concert and it was indoors so it doesn't really count.	agent_2:I see, did you liked it? I went to a Creed concert back in 2002, terrible mistake, terrible concert
90380	"agent_2:OK, I'll be more careful.  I less pleasant topic... Did you hear about the woman that attacked her ex-boyfriend with acid when he told her he had a new girlfriend?  It happened in the UK. agent_1:well, that is a great topic! i did not know about that. that is horrible. she really should be punished for that.  agent_2:The judge gave her a minimum of 12 years in prison. The judge called it ""an act of pure evil"". "	agent_1:it was. god, why would someone do that? i understand anger, but to destroy a life...hm. i guess she will have 12 years to hink about that.
84925	agent_1:Hi, how are you this morning? agent_2:I am good, yourself? I hope they find the missing Chinese tourist. She is too young to have been on her own and I am sorry that she got kidnapped agent_1:I'm good, thanks for asking.  I hope they find her too.  So much bad stuff in the news all the time, it seems like.	agent_2:I guess good news doesn't sell. Someone should be watching over young girls at all times. It is very unsafe for them.
77965	agent_2:Did you get in on the initial IPO in 2012? agent_1:no, but i did see that it was valued at 104 billion  the largest validation to date for a newly public listing. agent_2:A good majority of divorces have a correlation to facebook as well in some form or fashion	agent_1:right i so do agree, and did you know that burger king  had a promotion where if you unfriend ten people on facebook you get a free whopper
64249	agent_2:high tech thieves! agent_1:The iPhone is also a high-tech invention that has people under scrutiny.  agent_2:So, the police was able to track the thieves using the iPhone, correct?	agent_1:I know that the thieves took an iPhone. I don't about tracking them but Apple does use the iPhone to track people.
37536	agent_1:Do you use facebook? agent_2:Yes I do.  It is such a part of my life that I still can't believe it's been around since 2004 or that I've been using it for so many years. agent_1:What do you do on it?	agent_2:I guess the same things that most everyone does. That is,except for people in the german state of Schleswig-Holstein.  In that state the like button is illegal.  What do you do on it?
140200	agent_1:by canadian law, all radios are required to have at least 40% of the music played be canadian agent_2:Are you serious? So there isnt too much variety in Canada is there. How old is radio? agent_1:right its a funny law! the radio has been aroubd since wwii. No one knows a forsure time or year!	agent_2:Do know if the radio is available everywhere or are there certain parts of the world where it cant reach.
38994	agent_1:I'm on my iphone all the time. I actually play Pokemon Go a lot, even though I'm an adult agent_2:For a while, I was even using my phone to keep up on baseball scores when I couldn't watch the game. Do you have any interest in the MLB? agent_1:I do! I'm a New Yorker and a huge Yankees fan, though I do root for the Mets as well :)	agent_2:I would like to meet some Japanese who watch American baseball, because I hear they're big fans of the sport. Have a good evening!
67540	agent_2:UNICEF has a program that they donate clean water when you don;t use your cell phone for a minute  agent_1:I know, I wonder how the track that?   agent_2:I don't know, two phonebooks with pages overlapped together are impossible to separate 	agent_1:Sounds trickey.  Nice chatting with you!
56490	agent_2:that is a very good question. at least people are more conscious now a days on not wearing animal skins since a very cruel act agent_1:Yes it is. There is even a store in Alabama that sells stuff from unclaimed baggage at airports! If you lose your bag go to that store! It was nice talking with you today! agent_2:really they sell other people clothing that is crazy	agent_1:Yes that is kind of funny and sad! Some clothing is gender neutral but others are more specific. Hard to tell these days lol. It was nice talking to you today!
100468	agent_2:Interesting, no I'm not familiar with it. What were they fighting about?  agent_1:It's quite small and corrupted country. Sp after some street demonstation of over 100,000 (total population I believe is about 4-5 million), new prime minister came to power. It was illegal way to change head of government, but opposition didn't have a choice to win elections agent_2:Interesting, what makes it corrupt? They have a bad legal system there or something? 	agent_1:I'm not sure. My knowledge isn't deep enough. I guess it would be combination of factors, but I don't know much. It's pro-Russian country. I know Georgia - next to Armenia is pro-American and much less corrupted.
53512	agent_2:Stranger things is cool, and so was the Making a Murder series.  Blockbuster really missed on on their bid to buy Netflix and then went totally out of business! agent_1:Yeah, I heard they ha a chance to buy it for $50 mill and now it's worth $2 billion.  I bet SOMEONE is kicking themselves hard over that decision!   agent_2:It goes both ways, and I'm sure someone at Netflix is patting themselves on the back for declining that offer!	agent_1:You know what's weird though, is supposedly they spend 20 times more on postage than bandwidth.  I didn't think that many people would still be getting DVDs/Bluerays from them.
86892	agent_1:Yeah, the price seems reasonable. He will also play with his three younger brothers agent_2:I'm sure the show will be incredible. just love the sound of acoustic guitars. I tried learning to play the guitar once but I wasn't coordinated enough to get both my hands cooperating at the same time.  agent_1:My hands were not big enough for the guitar we had and my parents did not want to get me a different one. :( Must be nice to be like Matthew Bellamy and to have a lot of extra guitars on hand. He has the world record for most smashed guitars on tour	agent_2:No kidding! When I tried learning to play we didn't have a guitar pick around so I tried to use a coin like Brian May from Queen.
90316	agent_1:Now that is pretty cool. I play the guitar, but learning the piano would be neat.  I read that there was a piano on the top of Britain;s highest mountain.  Wonder how it got there! agent_2:That's a good question. I wonder if it's still there! You know, speaking of pianos, they built an aluminum grand piano thag only weighed 356 pounds for the Airship Hindenburg lounge. That is so light! agent_1:That is light, I wonder if it sounds the same!  Well any it was a nice chat!  Have a great day! 	agent_2:I wonder that as well. I'm 1930, the BBC broadcasted only piano music after deciding there was no news worth reporting. Wonder if that piano sounded like the Airship Hindenburg piano? Well, it was nice chatting with you as well! Take care, friend!
53025	agent_1:kids would have liked unfriending people for a free whopper though, that was a promotion burger king really did with facebook. super silly  agent_2:I'd like to think that my friends are worth more than a whopper. I wouldn't trade them for a sandwich. agent_1:you could have easily just said, im gonna unfriend you for a burger, go eat it. and then friend them again. pretty big loophole i'd say 	agent_2:Absolutely!!! Now that might be a good idea. Well. It's been fun chatting. Have a good night.
89835	agent_1:I guess everyone know lebron was headed for the pros. they wanted to see him early on. i understand. i wish he had gotten some of that money. agent_2:I think hes ok,  he turned down a 10 mill offer because he knew he could get more,  Nike offered 90 mill agent_1:I bet he had some good advisers and agents around him. he could have waited another year and made more	agent_2:Maybe.  I hear he is also going to be in the next space jam.
86648	agent_2:Clint eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast, pianist, and scored several films, including million dollar baby agent_1:I didn't know he was a pianist.  Do you follow NBA?  Physicists proved shooting granny style consistently is the best way to shoot points on the line agent_2:I do. That's interesting... Reggie miller, nba hall of famer, couldn't escape his older sister cheryl's shadow while in high school. on january 26, 1982, he scored a career high 40 points. he tried bragging about it on the car ride home, only to find out cheryl scored 105 points and broken 8 national records!	agent_1:Allen Iverson got a lifetime contract with reebok in 2001 for $800000 per year until he is 55 then he gets $32,000,000
76340	agent_1:Yes I watch a lot of drama on TV actually. I love the show House, it stars Hugh Laurie as Doctor house. I can't believe he makes 700,000 per episode though agent_2:That is very impressive, I'm surprised he makes that much for each episode! agent_1:Well it makes more sense then Jim Carrey not making dramas anymore. He says they don't throw up positivity but I think that they can	agent_2:I think that is kind of noble of him.  But, I do agree with you that they definitely can.
150317	agent_1:I  haven seen that before so maybe it hasnt happened, did you hear about the married couple that scheduled all the 2430 games of the league agent_2:Yeah, I bet they were relieved to give that job up.  That is no joke.  Did you know the Albuquerque Isotopes minor league team is named for the Simpsons team? agent_1:They are a real team what? I used to love that team in The Simpsons, so funny lol	agent_2:Yeah, I guess they are.  I think that is pretty neat.  The Simpsons was always one of my favorites.
25420	agent_2:I watch an occasional NFL game, but I don't pay attention consistently. How do you feel about how influential athletes are? agent_1:Well, they get a lot of coverage, so the advertisers pay for time during the game and to associate their product with them. If there were no commercial interest they would get no money.  agent_2:True, but it makes me miss the days when Michael Jordan was at the top of his game	agent_1:I don't mind LeBron, but I do miss MJ. He really revitalized the game.
158535	agent_2:Wonder why they have them there? You know they still use floppy disk at the White House.  agent_1:I'm curious too. Wow how does they even use floppy disk? So outdated! At least George Bush tried to update it by putting solar panels on the back of the whitehouse. agent_2:Yeah that's a good idea, lead by example right! Do you know who the top 3 richest presidents were? 	agent_1:Exactly. Yes I do actually they were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson. However trumps about to trump that list LOL.
97784	agent_1:Me too. I will say I am not a trump fan though. agent_2:I agree. I was really disappointed with the last election candidates agent_1:I told a friend of mine, that with the entire nation as a candidate pool, those two were the best we could come up with. Makes me sad. We need more and better!	agent_2:I am sure there is a lot of politics in just that alone
77076	agent_1:yes, it is. it is better to get out an exercise. maybe watch a horror movie at the same time? agent_2:Yeah, just throw one of those bikes in front  of your TV and watch the horror film at the same time! Simple. agent_1:exactly. pretend you need to ride away from the horror. LOL So, do you like the internet? or is it the bane of your existence?	agent_2:I like the internet. Did you know that everyone in finland has the right to have internet connection?
158036	agent_1:Nice I have a kid also and she won't be getting a phone for a while. Especially knowing how powerful an iphone is agent_2:The kids don't realize what they have in their hands.  Compared to the space mission the iphone is exponentially more powerful.  Probably just as well that don't know, who knows what they would do with it. agent_1:I agree. The iphone has more computing power than the entire us nuclear icbm detterent. So much power!	agent_2:Yet they are used for selfies and posting to Facebook.  I'm kind of old fashioned, I still listen to good old radio.
27746	agent_2:Hiccups are a spasm of the diaphram muscle, why it starts to spasm, I dont know. agent_1:Well apparently like you said it's from when we were animals and fish. agent_2:Did you know the Loch Ness Monster is a protected species?	agent_1:No protected from what? How's protecting have the world doesn't even believe it exist?
102735	agent_2:I think it was a Disney movie, wasn't it? agent_1:Yeah of all movies it was Bambi agent_2:That's very strange! Horror has been around for over a century.	agent_1:that is a long time. do you know how they make those scary sounds?
29880	agent_2:He does.  He has helped them win back to back titles the last two years.  Looks to be like they are going for a three peat. agent_1:He is the best player on the team but suprisingly he only makes the 5th highest salary on the team agent_2:That is crazy!  Do you know who is above him?	agent_1:I have no clue but that is weird, I though he was the highest paid member on the team, that came as a shock to me as well
13911	"agent_1:How's it going? Did you know that the term ""summit"" wasn't used until 1955? agent_2:Hi, yourself.  No I didn't know that.  I know a summit is a big deal international meeting with lots of heads of state or governments.  Usually you hear about the G20 summit. agent_1:Yea, I'm surprised at the g20 the Canadia PM shook Putin's hand and told him to get out the Ukraine, I would be more stern with Putin if I was there"	agent_2:Ok, it's pretty risky saying that to Putin.  I heard the Russians one time gave out phone chargers and thumb drives that contained trojan viruses out at a G20 summit.
9844	agent_1:do you like jazz music? agent_2:I sure do. Did you know CLint Eastwood is also a huge fan? agent_1:Yes and he also loves the piano too	agent_2:Yes. A woman in harlem hosts free concerts in her apartment every day
20721	agent_2:I think I had heard that before.  It's weird!  I remember reading that there are laws protecting bigfoot in a couple of states agent_1:There are it's crazy!  There are some crazy stats out there too, like there are more pet tigers in the u.s. than there are wild tigers in Asia. agent_2:Yep!  But why would anyone want a pet tiger lol.  why not just a regular cat...who won't kill you!	agent_1:Right! I mean I guess some people like crazy pets. Teddy Roosevelt had something like 20 pets, even a bear and a hyena which is insane.
69077	agent_1:and is volleyball popular in north korea? agent_2:Yeah, very popular volleyball player and supreme leader of north korea. agent_1:Michael jordan is currently the owner and chairman of the charlotte hornets	agent_2:Okay, Buy i don't know that information.
70237	agent_2:I guess thats fair, some people treat animals in a really bad way, you can take pets away from bad guardians.  agent_1:Seems like a sort of weird rule to me, to be honest.  agent_2:It is a weird rule, Roosevelt had more than 20 pets, he had a whole zoo I guess lol	agent_1:Interesting. He must have been really into pets. Well, nice chatting.
61310	agent_1:Do you use YouTube? agent_2:I love using youtube, it is my second favorite search engine behind google, how about you? agent_1:Its also the second most popular search engine out there, I do use it, Google owns the company so that explains the success of the company	agent_2:that makes sense! I never knew Google owned it, I wonder how much they bought it for and when
42421	agent_2:Do you like cars? agent_1:I like cadillacs, I never knew they were named after Antonine de la Mothe Cadillac agent_2:And apparently this guy founded Detroit, strange. Do you know why the drive thru was invented? 	agent_1:yea US soldiers weren't allowed to leave their cars while wearing fatigues, seems like a weird rule
84804	agent_2:I saw that Nintendo was discontinued in Japan in 2003.  agent_1:Really, I guess that makes sense if the Playstation is made there and much more popular. agent_2:Yep definitely. I saw that Ceasar bred chickens not for food, but for entertainment.	agent_1:What kind of entertainment can a chicken provide?
2835	agent_2:Pretty good, on top of their division last year, but no where as good as the Red Sox.  They had an amazing start to the year, and then they won the World Series. agent_1:Holy crap, nice. Probably fat bonuses for everybody... but hey... if they made their fans happy, why the heck not... they earned it ! agent_2:They did.  It was almost too easy.  They have great pitchers, good hitters, and a new manager.  Normally, a new manager isn't a help, but he was from the team who won the World Series the year before, The Houston Astros.	agent_1:Huh... do You think he knows a secret for winning World Series ? ;)  idk... I think it's just a well paid team ;)
78709	agent_2:I know the military also recommends Starship Troopers as well. Interestingly both of those books were made into movies. agent_1:I've seen Ender's Game. It is a fantastic movie and has a fantastic cast as well. agent_2:I did catch a little bit of that movie but did not watch all of it. Starship Troopers was a fun movie.	agent_1:I've never seen that one.  From what I understand though they are about aliens but very different takes on the subject.
125169	agent_2:Do you know where to find the site to participate in Unicef's clean water program? agent_1:I don't but wish I could because I would love to give a child a day of clean water in exchange for every minute I'm not on my cell phone. agent_2:I would too. It's amazing that the iphone has more computing power than the nuclear icbm deterrent. Well, that is frightening, anyway.	agent_1:That's a lot of power in our pockets. lol  Do you still use phone books?  It's impossible to seperate 2 phonebooks that simply have their pages overlapped together.  I don't use them anymore but they keep dropping them off all the time.
23744	agent_1:Yes, great film. i really enjoyed it. spooky, supernatural stuff. directors cut is good. agent_2:No one involved in filming it thought it would be considered a horror film. I wonder how in the world they thought that? agent_1:That is an odd conclusion. i guess they thought it was a love story. satanic love story.	agent_2:I'm not sure what they thought they were filming. Did you also know that the writer of Rocky Horror voices the dad on Phineas and Ferb?
11024	agent_1:It was actually really good. I liked lady luck! Do you like comedy films? agent_2:I do like them yea, one of my favorite actors is Bill Murray agent_1:Me too, I love me some Bill Murray movies, have you seen Kung Fu Hustle?	agent_2:I have seen it yeah, why do you ask?
154991	agent_1:wow, that is amazing! i love that line, it makes it so easy to see how far they have to go. I used to think it was real as a kid lol agent_2:Thats funny lol, so what are your thoughs on QB? I think they are the most important player on the team agent_1:I like a good quarterback and a smart one, have  you heard of alex smith?	agent_2:Yeah I have seen him play, never knew he was a smart person as well
84350	agent_1:The telephone have microphone to speak and earphone to reproduce the sound in the distance location. agent_2:Such a great invention. Who invented the telephone>? agent_1:In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell.	agent_2:That was a long time ago,  good for him,  he basically changed everything by inventing it
69944	agent_2:Are those the same as the Academy Awards or different? agent_1:Yeah the same thing, I think the oscar is the nickname for the actual awards they give out.  agent_2:Oh, interesting. I am not too familiar with actors but Daniel Day Lewis is the only actor to have won the Oscars three times.	agent_1:Yeah he sure has, I wonder what 3 roles he has played.  Maybe Gangs of New York, he was excellent in that.
116462	"agent_2:they never participate in anything again, life included agent_1:Oh my gosh. I see this bit..""choreographed as it may have been, it was a stunning display of fervor that evoked chilling reminders of the mass rallies of the Third Reich agent_2:was literally re-reading that part, how scary to be there and see what looks like the rise of nazism again. "	agent_1:It just gives me chills. I wouldn't want to go to North Korea. Are Americans even allowed to go there?
131365	agent_1:That is so much, probably everything other than Reno, Las Vegas, and Carson City! I wonder what they do with that land? agent_2:I think that is where they do all the Air Force testing of the experimental planes. Also where they hid the aliens, Ha Ha! agent_1:That is what I was thinking too! The government sure do keep secrets. Like Trumps actual weight and how much he is worth! LOL	agent_2:I never thought about wanting to know his weight! Speaking of secrets, isn't it funny that a guy sold the Eiffel tower TWICE! I can't imagine someone thinking it was actually for sale. I wonder how much he made off that swindle!
21091	agent_1:I can understand that. YouTube and Netflix both account for half the peak internet traffic in north America, unfortunately.  agent_2:When I was a kid we didn't have it. We went outside to play. The rule was you had to come in as soon as the street lights went on because kids didn't have cell phones with clocks.  agent_1:Oh wow! Yeah it seems a lot has changed over the years! A lot of kids now like to watch YouTube it seems. Luckily videos that are inappropriate for minors are only available to users who affirm to be at least 18.	agent_2:But no one pays attention to that rule, I bet. I always feel that fresh air and friends are better than any technology when you're growing up, anyway.
41750	"agent_2:well old cars had wooden trunks in the back to carry their stuff, and the name just kind of stuck I guess agent_1:Oh yeah, where I live, we ""bar"" the door, because in olden times,  you would use a bar to jam the door so no one would enter.  agent_2:haha ah ok that also makes some sense, have you ever played the videogame gran tourismo btw? for the playstation"	agent_1:I did play 20 years ago. It did not made me a better driver, the cars would not take damage.
57012	agent_1:No I didn't know that! What is your favorite animal by the way? I really like dogs, and apparently a lot of animals get white patches on their heads when they're domesticated, maybe that's why dogs have patches like that agent_2:Birds. I'm addicted to watch birds. Wish I could see something awesome like the extinct Dodo. agent_1:I do like birds myself. I like to eat them haha. Chickens are delicious, it's sad that the dodo bird is extinct though, but apparently they are related to pigeons, so maybe we can clone them one day	agent_2:Well we still got a lot of really awesome birds. Like Humingbirds. Did you know they steal spiderwebs to make their nests?
65758	agent_1:Yeah I like to travel a lot so I try to learn as much as I can. Do you travel much? agent_2:I try to go away, but I am still beaten by my garden gnome!    It was taken a year ago and has been dozens of places. agent_1:Haha, did you kno wthe dutch on working on making a bus that goes 160 mph?	agent_2:I did not know that.     Ironic, since air travel is actually slower than it was in the 1960s.
79581	agent_1:that's right... that's why I will never trust that technology... agent_2:I'm on the fence, but lean towards not trusting AI when there are so many variables agent_1:THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I THINK ! Plus all the fun in driving... I'm not giving that away...	agent_2:Great point!  I often wonder what the true aim of AI is, most people are already antisocial & glued to their screens
122206	agent_2:Lincoln was a great president, was the first to be photographed for inauguration.  His assassin was also in the photo ironically enough. agent_1:I had not heard that Booth was in the picture.   agent_2:Its kind of creepy, to think of what would happen in just a few years.	"agent_1:""A Turkey in the theater"" is what they call a disaster that can't be saved.  That might have been the greatest ""turkey in any theater"" of all time."
121119	agent_2:Well there is the Redskins.  Actually I like the other football, the one played with the foot.  They have a team called DC United. agent_1:i always thought Washington Redskins was Washington state, huh. I like both Football and American Football. I played football (soccer) when I was much younger agent_2:I too played soccer but was not too great.  Started playing again when I was in my thirties, in, of all places, Alexandria Virginia.  Used to play pick up games along the Potomac.	agent_1:that sounds like such a nice setting to play in!
21659	agent_1:You're right. Do you know the first came to travel around the world was. It was the king of Hawaii! At least he didn't have to pay for gas agent_2:Wow, that is so interesting, I wonder what he all thought on that first trip.  agent_1:I know right. Have you ever been to Iceland? I guess they mostly use airplanes and not cars when they travel between different cities	agent_2:No I haven't, a close friend of mine has and the pictures were incredible!
161231	agent_2:Yeah and he hasn't played a regular season game since 2011.  agent_1:Thats a long time, maybe the team hasnt realiazed that yet lol or he has a really good contract agent_2:Yeah sure is nice to have options lol. Kellan moore is the only left handed QB in the league currently.	agent_1:The only one in the league? I wonder if being a leftie is somehow a disadvantage to the game.
86661	agent_1:I actually had no idea she was the president of young republicans. I also didn't realize she was a lawyer until recently. agent_2:She also has a grammy. agent_1:I heard she had a grammy because of an audio book, but to be honest I never listened to it.	"agent_2:Me either. It's called ""It Takes A Village""."
58853	agent_1:We need to learn how to harness all this available energy and heat! agent_2:Yeah I think they are trying to with solar power. Itss just not there yet.  agent_1:Did you know the sun is actually white?	agent_2:I didnt. Why is that.
63907	agent_1:Not really I like comedies but sometimes I enjoy dramas too agent_2:Do you follow baseball? agent_1:From time to time. Did you know the managers wear uniforms?	agent_2:Yes I did, although I am not a huge baseball fan.
91484	agent_2:Yes I did. Did you know it only has 54 colors agent_1:Yes and too bad it was discontinued in 2003 in Japan agent_2:Yeah I know. Do you know who Bil Nye is?	agent_1:Yes that is the science guy. DO you know how he became famous?
30360	agent_1:I think his the biggest weapon the Warriors have, his been on the team for a long time,  agent_2:well its interesting because even though he is amazing and was the 2015 mvp, he was only the 4th highest salary on the team agent_1:The 4th highest salary! wow! I though he was the best paid player, he is the best in the team so that would make sense	agent_2:ya for sure, funny too that he didn't get any scholarship offers, I wonder if he wasn't that good out of high school or if they overlooked him
120602	agent_1:He must if he released 3 pop albums instead of one, he must be topping the charts in Indonesia agent_2:I bet that he is pretty good, but does it help if you're president? Can you hire the best composers, musicians and producers?  agent_1:Well if you're the type of president who is also a dictator you can	agent_2:Would you get more votes with a good pop album? Is that the way to get the support of the people? Or should I release rap albums?
46489	agent_1:i think that the fix was in on that one. how did they beat Seinfeld? agent_2:You know, I watched a few eps of that and never really got the appeal of that show.  Or Friends for that matter... maybe I just wasn't in the right demographic, I don't know.   agent_1:I guess there are many types of humor and we each have our own. Anyway, great chat!	agent_2:Course, you want to talk comedy, you gotta go back to SHakespeare.  His stuff originated a lot of the words and tropes we see today..
80000	agent_1:Exactly. The design of the shoe has varied greatly through time and from culture to culture. agent_2:They have changed a lot I agree, I feel sorry for ballet dancers, they spend a fortune in shoes agent_1:Yes up to 4 pairs in a week? Seems like they could make them a bit more durable...	agent_2:I know right, maybe its not in the shoe company interest, one strange fact is that 5000 year old shoes perform better than new ones
141259	agent_2:ya I watch it sometimes, I read the site ign.com every day for videogame stuff, and they are apparently owned by fox news agent_1:I wonder how many other channels are owned by them. They even considered making a channel that would only play episodes of the Simpsons agent_2:haha Id watch that, weird though that fox news co-creator was Richard Nixon, didn't know that	agent_1:And the other creator was a Republican media strategist. Was Nixon still President at the time it was created?
43018	agent_2:Yeah, bit of a conservationist.  Just like the Norwegians, they donated a billion dollars to the amazon rain forest once. agent_1:That is a  lot of money. On the other hand the US government has really shifted their focus towards protecting their employees from prosecution if they violate geneva conventions agent_2:I wonder if it's against the Geneva Convention to see national monuments.  A man in France pretended to work for the government and sold the Eiffel Tower, not once but twice!	agent_1:That is just insane, wow. Do you know when the White HOuse started getting used as a president's house?
121233	agent_2:That is an achievement!  agent_1:thats incredible. Did you know Humans may have lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago agent_2:Perhaps they didn't need it with the discovery of fire and the creation of clothing.	agent_1:Yeah probably just adapting to the environment.
19920	agent_1:Yes, that did sound really good. I like small plates. agent_2:Yes have you been to Spain?  Their tapas are amazing. agent_1:I've never been. I'd like to. I've eaten Spanish food, but not in Spain.	agent_2:Yes.  I would rather eat tapas for sure rather than have to discuss rap artists!  How boring
4323	agent_1:I don't know, the Cubs were founded the same year as the Battle of Little Bighorn so maybe it has something to do with the times agent_2:That's a fun fact! I also hear they're called the North Siders because of where Wrigley Field is and The White Sox has their field on the South Side of Chicago. Have you ever been there? agent_1:No but I'd love to visit Wrigley field, it is one of the most historic baseball parks	agent_2:I hear that it's a really nice place and the culture is cool there too. In example, when the visitors hit a homer into the bleachers the cubs fans throw it back into the field! lol I'd like to see that.
127754	agent_1:Yup do that for sure. And if you go to Iceland make sure you rent a car there or just fly a lot agent_2:Did you know the dutch creating a commuter bus designed to travel 160 mph? I don't think I want to travel on a bus with that king of speed? agent_1:I actually want to try that. Do you know who the first king to travel the world was?	agent_2:Yes If I am right, the first king name Kalakaua, I didn't know there are kings in hawaii, guess I never thought about it.
16826	agent_1:Wonder if that was a tactic he used to bash each other. It's too bad that despite his progressive views, young people vote at significantly lower rates that older voters and in Texas that could be a bad thing for O'Rourke agent_2:Yea, apparently baby boomers don't like rock music or long hair agent_1:Maybe they like beards, because every US president with a beard has been a republican.	agent_2:Yea and since 1928 every republican ticket has had a Bush or it too, or a Nixon
63017	agent_1:nope I'd agree with Paris hilton too, I don't see her appeal, do you know who Carol Burnett was? agent_2:I think I've heard of her but don't know too much. Who is she? agent_1:she had a variety show in the 70's, but she was actually the first guest on Sesame street	agent_2:Oh wow, that must have boosted her career for sure! It's interesting how people start out, like Jenna Marble is a celebrity just from making YouTube videos.
130800	agent_1:no, I do not know much about politics. But this article is helping me learn some things, My first article is about Michael Cohen with regards to president trump agent_2:Yeah I guess they are everywhere in the news. Do you know who are the three wealthiest presidents in the US? agent_1:yes JFK, Washington, and Jefferson	agent_2:Yeah. The president of Indonesia is a pop star on top of being a president
96101	agent_2:It was some of the best stuff.  I wonder how the album was from the japanese twins who released it when they were 100 agent_1:Right!  I think that is so cool they did that, but yeah I wonder what it sounds like.  agent_2:It is probably one of a kind.  lol	agent_1:Yeah I'm sure it is, I bet their grandchildren think they are the coolest ever as well!
51122	agent_2:I bet you are right.  I can't believe that the Green Lantern was conceived as a comedy with Jack Black. agent_1:That would have been a mess, the movie was already bad as is. agent_2:I agree. I would rather play my old NES with its 54 colors. 	agent_1:54 colors! that doesn't seem like much although at time it was an incredible thing. I also like to play Nintendo
156792	agent_1:Wouldn't be as fun as Indonesia, where the president has a decent pop career and three albums. agent_2:I reckon that he made a law that folks had to buy thealbums or they would get arrested. agent_1:Why do you say that?	agent_2:I think that the President of Indonesia is probably a dictator. He wants to make money so he gets people to buy his album...or else.
26806	agent_1:I would think so. Imagine hearing a car alarm go off miles from ant road. agent_2:I think it's cute that hummingbirds will steal spiderwebs, to repair their nests. I've never witnessed that behavior though. agent_1:Neither have I. I do get to watch eagles every fall when the salmon runs start.	agent_2:That would be fun to watch. I recently learned that there was a group of birds (now extinct) that didn't have wings. How odd.
35494	agent_2:ah thats cool, ya I guess that comic is set in the future about a retired superman, that sounds interesting agent_1:yeah, I am sure he was tring to send a message to new rappers with that agent_2:true, hav eyou ever heard the song California Gurls by snoop dogg and katie perry	agent_1:yeah and didn't they do it a a west coast reply to jay z and alicia keys empire state of mind
162889	agent_2:I know South Park was very critical of Family Guy which in turn was critical of the Simpsons, probably why they sent flowers. agent_1:Did you know there are 750 episodes of pokemon? agent_2:I did not, I watched a couple when I was younger but it does not surprise me that it is a very popular show.	agent_1:my kids watched it. No wonder I thought it was endless!
99415	agent_1:Interesting how it said jfk was one of the wealthiest, I would've expected someone like FDR or Donald Trump.  agent_2:Yes, I think that goes to show how little we truly know about what presidents really are like outside of the oval office. The president of Zimbabwe being named Banana made me laugh though.  agent_1:I just saw that and nearly died laughing, you think President Banana was a good president? 	agent_2: I actually didn't know the thing about the vice president being the runner up before 1805, I was surprised I had no idea of that.
90442	agent_2:I am sure he thought he was just ordering a book or something... That would be a neat surprise though. agent_1:It would be.  I do like how Amazon contracted with the US postal service to deliver Amazon packages on Sundays.  That was nice to get some of my packages before Christmas like that. agent_2:The USPS has nothing else to do on Sundays so why not! They also own IMDB. 	agent_1:lol True!  Plus they are hurting to stay afloat so Amazon is probably helping them in that respect.
99566	agent_2:I'll send you the link it is pretty good. A lot of low end stuff though. Nothing with Hugh Laurie or any big time actors. He makes 700k per episode! agent_1:Ok sounds good - thanks! I can't believe he makes that much per episode. He's the highest paid actor for drama TV. agent_2:It's interesting that comedy actors get paid so much more. I guess it's that much more popular.	agent_1:I agree. Michael Caine became an actor because all of the prettiest girls were in drama class at his school.
116409	agent_2:The President minimizes his time there anyway, it seems like he's off golfing at one of his courses every other weekend! Even if he has money, he's still not one of the top 3 wealthiest Presidents, which were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson. agent_1:I found list sketchy too.  You mean to tell me a Bush, Clinton, or Trump didn't make the list of the top three wealthiest presidents? agent_2:I think it's adjusted for inflation--the Clintons claim they left office in debt because of all their legal fees, although they're certainly capitalized since then through speaking engagements and books deals. 	agent_1:Yes, they have capitalized well.  Not to change the subject or anything, but did you know that Bruce Lee was such a great dancer?
75189	agent_1:Yes,  very entertaining,  it does generate a lot of money as well.  agent_2:yeah, the money cant be kept out the game, and the money changes everything. agent_1:Tim duncan sacrificed money and stayed in college instead of going straight to the nba.	agent_2:i would not have made the same decision. i would take the money. too many risks of injury.
116059	agent_1:He might not, but if people do, it will definitely be due to him! agent_2:Yeah, i figure that NASA is too slow. maybe the Chinese will get there first. i dont know. agent_1:It will be like the Space race to the moon all over again.	agent_2:Yes, the govt might finally take this stuff seriously! Anyway, great chat!
26730	agent_2:Yes.     If Google is willing to pay nearly 2 billion dollars to own you, something is going right! agent_1:Yes, and they have Google to thank for their success now too. Guess what's the most disliked video on YouTube? agent_2:I heard it was Justin Bieber.    Maybe kids didn't appreciate his dance skills.	"agent_1:Yes! ""Baby"" by Justin Bieber."
3659	agent_1:Well the fees are getting high on some airlines! I wonder how much it happens that a label says made somewhere, but is really made elsewhere like with Rip Curl? agent_2:Probably a lot. Did you know at Billy Mays funeral the pallbearers wore blue shirts and khakis? agent_1:I would love to see a gang in America layer shirts with popped collars like they did in China!	agent_2:Lol, sounds better than Mark Zuckerburgs plain shirts that cost $300-$400
112483	"agent_1:Oh, but it continues!  There's also a Fantasy Congress.  Supposed draft members and get points based on legislative success... (guessing like what bills get passed and stuff...) agent_2:That's weird. Probably a good way to introduce congress and bills in HS civics... agent_1:Yeah.  Personally, though, my ""Fantasy"" congress would be one that can put aside petty politics long enough to do what's right for the country. "	agent_2:I agree. I would like a few non-partisan bills and possibly a nice laugh or cordiality.
9046	agent_2:Far out - in time, that is. Brilliant guy, though. Has vision. Even named a building on Amazon's Seattle campus after his 1st Amazon customer! Why not? agent_1:That is neat!  IMDB is also owned by Amazon since 1998. agent_2:Yes. Whether it's Amazon (big, powerful warriors) or Alibaba (magical) the AI these giants employ is beyond me. How about you?	agent_1:AI scares me.  lol  I don't trust it.  It's been a good chat.
92294	agent_1:Yea for sure, Well its been good talking to you, take care! agent_2:Thanks so much! I need to watch a comedy movie now lol, have a great day! agent_1:bye!	agent_2:bye
19712	agent_1:Yea, it was set in a snowy hotel I think. Did you hear what horror films do for abstract art? agent_2:Let me guess. After viewing blood, guts, torture and gore, the art actually looks good!? agent_1:Yes lol! I don't know what it triggers in the brain, but it happens! Do you like Rock music?	agent_2:Sure, even though it's always been connected to violence in some ways. Concerts turned bloody when stands collapse; premature deaths of some rock greats...
149770	agent_2:How rowdy do the fans get? I have never attended a live football game but would love to attend one but it's surprising to find out that 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums belong to college football teams! agent_1:They must have done enough to get the security in.  One team in 1965 kept playing football even while their science building was burning down behind them.  I wonder if anybody was inside of the building? agent_2:I hope not, that sounds dangerous. The huddle used in today's games actually resulted from a deaf quarterback to prevent other teams from reading his hand signals	agent_1:That was genius!  Did you know not many quarterbacks are left-handed?  Kellan Moore is the only one in the NFL.
7956	agent_1:Hello,  did you every us president with a beard has been republican? agent_2:Hi. I just read that, and find that to be pretty funny! That's one of those facts that is fun but meaningless.  agent_1:lol yup useless information.  Just like there hasnt been a us president who wasnt rep or dem since 53.	agent_2:So I guess that last time there was a third party candidate that was successful was over 150 years ago. I wonder what the name of the party was? That was just before the civil war, unless I have forgotten my dates.
161463	agent_2:absolutely.  The government should be very involved in the enviornment agent_1:In Nevada 86% of the land in Nevada is owned by the US Government. I hope they are taking good care of it. agent_2:Its probably all the military bases and stuff. 	agent_1:Yes, I bet you are right.
16651	agent_1:Haha yeah during the Gupta empire actually. agent_2:Yeah. DO you like SPiderman? agent_1:I love the movies. Do you know why it has a hyphen in the name?	agent_2:Yes so it can be distinguished from Superman as they sound similar
164719	agent_1:Yes, i see a lot of graphics on the field now. quite useful for the viewers.  agent_2:Football has come a long way. Financially as well. Professional bowlers use to make twice as much as players agent_1:I think the football players made very little, so I don't know how much the bowlers made. Anyway, great chat!	agent_2:I wonder if a pink locker room actually has an effect on players
147561	agent_1:Yes they are! In my opinion the government is corrupt! agent_2:Like the man in France who impersonated a government official, and managed to sell the Eiffel tower not once, but twice? He *should* have worked for the government, he was that crooked! agent_1:I agree with you about that. Lol Sometimes, government does good though.  The Norwegian government donated a billion dollars to save the rainforest in the Amazon.	agent_2:That's great! I think they understand that the future requires investment. In contrast, the US passed legislation that would protect government employees from being prosecuted for violating the Geneva conventions.
149093	agent_1:IS it donald trump, lol. Who is it? agent_2:I'm not sure, but I know he was appointed by the United Nations. agent_1:sounds like an episode of south park!	agent_2:It does! It was nice talking with you!
72918	agent_1:Yes it was a couple and they schedule 2430 games each year agent_2:Yeah impressive. Did you hear a guy found a bunch of old baseball cards and made a fortune off of them? agent_1:Yeah he made 3 million, great find in the attic	agent_2:Do you use your phone much?
98279	agent_1:I'm surprised to hear that. I'm used to not getting service in places like that. Sometimes I don't even get service in high rise buildings. But I guess the internet has gotten more essential in our world agent_2:it has for sure. it has become so important that the library of alexandria has saved a copy of it in case it burns dowm agent_1:I can't even imagine the internet burning down. Did you know the 3 line horizontal menu is called the hamburger button? I never knew that but I can see how it looks like one.	agent_2:Yeah I did not know that either. do you know what percentage of people read the full terms when buying online?
61827	agent_2:I do not, I just use the default ones on my android phone actually what about you? agent_1:Me either, but apparently phone companies pay a lot of attention to the ringtones that they offer to us to ensure they get our attention. agent_2:ya I guess there is a luxury phone maker that uses the london symphony orchestra for their ringtones, I wonder what those sound like	agent_1:I do not know. That must cost a lot of money. Nice chatting with you, have a good one.
138744	agent_1:I guess there's a lot of politics about his tweet in regards to supporting someone agent_2:yeah, he's not supposed to do politics on the  taxpayers dime. like he shouldnt use af1 to go to a campaign rally agent_1:The mix of politics and policy is a more modern issue that's come to a light a lot more since his Presidency	agent_2:yeah, it now costs 206K / hour to run AFOne. So its no joke
31901	agent_2:I agree it's scary. When Earth first formed, a day was only 5.5 hours long. agent_1:Sounds like a mid winters day in the midwest. agent_2:Definitely. Do you know Jupiter has a moon called Ganymede that would be a planet if it orbited the sun?	agent_1:That's crazy. The earth isnt exactly big out there!
139590	agent_1:Me either, but I do remember Rob base.  agent_2:I think it's interesting how rap occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing. Who was Rob Base?  agent_1:He was a rapper in the 80s. A long time before Busta Rhymes. 	agent_2:Oh nice. I will have to look him up. One thing I envy about rappers is their nice cars. I have never seen one with a flamethrower though. Would have to go to South Africa for that!
50432	agent_2:That is amazing! there is also this theory that we might exist inside of a black hole agent_1:That is interesting too. How about the theory that only one electron exists in the universe? A bit out there if you ask me. agent_2:Thats a weird theory but who know maybe its right, the more we learn about the universe the more questions we have about it	agent_1:Yeah exactly and sometimes the most craziest theories are correct. Earth will be virtually helium free by the end of this century!
111734	"agent_2:That's impressive in 5 different languages, he must be a really smart man and I heard O'Brother, Where Art Thou is certified 8 times platinum agent_1:""I am a man of constant sorrows...""  Love that track!  Did you know that the President of Indonesia release three pop albums while in office? I doubt those will go platinum! agent_2:He did? didn't he have a country to run lol, "	agent_1:Apparently he felt their country was suffering from a shortage of pop music.  I wonder if his VP was on the album too?  Did you know that before 1805, in the US, the VP was always just the runner up n the election? If that was true today, VP Clinton could do a duet on Trump's album!
101775	agent_2:Yeah, it is pretty crazy. What about My Space passing up on a chance to buy it at 75 million. I bet they wish they would have now. agent_1:Agree. it shows the confidence face book founders had agent_2:Yeah, it's a good thing they held on to it because now it is worth 414 billion	"agent_1:the facts provided in the articles were worth reading. For instance, Lot of folks don't know ""like"" button is illegal in one of the german states"
75805	agent_1:Maybe he wanted to show everyone what he made? and also The first amazon.com customer spent $27.95 and got a building named after him agent_2:Maybe.  I told you earlier. I found that cool. agent_1:Do you love concerts? As we know A concert is a live music performance in front of an audience	agent_2:Sure. Have you been in one of Linkin Park concerts? They played 324 concerts in 2001.
149762	agent_2:I actually am not a Notre Dame fan, but judging from that winning record, I think I am convinced. Do you think its because of luck or skill? agent_1:Dexter Williams ran a 45 yard drive to make a touchdown for them in a victory, but came off a suspension of four games.  I'm not sure why he was suspended but that can't help the team to have players with that happening to them. agent_2:Maybe it's because of drug related issues, I was recently reading another news article about football player who was suspended because of that. Do you have a favorite college football team?	agent_1:I like Penn State, but I think it would be fun to visit the University of Iowa with my daughter.  It might just inspire her to play football in college as they painted their locker room for the visiting team pink.
24090	agent_1:lol Huge loss on their part now.  And cheap too,  $25 mil for all the characters,  that's nothing in the movie business.   agent_2:Exactly, huge loss! There is one character that both Marvel and DC own agent_1:yeah,  I have never seen that character before lol It is really nice that a lot of the Marvel movies are available on netflix now! 	agent_2:So many people use Netflix! I didn't realize they have been around since 1997!
100291	agent_1:I think it is in South Africa, that's funny. agent_2:wow,  thats horrible,  its already crazy hot there and then you got flame throwers on cars.   agent_1:That's right, crazy.  Well, it's been nice chatting with you, I need to go walk my dog.  I'll talk to you later, friend.	agent_2:good chatting with you too.
12582	agent_2:I didn't know that!  Do you think rap is our modern poetry? agent_1:Wow, I did not know that. That does sound about right though. Did you know that ancient Grecians concentrated on the features of poetry such as repetition and uses of speech.  agent_2:Yes, they tried to distinguish it from more objectively informative and  prosaic forms of writing.	agent_1:Yeah, exactly. I would argue that ancient people were much more driven and intellectual than modern civilization.
23070	agent_2:Well it had a lot of influence. James Cameron quit his truck driving job to make movies after seeing it.  agent_1:that is great I love James Cameron, he directed Terminator, Terminator 2, true lies, so many great movies! agent_2:Yes and Aliens which I love. He is great. George Lucas says that the Star Wars story we are seeing is told by R2D2 about a 100 years after Return of the Jedi.	agent_1:well that is interesting, I think its crazy that darth vader is so iconic but all his lines were recorded for the first movie in about 3 hours
99944	agent_2:Yeah! You think the name is what makes it embarrassing for the masculine players to use it? Even physicists have proved that granny style is the best technique! agent_1:Yeah exactly. Do you watch much tv? agent_2:Yes, I enjoy watching TV, my favorite genre to watch are dramas, how about you?	agent_1:Yeah I like them. Did you ever watch House?
13061	agent_1:Exactly. I think voting should be changed somehow. But we all know it won't happen. Just like in 2012...in 9 states voters were blocked from the polls. agent_2:How could that happen in the US? i feel like the country is going backwards. in Alabama, many black men cant vote. Isnt this a human right? we dont have enough people voting as it is. agent_1:I agree 100%. We as a country seem to be going through some very crazy times right now and God only knows what will happen in our future. Not much makes sense. But for some Indians, their government set up a strange polling booth in a forest full of lions! 	agent_2:I think there is an obligation there for the govt to reach out to the people and make sure that they can vote. I wish the polls were handled better in the US
122529	"agent_1:While our most expensive possession is usually a house, most of the people there have a most expensive possession of an Uzi.  It is scary. agent_2:Yeah that's crazy, and you said you been over there? agent_1:Yes.  And we were told ""Do not take a cab from the airport""  We had to be picked up by someone we knew.  At the time, 20% of the population was HIV positive."	agent_2:Wow... So  that whole flame-thrower being legal is true?
162813	agent_2:I have not, Is he a singer?	agent_1:I think he tried to be, but he is a country radio host. He's pretty good. I would compare him to Howard Stern.
8293	agent_1:I guess he was good at telling stories. I never knew that. He was quite a leader. I guess I should check out his works. agent_2:Yes, he was half American and half British!  agent_1:Yes, I believe he got honorary citizenship or something. I dont remember. Anyway, great chat!	agent_2:Yes, have a good night!! Good chat!
158408	agent_2:or the guest house which is bigger than WHite House agent_1:Agreed. But then who would keep the president in check? agent_2:LOL, that is a good point. I don't think he's very smart	agent_1:At least he's smarther than the fact that the white house still uses floppy disks for storing files!
159675	agent_1:He must not have had much work to do if he had the time to record even one pop album, right? agent_2:I agree!!! Do you happen to know who the top three wealthiest presidents were in American history? agent_1:I do! I think they were JFK, Washington and Jefferson. I wonder how Trump fits in there now	agent_2:Yeah!! Me too. I wonder that as well.
147681	agent_2:I can't imagine how a radio storm may sound! must be a lot of noise! agent_1:It occured in Jupiter so only we hear the noise. agent_2:Hahaha, It's not music from heavens! it is Noise from outer space.	agent_1:Sure! There is website you can listen to drama freely. In the early stage we use radio to hear the football score. Its very interesting.
35933	agent_1:That makes sense. What genre do you tend to watch on netflix? agent_2:I have lately been watching a lot of documentaries. They have had some fascinating true crime ones lately. agent_1:Really? I tend to watch more comedies	agent_2:Do you have any good comedy recommendations on Netflix? I've watched a few standup specials they have aired.
132473	agent_2:annoying so far: ) I'm waiting for UPS to deliver my boxes and they keep rescheduling ;) how was Yours ? agent_1:fine agent_2:any subject we will talk about ? 	agent_1:talk about the telephone
78216	agent_1:I  do like Youtube, along with google its the other search engine I use the most. agent_2:Yeah, pretty hand for so many things now. Cute story about the first video they uploaded, the guy with the elephant  agent_1:I didnt know about that video, but I do know police have their own version its called blutube	agent_2:Oh that is cool. I love that they have the Bob Ross painting episodes in there
127530	agent_2:Oh yea,  on a daily basis,  love youtube.  How about you? agent_1:I like it as well did you know its the second largest search engine out there? agent_2:Yes I did.  I think the first is Google. 	agent_1:Yeah Google is #1, well Google also owns YouTube, they bought the company back in 2006
138588	agent_1:Yeah I wouldnt like to be remembered by a nickname like that one, did you know that until 1805 the runner up of a presidential election became the vice president? agent_2:No I didn't know that but it is a really good idea! agent_1:I can see it working, I wonder why it got changed.	agent_2:I don't know.  Our government is odd and secretive. I mean, did you know that they own 86% of the land in Nevada?
17374	agent_1:Eddie Perfect? Who is that? I have seen the movie Beetlejuice. agent_2:He was an Australian composer who ended up writing the music for the Broadway adaptation of the movie. Really interesting story there. agent_1:I did not know that. I guess he must have done other stuff as well. 	agent_2:Oh yeah. He also wrote songs for King Kong the musical! Can you imagine how weird that show must have been ha ha?
150807	agent_2:Nice! I'm guessing maybe a Philly fan? I am a Packers fan, so it's been some years but was still nice winning one in 2010.  agent_1:Yes I am an Eagles fan. We had a wild ride this season, I'm just happy we made the playoffs. The Super Bowl this year was a lot duller than Super Bowl 52. agent_2:Yeah it was, your team had one of the most exciting super bowls ever!  I was cheering for you for sure!	agent_1:I think a lot of NFL fans were since we were playing the Patriots. Foles really made for a great feel-good story.
145408	agent_1:Maybe so. Have you ever watched pokemon? There are over 750 episodes. agent_2:I used to as a kid back in the day. There were only like 150 pokemon at that time haha. That is like 50 episodes a year for 16 years straight! agent_1:Yes now there are so many! It was a great thing as a kid. Do you like drama? The term Drama is Greek in origin and means action.	agent_2:I do like them. I can't believe how much Hugh Laurie made on House!
61410	agent_1:I have never heard dark side of the moon either.  Where have I been? agent_2:Dark side of the moon came out in like 1967 so if you are young, you can be excused... agent_1:You are kind. Two identical twins from japan released a rap album when they turned 100 years old in 1992.  I'm sure they have passed away by now.	agent_2:Nwa's straight outta compton was the first album to reach platinum status without the support of airplay or a major tour
144717	agent_1:Past years they just one the super ball again, give somebody else  a chance will you! haha agent_2:I think that is why despite being called America's Team, they are also universally hated. agent_1:Right. Hey you the Iowa State university coach had the visiting footballs team locker room painted pink. 	agent_2:I had heard that, as some sort of intimidation tactic.  Seeing as they are not so dominant, I dont think it is working too well
5650	agent_2:Wow, now wouldn't that be something.  I wonder if they will be able to do that with planets further out in the future? agent_1:With all of those companies and a company like Facebook worth over $100 billion I am sure they sky the is the limit. agent_2:Exactly.  Do you use Facebook much?	agent_1:I do.  I cannot believe in 2005 that Myspace turned down an offer to buy Facebook for $75 million!
95575	agent_2:Yeah, and since then it has not been good for the mens team. the women have done well though. agent_1:Thats crazy that soccer makes more money than most american sports put together! agent_2:Yeah, the world loves soccer. men and women, young and old. they all love to watch local and national competition.	agent_1:I had no idea it generated that much money,  that is amazing.  It is also called association football.
158622	agent_1:Good point there. Do you listen to the radio much? agent_2:Daily. I especially like to listen to Finnish radio broadcasts of the news spoken in classical Latin.  Great radio to put you to sleep! agent_1:Haha I guess if you do not speak the language. I want to find that channel that picks up Jupiter's storms	agent_2:Yeah, but it is not a Canadian station. They require 40% of all music played on their stations to be of Canadian origin, and I don't think there is any hockey on Jupiter yet.
75726	agent_1:I didnt know that either I would have thought they met when they were both like 20 years old but i never expected since that young agent_2:I also can't believe Barlow dabbled in GOP politics.  I guess it makes sense if you're a freedom lover.  agent_1:Exactly the dead were very proactive they didn't just lay down stagnant and just talk the talk they went into action	agent_2:Yep, that's true.  Seem like most of their music was live recording too.  Too bad Jerry isn't around.  He would be all over the internet, even more so than now.
142352	agent_2:Yes, they went crazy! They redid that show in Brazil and when they found out it was fake, they stormed the station and burned it down. agent_1:Wow I didn't know that. Have you ever used a foxhole radio? They're made from a pencil and a razor blade. I don't know how that works ahah agent_2:No. I would end up cutting my finger off trying to turn the channel.	agent_1:LOL. Have you ever watched Fox News before? They get more views than CNN and MSNBC
104517	agent_1:Yea and he ended up winning 4 stanley cups so he can't feel that bad about the trade agent_2:Nope I can't either! I'm also happy that instead of having to build two stadiums, you can just swap between a hockey rink and a basketball court agent_1:Yea but I hear that arenas that have both basketball and hockey teams the ice quality isn't as good when under the floor	agent_2:Oh I didn't know that. Do you ever watch games on television by the way?
151749	agent_1:It is Jefferson, Washington and JFK agent_2:Nice. In guatemala the relatives of the president cannot apply for that position ever agent_1:Wow nice rule. Did you know the guest house is larger than the white house	agent_2:Wow nice. Lincoln was the first president to have a picture taken at his inaguration
58593	agent_2:And you are not alone. Video games make more money each year than Hollywood films agent_1:It is amazing how much technology has come to create whole worlds in a 2d screen agent_2:You're right, and technology just keeps getting better. I thought Mortal Kombat was so realistic looking when I first played it. Mortal Kombat is the reason for the video games rating system!	agent_1:That is the one where one character rips out and eats the loser's heart right?
83014	agent_2:That's pretty cool! New York's area code is 212 cause it was easy to dial on old phones.  agent_1:Myspace turned down an offer to buy facebook for $75 million in 2005.  Bet they regret that choice. agent_2:That stinks! I didn't realize facebook has only been around since 2004. 	"agent_1:Facebook's ""like"" button is illegal in schleswig-holstein"
79953	agent_1:Yes they are great! There is something about the sound of a vinyl album that just can't be mimicked by a cd. There is a tone that makes it unique.  agent_2:A lot of people say that, more authentic feel.  Speaking of Pink Floyd, their Dark Side Of The Moon Album was still one of the best selling albums of 2014.  Despite it being over 40 years old.  That's wild! agent_1:That is really surprising! I guess there is just something about their music that speaks to multiple generations which is kind of neat when you think about it. 	agent_2:It is.  My dad actually liked Country music, but collected all genres of music on those vinyl albums.  I used to love as a kid just looking at all the different album covers, they were so neat!
92980	agent_2:I guess it worked out for them, Jim Dutcher and Jaimie, at first it was only him, how can you sleep with them agent_1:With one eye open... Did you ever see that alaskan bear documentary where the guy got eaten along with his girl friend? agent_2:No I didnt catch that one, seems like a terrible way to die	agent_1:Yeah. Really sad. They were breaking up too. She was a casualty of bad timing.
15355	agent_2:That's insane but it's probably much better than the manual cardboard computers Bell distributed to students in 1968 agent_1:No doubt. Also, did you know that in 1936, Russians made a computer that ran on water? No that would be cool to see how that worked. agent_2:That would be a sight. At Stanford the first google computer was housed in a lego enclosures	agent_1:Cool, that's funny.  Did you realize that some transhumanists want to upload their minds to computers and even memory sticks?
35245	agent_2:Then we have Iceland, with no public rail and people taking domestic flights on a regular basis. agent_1:I wouldn't enjoy living in Iceland, I imagine it's quite pricey to travel there if all you use are domestic flights agent_2:I'm not sure about the idea of living on an island in general.	agent_1:I guess that's why King Kalakau of Hawaii decided to travel the world
86756	agent_1:I bet he practiced a lot although he is a really smart man, he has a PHD in astrophysics agent_2:He really is a bright guy! Astronomical! I think that he is one of the few rock star scientists.  agent_1:I know right, not many artists can say that, I loved the group Queen, he uses coins as guitar picks	agent_2:I think he must have gotten a unique sound from them. I guess you try that. I don't know how much it helps a beginner.
83013	agent_1:That's so crazy to imagine!  If you don't use your cell phone, Unicef will donate a day of clean water to a child in need for every minute agent_2:That's pretty cool! New York's area code is 212 cause it was easy to dial on old phones.  agent_1:Myspace turned down an offer to buy facebook for $75 million in 2005.  Bet they regret that choice.	agent_2:That stinks! I didn't realize facebook has only been around since 2004.
93206	agent_1:Wow! He's such a legend that I find that very surprising.  agent_2:Yea I guess Shaq is worse at 3 pointers than he is at free throws agent_1:Apparently. I find it very depressing that in 39 out of 50 states the highest paid state employees are college football or basketball coaches. 	agent_2:Yea that's a shame, plus players leave college to soon, 60% of NBA players are broke five years after retirement
143407	agent_1:I love traveling. Did you know the Dutch are creating a bus that can travel 160mph? agent_2:Whew, that thing goes fast.  Not sure if I'd be riding it. agent_1:Me either lol. To travel across Japan, it would cost roughly $300 in tolls.	agent_2:Actually, I've been to Japan a few times on business, back when I traveled frequently and that's true, all their roads are tolls.
38232	agent_1:I agree with that. Do you use your phone much? agent_2:All the time actually. DO you know why the area code of NY is 212? agent_1:I think it is because it was easy to dial it on a rotary phone right?	agent_2:Yes that was it Did you ever use a phone book as well?
88610	agent_2:That's funny. I mean, it has been proven to be the best technique to score points constantly. I guess NBA players are just afraid of how they would look. agent_1:They might not get million dollar sneaker deals if they do that. agent_2:I think it'd be funny. Maybe I'd watch more games. Haha.	agent_1:High school games at Lebron James' high school actually cost $100-$120.  That sounds extreme.  I wonder if he went to private school?
79299	"agent_2:The show ""weekend update"" is the longest running skit on SNL. agent_1:i havent watched SNL in a long time. SNL = still not laughable. i guess sometimes they are good. i figure that they need new writers. agent_2:The show ""weekend update"" I think naturally is able to last so long because there is so much room for innovation in it.  Also, news is a part of daily life."	agent_1:yes, that is true. making comment on current events can keep the humor current. i dont know who does it now. it used to be dan akroyd long ago.
94165	agent_2:I agree, its something that shouldnt be taken lightly, a divorce is always nasty, specially at that scale agent_1:And it affects those who have retired from Britain who live in Europe. Not to mention access to some bank accounts agent_2:Yeah theres about 250,000 British retiress living in Europe, that will take a toll on them	agent_1:Since it happens officially in the next few weeks, I guess we'll see if the panic is actually legitimate or not
1654	agent_2:Clint eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast, pianist, and scored several films, including million dollar baby. agent_1:Clint Eastwood movies are awesome agent_2:they are/ I like grand Torino especially. what is your fave?	agent_1:That's great one.  Unforgiven was awesome
39875	agent_1:Yes.  It would be kind of neat having a leg like that!  She will even be able to play sports and dance! agent_2:Yeah, she needs special blades to do certain activities.  Her family and friends have donated to cover some of that cost. agent_1:Yes I am glad she can dance - it is such an art form for human movement.  	agent_2:She thinks she might even be able to take part in the paralympics some day.  She would have to travel to attend though.
154364	agent_1:This is so funny. I wonder if they got in trouble?  agent_2:I bet somebody knocked on their doors at some point.  Afterall, the Prime Minister is he head of the cabinet and the leader of the ministers in the executive branch of government. In many systems the Prime Minister selecs and may dismiss other members of the cabinet and they allocate posts to members. They prob dont like pranks. agent_1:Did you know that the president of indonesia has released 3 albums while in office? 	agent_2:What! That's a weird thing for a president to do. I wonder how he had time for that. I like our system and presidents jobs because they don't make music.
29512	agent_2:Wow! I want to go there. I would like to visit the worlds largest collection of comic books! agent_1:I wonder if they address the fact that DC comics is redundant because it stands for detective comics. agent_2:Ah, did you know that the e in chunk e cheese stands for entertainment?	agent_1:That is appropriate since it is an entertaining place of fun! Have a nice evening! Nice meeting you!
112582	agent_1:No I was talking about O' Brother, in the record company studio, but I heard Frozen is good too.  agent_2:Oh ok! Well that was embarrassing haha. It's interesting to read about how all these celebrities dabbled into their careers, like Micahel Caine became an actor because all the prettiest girls were in drama class. I think that totally paid off and is a great motivator. agent_1:No you're fine lol, and yeah I think that is crazy how a small move back then for a different motive turns out to be career shaping. 	agent_2:Haha, thanks but to turn down movies like Jim Carrey did because his belief system prevents him from movies that don't project positivity, that takes a lot of gut
4831	agent_1:That guy is amazing. He played aquaman too. Arya is a good name. short, easy to spell.  agent_2:Yes!  GOT gets financed by Ireland because they film scenes there which boosts tourism incomes.  That makes sense. agent_1:I bet it is the same as LOTR and New Zealand. the locals might get tired of tourists though.	agent_2:Maybe.  I myself would love it. lol  There is a National Geogrpahic wild show called Game of Lions that follows the lives of lions like GOT characters.  lol
43952	agent_1:Yeah well celebrities have tough lives, might seem easy with all the money but sometimes they live lonely lives, do you remember Robin Williams I still cant believe he took his own life agent_2:I know. Sometimes I like to watch Aladdin for his voice acting. He started the trend of celebrities voicing characters in animations agent_1:He left a legacy behind, thats a sure thing I bet he was in Pixars secret room many times	agent_2:Judge Judy has probably been in there too, even if she would never admit to it. She's the highest paid celebrity after LeBron James because she earns $123,000 per episode
122473	agent_2:I never knew apple made a clothing line,  I wonder what kind of clothes they sold.  agent_1:I didn't know that either.  I bet that stuff is worth some money now.  There is a store in Alabama that sells only clothes and other items found in unclaimed baggage at airports.  Maybe they have some Apple clothing? lol agent_2:Maybe,  that seems like a good business,  I bet they get a lot of good stuff in left over luggage. 	agent_1:I know right?  Fashion aficionados look for collar gaps in clothes to tell you get your clothes tailored or not.  They would laugh at my clothes.
18441	agent_2:I agree and suppose he did! On a related note, I think it's also fascinating both Haydn and Mozart owned a piano made from the exact same tree. Would I love to get my hands on either of those pianos! agent_1:That's amazing! I guess the tree had some magic in its boughs. agent_2:I'm sure it did. I'd also like to get my hands on one of the first typewriters that was made as it was at first called a literary piano, oddly enough. 	agent_1:Hm. I guess we're writing a duet right now, then, huh?
135401	Did you know Ronald Reagan once got turned down for a role because he didn't have a presidential look?  How ironic. lol agent_1:I bet that casting agent was embarrassd his entire presidency.	agent_2:Yes.  lol  I have to get running.  It was nice chatting with you!  Have a great day!
58892	agent_2:What is a utopia exatly. agent_1:Like an ideal world where people can dedicate themselves to their passions since the basic needs such as energy is met  agent_2:That sounds wonderful.	agent_1:In any case, thanks for chatting.
18454	agent_2:Yea I enjoy Batman a lot although I haven't read much of the DC comics he's in agent_1:did you know there is a batman villain called condiment king? agent_2:No I never knew that, I wonder if he was a reason why Michael Keaton declined 15,000,000 to be in Batman Forever	agent_1:Well it could have been. do you know how condiment king was defeated?
41291	agent_2:Haha no, reminds me of this movie I watched when I was little where a boy follows a red balloon agent_1:There's a whole movie about that? agent_2:I believe it was like half an hour long. Kind of a short film. Kids catch up to it at the end. In the lemon video also people run to catch the fruit.	agent_1:I wonder if the guy preserved the lemon somehow. It'll probably be worth good money one day when people want to buy internet relics
33630	agent_1:Agreed! I do that a lot more. Although I am power walking more now, at a huge incline. agent_2:Yes, i would do that but i found it hard on my knees. the bike is a lot easier on my joints. agent_1:I understand. When my joints ache, I usually head over to the bike or pool.	agent_2:That is a good idea. loosen up the joints. anyway, i gotta run. great chat!
61282	agent_2:Did you know she served in the Israeli Defense Forces? agent_1:I did know that,  she revealed it in an interview I watched.    agent_2:I wonder if Mcdonalds in Israel gives her free Happy Meals. I hear they treated WWII soldiers well.	agent_1:Why would they give her free happy meals?  She didnt really serve in the wwi. I hear mc donalds invented the drive thru for soliders.
42735	agent_1:Good for him, he is amazing. DO you like radio dramas? agent_2:I do, apparently they have a lot of them.  agent_1:Yeah and they are all free so there you go	agent_2:Did you know that there is a show called Ikea heights?
108411	agent_1:Hello - how are you doing today? agent_2:Great. Hope you're well! So are you a fan of dancing? Bruce Lee happened to be an outstanding dancer and even won the Cha-Cha championship in Hong Kong back in 1958. agent_1:I like dancing, but I'm horrible at it. 	agent_2:Ha! Well you can be as bad as babies, right? Ha! They even spontaneously dance when they hear music and even smile when the beat is hit!
6457	agent_1:I'm sure it does. Which arcs did you enjoy the most of got agent_2:I liked the second story arc, that one was amazing what about you? agent_1:I like the 3rd arc since it makes everything else pale and insignificant in comparison. Oh but I liked it when jeffry died	agent_2:Yeah Jeffry had it coming, it was a fair death, he was a cruel boy and the actor was pretty good
141826	agent_2:That is great. The D.C teams are ran pretty well and organized. agent_1:I like the Nationals this year but they did do so well. agent_2:I really like learning about the sports and different teams.	agent_1:Every game tells a story which you want to see how it ends.
58888	agent_2:I mean that we need an effecient way to harness that power. Solar is probably the answer. It is just not even close to what we need yet. agent_1:True, but the efficiently of solar energy is slowly but surely increasing agent_2:That is true. Whoever figures it out though and makes it something everyone uses, is gonna be rich.	agent_1:Indeed or maybe we could finanly have a utopia?
24404	agent_2:Ha! Bigfoot too? So, there are a few biologically immortal animals out there. Do you know about them? agent_1:What are the biologically immortal animals.Turtles and elephants maybe? agent_2:Close...jellyfish and lobster	agent_1:Why are these animals considered biologically immortal?
147599	agent_2:yea I really like him in that tv show, House agent_1:It was a pretty good show. Are you a fan of Jim Carrey? 	agent_2:i like both his comedy films and his drama films, its upsetting that he wont make any more dramas though since his belief system prevents him from acting in a movie that doesnt project positivity
47001	agent_2:I have no clue.  I'm told it's really popular though.  It makes more money than football, baseball, basketball, hockey and golf COMBINED.  That's a LOT of dough! agent_1:Yeah. Most soccer is played with two teams, but there is a version played with three that I would love to see! agent_2:Yeah, I dunno how that would work.  I tell ya, you gotta be in GOOD shape to play soccer, they say a player runs an average of 7 miles per game!  I get tired just thinking about it.  HAHA!	agent_1:Really!  I am winded from adjusting my seat cushion... I hear Jon Stewart was an accomplished player.
52349	agent_1:ya it is, do you know that there is cell service on mouth everest? it makes it seem like it is not that remote if that is the case agent_2:I did, Clicking things on the internet can trigger an addiction. agent_1:that doesn't surprise me, what does surprise me is only about seven percent of people read the full terms of service on the internet, I'm shocked it's that high	agent_2:I agree that is high, but I am not surprised I do not read them!
26261	agent_1:Yes, and as they get more entrenched the divide grows deeper. There have been good men elected on both sides but no one will admit that someone else has a few good ideas. agent_2:Yes.  I never knew that every US president with a beard has been a republican.  Did you know that? agent_1:I did not, probably against their belief system to shave. I also didn't know that the Red/Blue labeling system only began to be used in the year 2000. I would have sworn that it had always been there.	agent_2:I'm with you on that.  I seem to remember that being around long before then.
163814	agent_1:yeah me too i stop seeing NFL on TV  not trying to get tickets  agent_2:I guess the most logical place for a women to start would be as a kicker. Since the average game has only 11 minutes of live play, the kicker must only play for about 2 minutes a game! agent_1:do you have favorite NFL  team where we can add a kicker 	agent_2:I like the Cowboys and the Falcons. I was surprised to see that engineers make more than football players over their life time. I guess because most only play for a few years before they get hurt.
57688	agent_2:I am a fan of dramas yeah, I like the opera and ballet as well. agent_1:Interesting, have you ever heard of Michael Caine?  agent_2:Not sure I have, is he a famous drama actor?	agent_1:He plays Alfred in the new Batmans.
92299	agent_1:What kind of a novel is it? Historical? Fantasy? agent_2:Historical fantasy.  In the story, his parents worked espionage. agent_1:Sounds exciting! I should look into it. By the way, do you like dogs?	agent_2:Yes, as long as they belong to other people.  Dogs can do so much to help people out.
121751	agent_2:yeah Anne Jones, she can read 4,700 a minute, I wonder how long it would take her to read the bible agent_1:Pretty fast I bet. do you know who tolkien and cs lewis are? agent_2:I think he wrote Game of thrones or The Lord of The rings, not sure all I know is they like laughing at bad poetry	agent_1:ahaha yeah they had those contests which one will laugh first
107026	agent_2:I like all of Led Zeppelin's albums. I also like Metallica. Their album and justice for all is my favorite. do you ever listen to Radiohead? agent_1:I do to some of the songs. Do you know who has the best selling album of 21st century agent_2:No I don't. Who is it? I do know that even Bob Marley still sells a lot of albums apparently	agent_1:It is Hybrid Theory by Linkin Park
115076	agent_1:I had to rent one once when my car got broken into, and thankfully my insurance paid the rental fee. I agree that $150 is really high for a cancellation fee - renting seems so expensive altogether! agent_2:Yep I agree with you. It's definitely a better deal just to lease or buy. Did you hear how Enterprise charge someone $800 for damage to the car? Even though she didn't do the damage agent_1:Rental agreements are harsh with their terms. They charge for rental insurance too, which pushes up the cost even more, but at least it prevents them from charging for damages like that!	agent_2:Speaking of cars, do you own a car? I can't believe there are 1.25 billion vehicles in the world
25691	agent_2:With the sheer amount of energy the sun produces, all that energy must come from somewhere. The sun is 1.39 million km in diameter, which is 109 times that of earth. It also is 330,000 times more massive than the earth, and, in fact, makes up 99.86% of the mass in the solar system. agent_1:True, yet a lightening bolt is still hotter than the surface of the sun. How on earth do people survive? agent_2:Well, the earth does have a lot of surface area, and since lightning needs a ground to attract its strike, most people are smart enough to get out of the way, and into cover. Regarding the moon, I just learned that its highest point is 1,938 meters higher than Mt. Everest on earth. For comparison, it's hard to imagine, Mt. Everest an addition 25% higher.	agent_1:Given less gravity, I wonder if it would be harder or easier to climb given all the gear and limitations on the moon
5878	agent_2:Yes, I did. they are stronger because they are hollow. lighter too. Did you know that birds have regional accents according to scientists? agent_1:No, I didn't know that. I also didn't know the feathers weight more than their bones.  agent_2:I guess that is also true of crows, which are among the most intelligent of birds, and are even capable of imitating human speech.	agent_1:Interesting. What do you know about machine learning?
40796	agent_2:Amazon sure has their hands in all the cookie jars owning a publishing arm, film and tv studio, consumer electronic lines, AWS subsidiary, among other businesses. agent_1:Ya it is kind of scary with how much they own, also they do employ a lot of people but I don't know that the benefits are good, did you see all the news recently about how they had no breaks and had to urinate in bottles? agent_2:I did not and I didn't know that working conditions were that extreme. I thought that Amazon touts work hard at pretty good pay and benefits, but I didn't know it was that bad.	agent_1:Yes you can google it, it was really messed up, but I also see that the average warehouse worker walks between 7 and 15 miles per day, I guess that is good for exercise at least
23104	agent_2:I wonder what they have in there, must be a store with everything possible agent_1:Exactly. Apple even had a clothing line agent_2:Yeah that was back in 1986, I wonder what happened to it though	agent_1:Yeah me too. Do you know much about Oscar Wilde?
41759	agent_2:I do like to watch, my favorite team actually has the best record in the league right now, how about you? agent_1:So you're a Bucks fan? How about Giannis Antetokounmpo! He's such a great player! agent_2:Good call!  I have always been, watched all 82 games when we won only 15 of them a few years back!  Yeah Giannis has been a gamechanger for our whole organization. Do you have a favorite team?	agent_1:I'm a Memphis Grizzlies fan, but enjoy watching a good game no matter who's playing.  I really like watching Stephen Curry and Lebron James. Did you know that they both were born in Akron, Ohio?
110393	agent_2:My wife has an X1 I bought for her last year agent_1:I have M6 blue color, I bought it this year and it is really amazing though gas is too expensive for it lol  Did you know that Mcdonalds' added drive-thru in 1975 to accommodate soldiers who were not allowed to get out of their cars while wearing their fatigues? agent_2:I had heard that before (drive thru). Wife's BMW has all the bells and whistles like GPS and in car entertainment	agent_1:yes. did you know that The nintendo entertainment system was finally discontinued in september of 2003 in japan?
161885	agent_2:I suspect that they (government) want it that way - to keep us confused and not sure who to trust or whats true - that just my conspiracy theory. agent_1:I think your right. Better to keep people confused, so you don't know whats really going on. agent_2:I'm pretty jaded when it comes to government, politics, the president, congress, etc.  Today it seems that reality is stranger than fiction....	agent_1:Very Strange, Some of the stuff that is reported is unreal!  Like the name President Banana for the first  name in Zimbabwe!
99596	agent_1:I'm doing well too! I do like them but hate them at the same time haha how about you? agent_2:right, like don't go in that room! lol. I like them a decent amount. agent_1:Can you believe the horror man himself Stephen King thought Bambi was a horror movie haha.	agent_2:right, talk about weak! lol! have you seen the movie the shining?
26842	agent_2:Human can be pretty cool. They can regrow a rib equally as strong as the original within 2 to 3 months. agent_1:wow, i never knew that. I just think about there is a sound frequency that causes fears in human agent_2:I must know it without knowing it. And to think it has only been 250,000 years since humans looked a lot different with a lot more body hair.	agent_1:I have a lot of body hair so I am glad times have changed and I don't have anymore lol!
42857	agent_1:Yeah, I agree. Intentions are hard to tell, though, especially when the news tells you the intention, without having any idea. lol agent_2:It is all about feelings now. I remember a time when acting with feelings was a thing for the stage not the news desk.  agent_1:The village people would be a hate crime and people would burn MP3 players. lol.  Thin skin is certainly a problem. 	agent_2:It can be. People just need to be respectful of each other. I don't understand why that is such a difficult concept for some to grasp.
125515	agent_2:I think the right teams were there. But I didn't like Maroon 5's performance.  I think they should have gotten a celebrity that would  garner more fame and attention from the crowd. agent_1:I agree with that. I didn't even watch the halftime show.  Speaking of the saints, did you know that their cheerleaders have to leave a restaurant if a player comes in? agent_2:I think that is a good strategy for keeping everyone focused on the game. They can play video games in their spare time instead! The 3d images of today are impressive and quite an art form!	agent_1:Yes they are.  I've been thinking about South Korea's law lately.  It's illegal there for kids under 16 to play video games past midnight.  That seems like a good idea.
130821	"agent_1:Oh yeah? I'd love to hear Jupiter! On YT I've found videos on the ""sounds of our planets"" it's very interesting to me! agent_2:That does sound very interesting!  Radio used to be such a huge part of our lives prior to YouTube.  Soldiers used to make radios in WW2 with razorblades and pencils! agent_1:Oh yeah! I've heard of that. I believe they are called foxhole radios. That's interesting for sure! I doubt I could make one."	agent_2:Yes, no chance I could make one!  Are you a football fan at all?  I am getting sick of the Patriots!  6 Super Bowls appearances with Belichick and Brady.  I am ready for new blood!
21235	agent_2:I've never heard of a dog blood drive! agent_1:thats a very valid point. surely there must be a need you would think agent_2:they probably bring it to certain vets 	agent_1:or organ donors for canines
101421	agent_1:that could be true. a cyborg with a whole company to upgrade his AI regularly. yet he is still r-g colorblind. a weakness to make him seem more human? agent_2:Perhaps. Are we on Zuck 2.0 yet?   agent_1:no one knows. it is a secret. he has all of facebook stored in his head. he would recognize you on the street, or from the satellite feed he has.	agent_2:Terminate!
154916	agent_2:It's a bizarre fact, for sure! Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the nineteenth century. agent_1:The junÃ­pero serra high school jv football team recorded a historically bad season in which they failed to win a game or even score a touchdown yet they never attempted to start their backup quarterback. that backup quarterback they refused to start is 4 time super bowl champion tom brady. agent_2:Wow!! Kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl	agent_1:Yeah thats weird.  Its been good talking to you!
83979	agent_2:Wow! That is! I love Target so I am not surprised lol. They are the 8th largest retailer in the US! agent_1:Thats good for them! agent_2:Right! There is a state senator that has to work at Target to makes ends meet! How weird is that haha	agent_1:Wow,  I wonder what state,  and why he has to do that if he is a state senator?  lol But I guess if you need a second job,  that one probably has a lot of good perks!
28880	"agent_1:That's sad for who lost them. A d.c. judge sued a small dry cleaning business for over $67 million for the loss of a pair of pants. agent_2:They must have been great pants.  I love that Collinsville, IL has a law that prohibits ""saggy pants."". The whole US needs that, in my opinion. agent_1:Some people dress silly. In the United Kingdom, the word pants generally means underwear and not trousers."	agent_2:Lol, that is funny. I heard awhile back that Aladdin's pants were modeled after MC Hammer.
103311	"agent_2:You can even take your doggy to donate blood if he is a generous doggy. agent_1:That's pretty cool! Google calls themselves a ""dog company"" in their code of conduct. I wonder what that entails? agent_2:I'm not sure but lucky for some stray dogs in Istanbul that people who recycle bottles will get food and water dispensed to dogs at vending machines "	agent_1:That's very cool! I learned a lot. Thanks for chatting!
123820	agent_1:Well, he did Toys Story 1 all the way up to Toy Story 4. Toy Story 4 was my favorite. It made me cry. I heard there was a Toy Story 5 coming up. agent_2:That is true he was the star of all of those movies.  I saw the first two Toy Story movies and they were really good.  agent_1:To be honest, the movies were pretty good from the start to current time. Watch the last two. They will be worth it.	agent_2:Yeah I think it is worth it to check them out when I can.  Did you ever watch the Lion King when it came out years ago?
104552	agent_1:No I think they determined it didn't happen, but I'm not a hundred percent sure on that it's crazy that there is a candy drawer in the Senate with unlimited candy LOL I want some of the Milky Way is right now agent_2:Been there since '68. Maybe the jellybeans are an homage to Ronald Reagan, who kept a jar on his desk. Have you ever witnessed a Senate session? agent_1:No I haven't. I only know that there are two senators per state so there are a total of 100 senators in the chamber	agent_2:Right. Powerful chamber of Congress since 1789. Did you know Nixon cracked the gavel that had been used for 165 years. Heard about that?
54730	agent_2:I think you have quite a few nearer to your coast.  Your state gets a lot more rain, so the 312,000 gallons needed per day are more available. agent_1:Yes, that is true agent_2:Did you know that Benz invented the first car as early as 1886?	agent_1:yes, and cars became widely avaliable in the early 20th centry and the first car was a 1908 Model T
19395	agent_1:yes but at least he still does comedies. Comedy and tragedy are parts of the same coin which is drama agent_2:That is very true, I guess he wants to stay positive and that is why he stopped making dramas. Did you know that Hugh Laurie is the highest paid actor. agent_1:Considering his performance, I'm not surprised	agent_2:Yeah, he makes $700,00 per episode! That is crazy!
59883	agent_1:What doe she do?  I wonder if she makes more the Belichick?  He's the winningest coach in the NFL for the postseason.  agent_2:She's a super model, whatever that means. Belichick is a great coach, they make such a great duo. Can't wait to seem them play next weekend. agent_1:She sounds super expensive... Yep, they seem to work together.  I think they'll win.  The Rams, unlike to Eagles, won't rattle the Pat's. 	agent_2:Seriously! I hope so, I mean he has won five Super Bowls! That's a great stat!
19634	agent_1:Hello, How are you? Do you like google? agent_2:Hello, I am good. How are you? I do like google.  I use it so much every day that it is hard to believe it's been around since 1998. It seems like it's always been around. agent_1:I know, I use it alot too! its always there to go to!	agent_2:Yes it is.  Larry Page and Sergey Brin have to be geniuses for thinking it up.
100991	agent_2:The Manning family is clearly talented. I appreciate that women are technically allowed to play. agent_1:How do you like  the single elimination tournament instead of a best of 7 games that we see in other sports ?  agent_2:I like it! I think it instills fierce competition.	agent_1:Yeah, it is really intense, do you wish there were more games in the regular season ?
51081	agent_2:It would have been a totally different movie.  I cant imagine it without Ryan Reynolds. agent_1:I like ryan reynolds, but I fell jack black would have been another great choice agent_2:Jack Black surely does comedy well	agent_1:I wonder if he does any voice acting
41177	agent_1:Yeah. Do you know who cadillac is named after? agent_2:Yes that was the founder of Detroit Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac agent_1:Yeah. Do you know how Jenn Mardenborough became a professional driver	agent_2:Yeah he beat 90 000 people in grand turismo, ,so awesome
18378	agent_1:No, but he sounds delicious. What is his trademark power?  agent_2:I guess he shot out ketchup. But that was also how he was defeated-he slipped on his own ketchup.	agent_1:Generally, I am in favor of entertainment, mostly because of its fun factor. When Caesar visited Britain, around 50 BC, he noted that people bred chickens not for food, but for entertainment. Were the people vegans? And did chickens have more colors than the NES?
143205	agent_2:Yes, every one of those is surprising except North Korea. From 9pm to 12am Netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in North America. agent_1:That's pretty crazy, and combined with youtube they make up half of peak internet traffic in North America agent_2:Impressive indeed. With that being said, Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth! 	agent_1:I'm surprised Netflix still sends out dvds if it costs that much but I guess its still profitable
33140	agent_1:Yes that is true. Earth will be helium free by the end of this century apparently agent_2:I wonder if that will change the fact that the earth rotates on its axis 366.26 time a year? No telling what affect that will have on us. agent_1:Yeah. Did you know the day was much shorter when the earth was formed?	agent_2:I did not! but that is not surprising seeing as the earth was formed over 4.5 billion years ago.
140084	agent_1:Hello, did you know Cadillac was named after a French explorer?  agent_2:I did not know that. Kind of cool and interesting agent_1:Yes, very cool and interesting. 	agent_2:I find it interesting that Mcdonalds created a drive through for soldiers. I would have never guessed that
133985	"agent_1:Or, we could make them release albums while they are in office, to lighten the mood. The Indonesian president released three. agent_2:3 of them really? thats impressive he must be talented, well  he can always teach Trump and Hillary a thing or two about the genre.  agent_1:At this point, I think anyone could teach them both, about anything. I wish my state had the ""none of these candidates"" option, like Nevada."	agent_2:Yeah that sounds like a great option, sometimes the best option is none of them. Voter turnout has been really low over the years.
151194	agent_1:In high school during your days, were girls allowed to play football? That is sad. They should allow the cheerleaders to eat with the players. agent_2:yes, we actually had a girl on our football team,  she didnt play much though.  agent_1:I guess they are getting used to a girl being in the team.	agent_2:Did you know the nfl uses tracking chips embedded in the players football pads.
137621	agent_1:It is interesting how games can produces 2D and 3D images to create worlds within a flat screen agent_2:Yes. Technology has greatly improved video games making them more and more addictive. Did you know in South Korea it's illegal for kids 16 and under to play after midnight? Not sure how they enforce that. I never would have made it as a kid there. agent_1:I understand where they are coming from, but a strict cuttoff based on midnight probably is inconvenient for people with various schedules	agent_2:Well there is no reason for kids to be up past midnight really. Plus they have big problems with internet addiction so the same is likely true for gaming. I recently hooked up my old atari. It wouldn't work on today's tvs so I busted out an old black and white from my garage.
55636	agent_1:I heard that traveling in Japan is quite expensive especially if you go on the highways, the tolls costs more than $300 to travel across the country, I wonder how much the US costs? agent_2:If some one searched for tool roads in the US, they could probably find a few hundred bucks.  Some toll roads are loops though.  Mackinac Island has no motorized vehicles. It is a Michigan tourist trap. agent_1:Yeah and with how big the US is, I imagine driving on the toll roads could become a lot more expensive than Japan. So how do the people who live on Mackinac Island travel?	agent_2:Most people use a bike.  The tourists use horse drawn carriages.  The island is deserted in the winter.  I wonder if Native Icelanders would use a public rail system if available?
9176	agent_2:Facebook is even in on the development of AI, trying to understand human emotion, and predict user actions.  It is almost there with the fact when you search for something you start to see ads for it on Facebook.  Re-targeting as become amazing that way agent_1:Yes, we're at the point where tasks like OCR are often excluded from AI because they've become such a routine technology. agent_2:I personally am excited to see further development in the self driving car type of technology.	agent_1:I love driving, so I'm not personally excited to use that, but I think it's better than dealing with all of the distracted drivers on the road because they're looking at their phones. Google actually calculates traffic using the movement of Android devices on the road!
138108	agent_2:They haven't been great.  Certainly not what Ohio State has been, but what do you make of all the stuff that happened with Urban Meyer going into the 2018 season? agent_1:I didn't know Drake's middle name is actually Drake.  agent_2:Funny that there was a Drake involved with the Ohio State University and handled the Urban Meyer affair.	agent_1:Interesting, what is the Urban Meyer affair?
47897	agent_1:I have no idea, is it someone famous? agent_2:Yes its Harry Lloyd. Charlie chaplins granddaughter is on the show as well.  agent_1:Wow that's crazy, maybe showmanship runs in the family. They have a lot of influence too. The fasted growing girls baby name in the US is Anya, based off a character.	agent_2:Yeah i heard that. apparently the show is financed by Ireland.
109103	agent_1:did you know women can also play if they make the cut? agent_2:I do! I would like to see the chips from their shoulder pads that records their movement. I bet results would be different in women. agent_1:I am sure they are different even from player to player. do you know how long a game lasts in terms of playtime?	agent_2:Not very long. About 11 minutes. Crazy to get paid as much as they do for such little play. However, engineers make more money.
115205	agent_1:OMG, lol, I can get a visual of that!! funny, Must have scary drivers their? Tupac's music is in the Library of Congress! agent_2:I guess they say that it has cultural significance, did you ever listen to Eminem? Do you know who his favorite comic book hero was? agent_1:Yes,  Seems like I have heard that before, its different? Who? 	agent_2:Yes it was Spider-Man Actually. And when he was in high school he actually wanted to be a comic book artist originally instead of a rapper
160813	agent_1:How's it going, do you know 1886 is considered the birth year of the car? agent_2:Oh wow, I didn't know that. I was recently reading a story about a horrific car accident car, Yikes agent_1:That sounds terrible, that lady Elizabeth McKeown sound like  she's mentally ill	agent_2:Yes, exactly! She claims that she was in a hurry to make her car payment when she did this unthinkable act. She is being charged with first degree murder. It seems she has not regret either.
21003	agent_2:I did not see that. I do like that idea though. I think animals need to be protected more. agent_1:Germany is apparently the first country on the planet to do it.  They did it back in 2002. agent_2:Interesting. I saw animals get white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated.	agent_1:Hmm, I wonder why.  Have you heard about Scotland protecting the loch ness monster?
77831	agent_2:So do you like reading? i try to read a lot. agent_1:Yes,  I also enjoy reading.  agent_2:what kind of stuff do you read? fiction? non fiction?	agent_1:I like fiction,  sci fi,  mystery.  How about yourself?
1221	agent_1:I also like to watch movies on Netflix. Its convenient and the premium is not too high agent_2:Exactly, Spykids received a 93% fresh rating on rotten tomatoes, better than, say, lincoln or the dark knight rises. agent_1:true that. How about soundtracks. Any thoughts on that?	agent_2:I didn't realize that Steven spielberg played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack.
80104	agent_1:Hmm I wonder if that includes how you lace them too. I don't wear many shoes with laces. It is more cowboy boots and much boots here which can be quite spendy because of functionality.  agent_2:Some boots are even designed for specific purposes like mountaineering or skiing agent_1:Ski boots that are fitted properly can run you hundreds of dollars. Seems a bit silly to spend that much on a boot you can only do one thing in. 	agent_2:How do you feel about designer shoes? They can sell for hundreds if not thousands
86499	agent_1:Well the field of basketball is constantly changing. Kareem Jabbar's dunking was banned for over a decade, but now dunking is a art agent_2:Especially Steph Curry's dunks! On point! agent_1:I agree. In addition to the fame and skill, basketball players also rake in the money.	agent_2:What do you mean by rake?
121132	agent_1:Yeah me too. It was not as cool as voting from space though as astronauts do agent_2:Oh, definitely not. It's definitely a privilege to vote. Did you know that 34% of the black male population in Alabama has lost the right to vote? CRAZY. agent_1:I know that is just so sad. In India on the other hand they set up a voting poll for a guy who lived among lions	agent_2:So interesting. Speaking of voting, my favorite election is when we elect the president. Would you agree?
114677	agent_1:I do as well. It seems like it runs our lives, especially that hamburger button lol. agent_2:lol, I try to make myself get off and do other productive things. Sitting too long is not good. Of course you can walk around and still be on your phone.lol agent_1:I avoid my phone when I can too haha. Sometimes I like to put the television on haha.	agent_2:lol, I know, that use to be what was on all the time. Its rare now. I have cable and never watch it.
51334	agent_1:I have not seen it yet, but I really want to check it out. agent_2:The quality of animated films is usually quite high, I find. agent_1:I think so too. Incredibles 2 was set in the 1960s.	agent_2:I think there might be a problem with the chat servers, by the way. I had fun chatting! Have a good day.
34680	agent_2:Over a $40 late fee on Apollo 13 that must of really pissed off Reed Hastings agent_1:right, talk about a great payoff! I wonder how blockbuster is doing now lol agent_2:I think Blockbuster only has 1 store left and kicking itself for not buying netflix for 50 million	agent_1:I heard about the 1 store, I think it is doing awesome lol. They could have had the 2 billion net worth of netflix, they let it slip through their hands
85634	agent_1:Yeah and he still published in journals, pretty cool agent_2:I know. Do you know who invented the world wide web? agent_1:yea an english guy in 1989 who was working at the CERN	agent_2:Yeah we are so glad that guy did that
159242	agent_2:haha I probably have that addiction, I'm just glad the internet is being backed up somewhere every day, I would be so sad if it went down and we lost all our internet knowledge agent_1:The world would be in an uproar. There keeping the copy at the Alexandria Library, right? agent_2:yup thats right, by the way, have you ever read the terms of service on a website? I never have, apparently only 7% of people do, are you one of the 7% haha	agent_1:Nah i'm in the higher class of 93%, haha. It's to much jargon. Did yoiu know that storms on Jupiter are so powerful they can be picked up on AM radio?
71317	agent_1:Hi, do you like to read? agent_2:Yes, but I don't do as much as I used to.  I read Ender's Game as it is required reading in the USMC. agent_1:I read that too.  It is an excellent book.  How did you feel the movie followed the book	agent_2:Fairly well... I always picture things differently with a book.  Did you know there was a moral panic in the 18th century because people were reading novels?  If they could see us now...
68073	"agent_2:Hi! I have no idea what that is, if I had to take a guess, does it relate to something musical? agent_1:I just looked it up.  It is a theater company in Washington DC.  I think they started with The Headless Horseman.  But recently they did a play called ""Titus Andronicus"" agent_2:Oh wow, that's interesting, I have never seen a theater show, have you? If I were to see one, I hope to see something by Shakespeare because he wasn't just a great poet, he was also a writer, a playwright, and actor! His unique talent must've known how to capture the attention of the audience."	agent_1:This is a Shakesperean play.  A critic got to attend on a preview night which is unusual.  He saw things that he would not see on a normal opening night.  I have been to a couple of Broadway shows and a Passion Play in an amphitheater.  It is sobering to see a live sized person crucified in front of you!
121472	"agent_2:I believe its referred to as the Grand Old Party (GOP), correct?  How do you feel about the media's coverage of news and politics?  Are there any outlets you consume more than others? agent_1:No not really I try to listen to a little bit of everything as the media is very biased sometimes agent_2:Me too... I don't even like reading/watching news outlets that are generally on the same ""side"" of opinion as me, because I don't enjoy how biased everything is.  I've found that the Wall Street Journal is a pretty good news source that generally just reports the news and removes any personal opinion or bias."	agent_1:Yeah. I wonder how the system of ancient greece appointing people by lottery would work nowadays
160511	agent_2:Those are so cute and definitely not a police dog haha. Yes, dogs can even assist in the police and military and they are a person's best friend! Army cadets have actually tried stealing a flacon and ended up injuring it after putting it in a dog crate agent_1:That's so intriguing. Dogs have a special place in our lives. They do so much for us. And who knew dogs actually understand when we point to something?  agent_2:They are smart animals! I don't recall which team has a dog as their mascot, but the Naval Academy has a goat called Bill as their mascot! I wonder if they bring out the same goat each time	agent_1:That's so silly! The army doesn't allow pranks on live animals. It's good they protect the animals.
32653	agent_2:And also there were no policies regarding the type of music played. So maybe they need to institute a policy and then if people violate it, they can be fired. agent_1:Well if it is the automatic playlist on spotify they can't know someone will complain till they do. agent_2:Yeah and now Duke faces criticism for freedom of expression	agent_1:Well it isn't Duke's fault. This just feels like something that got blown way over proportion. The official is free to comment that it was bothering him and it should have ended with the employee simply playing another song.
43972	agent_1:Hello do you like baketball? agent_2:Yes I really enjoy basketball, I like playing it and watching it. My favorite player is Allen Iverson, he even managed to secure a lucrative endorsement deal with Reebok worth more than $50 million! agent_1:yeah thats a sweet deal!  I hear that shooting granny style is the most effective technique lol 	agent_2:Have you seen any professional players deploy that technique on the court?
72466	agent_2:Cut the cord, friend! LOL agent_1:Amen! When south park aired its family guy episode finale the producers received flowers from the simpsons crew agent_2:I was actually thinking about Mat and Trey this morning.  Did you know there is an episode of the Simpsons where Bart does not appear and is not mentioned?	agent_1:I did not know that! Ringo starr, george carlin, and alec baldwin have all narrated thomas the tank engine for at least 52 episodes each
112094	agent_2:That is a lot of animals!!!  1 million of those are insects - I am not a fan agent_1:hahaha that is funny, did you know in Germany they have legal rights! agent_2:That is pretty cool.  I know there is a lawyer in Switzerland who represents animals in court!	agent_1:I never heard about that. In germany this started back in 2002, I think that is necessary
97147	agent_2:Yeah, i would have gone ballistic if i received a $40 late fee for a vhs tape!! Really??!! agent_1:I think Reed hastings did go ballistic....he took off on a rocket called Netlix with 137 subscribers! agent_2:Yeah now he's a billionnair!!	agent_1:And Blockbuster declined buying them for only 50 million!
70697	agent_1:I wish more people knew about the sun's power.  Then again, you said a lightening bolt is hotter than the sun.  Maybe there is a way to use that instead. agent_2:I think if solar power came down in price, more people could gain from it. agent_1:I completely agree with you.  Our sun is so powerful and yet it's only a billionth the size of the biggest star in our galaxy that we know of.	agent_2:Yeah. There's a lot of lost opportunity with solar. Neptune just finished its first orbit around the sun!
108984	"agent_1:Not only that, but they've also got one in the ball, keeping track of it's position, speed, and all that.  Bet that's handy for determining how far it gets thrown and stuff. agent_2:Yeah and how fast it is going.   That is all useful in helping to practice and setting pitching machines to not wear out the QB's arm agent_1:It's a pity they don't have a function to tell how much the ball is inflated, otherwise they could have avoided that ""deflate gate"" scandal that happened a few years back... (dunno fi you remember that or not.)"	agent_2:I do.  Tom Brady and the Patriots were under fire for that.
13425	agent_1:Hey how is it going, do you have a facebook account? agent_2:I do, although I use instagram more. What about you? agent_1:I do have an instagram account, no facebook. I can't believe MYspace turned down an offer to buy facebook in 2005.	agent_2:Agreed, it was only for 75 million!  Now, they are worth over a billion.
148701	agent_1:ya that would be interesitng, I could see a female punter or something, I think we could see that in our lifetime agent_2:yeah for sure. did you know the average game play is only 11 minutes? agent_1:no I didn't that seems low, also low is their salary, over their lifetime an engineer will make more than a football player	agent_2:yeah . I kind of like that because engineers contribute so much more to the world
114887	agent_1:Yes that is in Ireland and France agent_2:Yeah. Did you know Roosevelt did not allow Christmas trees in the WHite House? agent_1:Yes he was a huge conservationist and did not allow them in	agent_2:Yeah Did you know they still use floppy discs to save stuff?
3879	agent_2:The day has been getting longer. It was only 5.5 hours. Soon it'll be so long that we'll have a 20-hour workday. I bet people will want more vacation.  agent_1:that is wacky, will the day continue to get longer? like a 40 hour day at somepoint? agent_2:Maybe in billions of years. Humanity will be long gone, having cut down all the forests and filled the oceans with plastic.	agent_1:ya that is sad to think about, also sad we'll have run out of helium by the year 2100
7046	agent_2:Wow that's really nice of him. I think it was something like three hundred thousand Euros? And it was paying for surgeries for those kids. That is so nice agent_1:that is super heartwarming. do you know jon stewart? agent_2:I do know him. I think he was on The Daily Show correct?	agent_1:Yeah he is and he was also a very skilled soccer player
54531	agent_2:My vet has a parrot named Mario who is too mean to live with anyone. He can sound like the phone and talk just like the receptionist. It was really funny agent_1:I bet! I've not been into superheroes for quite a while. Batman was probably my favorite. Were you ever into superheroes? I think that Stan Lee recently died. Wasn't he the Marvel comic creator? agent_2:I wasn't into superheroes a lot. I do like the movies they have made out of comic book superheroes. Stan lee did die. I'm going to miss seeing him in the movies. 	agent_1:Oh, my first superhero love was Superman, though. I loved Clark and Lois. The newer Superman movies were pretty good, too. I used to wonder about all the collateral damage many superheroes caused as they were saving the world. Lol
107126	agent_2:Im not sure, I think I heard of her but not completely familiar, why? agent_1:I know that the Chicago Symphony Orchestra has been playing a new low brass concerto she composed.  Do you have a chance to make it to many concerts? agent_2:I actually love concerst as well, I like live music and also like recitals, what about you?	agent_1:I haven't been able to in awhile though I wish I lived in Croatia and could attend a concert at an ancient Roman amphitheater.
47173	agent_2:It is the most popular sport on the international level. agent_1:Americans call it soccer because it was slang for association football. agent_2:Honestly, I used to always confuse football with american football	agent_1:Me too. There exists a variation of soccer where 3 teams face each other at the same time.
87070	agent_1:Fox owns a lot of stuff. I guess the news part is quite separate. I don't know how they woluldn't know that though. Funny. Still, Fox news is watched more than cnn and msnbc combinded agent_2:Yeah that doesn't surprise me, what does surprise me is that opinion news on Fox is only 55% while at MSNBC is 85%, 85% seems really high agent_1:Yes, I don't know how they calculate that. Maybe a talk show is opinion? I don't know.	agent_2:Yeah I think that's how they do it. Also, Fox News tried to make your own version of The Daily Show but apparently only lasted 13 episodes
34593	agent_2:Me either. But Gangnam style was so popular they had to upgrade the system agent_1:Is there anything else you use on the computer? agent_2:I use Facebook alot.  Did you know founder is red-green colorblind?	agent_1:Must be why facebook is blue. Even if he wasn't I like the calming affects of blue
83276	agent_1:Yes he did not want to be associated with the republicans  agent_2:Yeah, he just wanted to be as much removed from them as possible agent_1:Yeah. It was nice chatting with you	agent_2:Same here, and keep voting always
82490	agent_1:yeah I heard it was like a maze and they didn't know actually where the drain pipe goes to find the young boy. agent_2:Apparently the water is 2 ft. deep? So I guess he would be okay? I thought the physical impacts were the most dangerous parts, like the fall. agent_1:yeah that's what I was thinking. Did he every speak to any of his family?	agent_2:Yes, he called to speak to them. Looks like they reunited.
66051	agent_2:Well I don't think Mao and Stalin had theme parks like Kim does agent_1:I think you're right. Do you know Ringo Star? agent_2:Yea, he was the beatles drummer and even narrated Thomas the Tank Engine	agent_1:Yea along with George Carlin and Alec Baldwin. I love those guys especially Carlin he was hilarious as well.
159583	agent_2:I like ironic memes on social media and I usually use instagram, facebook, and twitter for this agent_1:A good part of memes are based on TV shows and movies, don'T you need to watch TV and movies to appreciate them ? agent_2:I do watch movies, mostly classics from the 70s and 80s and occasionally new movies whose genre I like. But a lot of memes I like aren't from TV shows or movies at all	agent_1:Indeed, they are based on viral videos, but some are based on TV shows like South Park on comedy central,  do you watch that channel ?
85013	agent_2:Sometimes. Did you ever use MySpace? agent_1:I sued to, they made a bad decision not buying Facebook for just $75 million agent_2:Exactly. Do you know the like button is illegal in parts of Germany?	agent_1:I wonder why though. DO you know why it is blue?
147258	agent_1:Thanks! Maybe you'll get a chance to see a live game! agent_2:I would enjoy that at some point. I've lived in 3 cities with national teams so maybe I 'll get to see one of them play. agent_1:I should try to go myself one day.	agent_2:Do you have a favorite team?
117342	agent_2:I liked it but it really flopped in the UK it seems agent_1:Yes they remade it verbatim and had to cancel after 10 episodes agent_2:Yeah. How about Pokemon?	agent_1:I have seen only a few of the total of 750 episodes
74418	agent_2:In turn, that is where knowing what skill sets each member has to be able to position each dancer to the advantage of the writer to portray the best overall. agent_1:Kent chose to use John Cranko's choreography, which meant she had to focus more on dancer skill than story telling. agent_2:That is exaclty my expressions all along as know the skill set of the dancers at hand best works to the advantage when a performance is at hand for the audience to really grasp the concept as well as the overall feel of what is mostly being portrayed at the time.	agent_1:Working with Kent seems to bring out skill that Lee innately possesses.  That's why Lee chose to joint the Washington Ballet one year and a half ago.
20728	"agent_1:That's so weird. Similarly you can't ""own"" a pet in boulder colorado you are their ""guardian"". agent_2:huh, so strange.  Hamsters are banned in Hawaii.  I wonder why? agent_1:I think maybe because they are small, get loose a lot and become invasive."	agent_2:I never thought about that.  Interesting!
68100	"agent_1:I'm not surprised with all those people watching it that Justin Bieber's ""baby"" got disliked. agent_2:I thought it was a good video actually lol, how much power  Youtube and Netflix have together! agent_1:Do you think the actors should get paid so much?  For instance Hugh Laurie made $700,000 an episode in House."	agent_2:I think thats an insane amount of money, totaly unfair when theres a lot of poverty in the world, I bet Hugh Laurie is one of the best paid actors in the show biz.
88416	agent_1:NBA player, I guess earned by promoting Reebok merchandise. Seems like easy money. agent_2:I hope he appreciates that and maybe donates some of it to charity...  agent_1:Would be nice.  Speaking of money to blow, Nike used to pay the fine every game so Jordan could wear the Air Jordan sneakers.	agent_2:Fine ? Why would there be a fine ?
138080	agent_2:Can you imagine trump singing something that makes you want to dance?  agent_1:oh my gawd....absolutely not lol I would never buy that album! agent_2:Right, Would you let someone call you President Banana, like the President of Zimbabwe? 	agent_1:Haha,  If it was my name I would definitely let them call me President Banana.  His name was Canaan Banana.
15574	agent_2:Ronald Mc Donald is creepy, but It never stopped me for going to Mc Donalds.  Did you know there is more libraries than Mc Donalds in the US. agent_1:That is wild!  I need to publish a book in Norway, you are guaranteed to sell at least 1,000! agent_2:Great incentive !! and they promise to take it to different libraries of the country.	"agent_1:That is great.  Speaking of books I am not sure I ever realized Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally from ""Parks and Recreation"" were actually in love until they released their recent book."
82621	agent_1:TV is the only thing left of the civilized world. We would be beasts without TV to civilize us. I have not seen the non-Bart episode. He must have been sick. Or gone on strike. agent_2:Ha! Maybe so! Speaking of The Simpson's, their crew actually sent the South Park producers flowers after they aired the Family Guy episode. I thought that was pretty nice of them! agent_1:I think that the SP guys made fun of the FG guys and the Simpsons guys appreciate the joke. 	agent_2:Yeah, you are right about that! Did you also watch the 70s Show? There was a UK remake but sadly it was cancelled after 10 episodes.
72498	agent_1:Do you like to travel? agent_2:I love to travel. I'm going on a multi-state trip in June to visit family. How about you? agent_1:that is awesome, I am going to Brazil in june, to visit my wife	agent_2:That's amazing! How are you getting there? Taking a plane, a bus, something else?
152051	agent_2:Hello there, I am a fan, I think that would be so cool if one did! agent_1:Yeah because there is no written rule against it! Maybe one day... agent_2:Yeah I hope so, I think it would be so cool for all the young girls out there. 	agent_1:Yeah very inspiring for them. It would be better than being a Saints cheerleader that's for sure! They can't even interact with any players.
25152	agent_2:Oh wow that's crazy! Did you know that since jellyfish are 98% water they would evaporate in the sun? agent_1:That makes sense but it's still a little surprising.I read there is a jelly fish that is immortal. I gotta know more about that... agent_2:lol I've read that too. There's a specific species of jellyfish that never dies. It basically keeps regrowing new cells it's entire life. 	agent_1:I could use that for the bags under my eyes! And my face in general!!!!
37711	agent_1:Me too, do you like the new ones or the old ones better? agent_2:Old ones!  I was 7 when the first one came out in 1977. agent_1:wow, i wasn't even a thought yet during that but I love them still! Lucas became a billionaire because of those!	agent_2:Too bad he didnt share that money with James Earl Jones.  He only received 7500 for recording the voice of darth vader.
124135	agent_1:I know, Id miss my family and friends too much.  I think they might destroy Mars though, i mean if you look at current reality tv like Big Brother and all those it could spell doom for it. agent_2:Mental images I don't need! Let's keep Mars pristine (for now). There may come a day where we actually need to live there instead of just for fun.  agent_1:I agree, Lichens and cyanobacteria can already survive there.  SO there is possibilities.	agent_2:I also imagine that lost satellite might be a problem.
109529	agent_1:It's pretty good. I feel like it's made for the kids that grew up watching him too. It's called Bill Nye Saves the World. agent_2:That sounds great.  A bit of nostalgia, I love when they redo shows from when I was a kid and do them justice. agent_1:Still educational!	agent_2:That is amazing.  It has been great chatting!  Have a great night!
56951	agent_1:Apparently Hugh Laurie was making $700k per episode on House.  agent_2:Dang what a boss! I'm glad Jim Carrey doesn't do dramas anymore, his niche is comedy for sure.  agent_1:Yeah, I wasn't a fan of Carrey's dramas either, although I never made all the way through one of them. 	agent_2:Lol I can relate. Michael Caine became an actor to get close to all the prettiest girls!
107284	agent_2:It really is. I think maybe they do it to try and build camraderie or something. agent_1:Sports in general seem to build camaraderie so that makes sense, but the republicans are leading by 3 wins. I'm sure that annoys the democrats. agent_2:I bet it does.  Did you know that in Nevada you can vote for none of the candidates during an election?	agent_1:I did not know that and that seems kinda pointless. I think it's interesting that since 1900 taller candidates win the presidential election 75% of the time.
160470	agent_2:Can you imagine both Democrat and Republican in the top 2 offices? OMG. Speaking of TV  Are you a fan? Did you know that there is only one simpsons that bart was not on and was not mentioned? agent_1:I have started streaming a lot more. TV has become a mass medium for too much advertisement agent_2:I stream so much because I have 2 jobs and am not home very much. It is so convenient. My sons did watch Thomas the Tank on PBS and Ringo Star, Alec Baldwin, and George Carlin were all Mr. Conductors. I remember watching them.	agent_1:Have you tried to stream all 750+ episodes of pokemon?
6165	agent_2:I'll take back a bit. I like Edgar Allen Poe. I know watching horror movies can burn up to 180 calories! agent_1:Interesting. So instead of going to the gym, you just sit there and watch the movies?  agent_2:Right! Did you know Bambi terrified Stephen King.	agent_1:I'm not surprised, Bambi does die in the end.
42000	agent_2:Surprised its higher than 1%! Do you read them? agent_1:Depends on what the service, sometimes I do though.  agent_2:are yo u a member of Reddit?	agent_1:I'm not, but I do read the posts fairly often, what about you?
127028	agent_1:me too. so much drama and craziness like a greek Drama. All the action in sports is basically a 4 part play agent_2:Right! I don't like many dramas, but would love to see Ikea Heights because I like Ikea! agent_1:Drama is my thing. trying to make that hugh laurie time of payday for a TV drama. 700, 000 is alot of money for a 24 episode series	agent_2:Completely.  Wouldn't you love to be a student in Patrick Stewart or Jon Hamm's class?
66066	agent_2:I bet he was pretty good. he is a good actor. he probably helped his students' careers too. agent_1:Funny you should say that because one of his students was Ellie Kemper who played Erin from The Office. agent_2:Oh, yeah. i know that show. she is great. she has had quite a career. i wonder if she would be a good teacher.	agent_1:Good question. Maybe so. I love The Office and there have been several guests on the show who bring their dog! I love animals. There are about 20 quintillion animals on earth!
46778	agent_1:Yes, although some did start in a small apartment as well. agent_2:thats true. humans are amazing. agent_1:Speaking of humans, we may have only lost our body hair 240,000 years ago!	agent_2:i wonder if it was because of climate change.
3226	agent_2:no I did not realize that why are they cancelling so many shows?  agent_1:Personally it feels like it because so many people are so sensitive now.  agent_2:I agree with that I think people are way too sensitive now.. I liked all the shows that used to be on like 3rd Rock form the Sun it won the golden globe for best comedy series in 1997	agent_1:I loved 3rd rock!  Are you into comics at all? I am not but my boys are.
105670	agent_2:Lets talk about Poetry next. There is a poem that if it is read normally is depressing, but backwards and it is inspiring.  agent_1:Sorry, I was trying to write a poem, but got hit enter too quick. Did you know that the Japanese Alphabet, when recited in order, forms a poem? agent_2:interesting, The names for most of the Hobbit's were taken from an Icelandic poem. 	"agent_1:I've heard that, it's the old peom called ""Dvergatal"" right?"
50882	agent_2:Hi! Yes! Love that movie! Did you know it was a video game before a movie?!  agent_1:I didn't know about the video game. That makes sense though because it was 13 years between movies. They had to keep the fans interested.  agent_2:It's facinating though and amazing, I never noticed how the events in the incredibles is based in the 1960's i thought that was interesting! 	agent_1:I always wondered about that because sometimes it seems like the 60's but then there is modern day stuff mixed in like the behaviors of the characters and cars.
57271	agent_1:That is awesome! agent_2:Been nice talking to you! agent_1:Thanks. Same!	agent_2:See ya!
80504	agent_1:It was a great game, with different characters with different abilities. They still made the console till 2003 , that is probably some kind of record.  agent_2:Yeah when you think about how basic that system was compared to what they have today. I think ps3 will last a long time though just because it will play blurays. that is about all I use mine for anymore. agent_1:Chicken also were used as a form of entertainment in roman times, and when you got bored with it you could eat it. 	agent_2:So true. Well its been fun. Have a good one.
159730	agent_2:I think they have been accused of that. lol  The percentage of airtime on Fox news dedicated to opinion is 55%...for MSNBC it's 85%! agent_1:Yeah would make sense, the gaming website IGN is also owned by Fox News agent_2:I didn't know that!  In 2015 the median viewer age for Fox news was 68 years old.	agent_1:Thats an old range of viewers, so what are your thoughts on our president?
20625	agent_1:I agree. Animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated. agent_2:Very interesting, so that is why, I never knew that.  agent_1:I had no idea either. Germany became the first country to give animals constitutional rights.	agent_2:It sounds like back in 2002, I wonder if other countries will eventually follow.
55978	agent_1:Thats true.  I just don't see him as a funny guy I guess.  agent_2:I have been reading about how the Chinese singer, named Wu, used Bots to outsell Adriana Grande and Lady Gaga.  Mankind is often dishonest. agent_1:Wow!  That's crazy,  but he also has talent if he can do that.	agent_2:They claim that it is auto-tuned, so I am not sure about talent.
161551	agent_2:I think the irony is there, though. Kind of like how the White House guest house is bigger than the actual White House. agent_1:Just like it would be ironic if the runner up in an election became the VP now like they used to. Nothing would get accomplished agent_2:Right? Could you imagine? That's probably why it only lasted until 1805.	agent_1:By then the parties would have started becoming more divided as the population grew. Still, many who become President are still wealthy people
117247	agent_1:I guess. Do you know how the VP used to be elected? agent_2:Yes that was the runner up that moved into that position agent_1:Yes that is a good way to go about that I think	agent_2:True. It was really nice chatting with you today
19120	agent_2:blue shirts and khaki pants, i wonder if they were all properly pressed before hand agent_1:One can only hope... I avoid 100% like I avoid bad alcohol like grappa and kombucha agent_2:lol, id avoid that weird living biohazrd too. 	agent_1:Yep... BTW: I meant 100% cotton... Hard to do with polo shirts that actually have a tennis history and not polo...
113097	agent_2:Did you think there was a great meaning behind that color? agent_1:It was the mother's favorite color. They ended up wearing matching outfits made by a relative. Another friend did Mom's hair and makeup. agent_2:This seems like a dream come true, indeed.	agent_1:And it happened near Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love!
14159	agent_1:That's good. The world record for speed reading is 4700 words per minute. That's fast! agent_2:per minute? how do you comprehend that fast i wonder? agent_1:I don't even know how that works to be honest.	agent_2:thats like, almost  80 words per second! i cant imagine being able to read that fast
77908	agent_2:Oh that sounds pretty awesome but hopefully no innocent people get hurt by accident. In India, they had to make a new car horn to withstand heavy use. agent_1:I guess that makes sense, there's so many people and so much chaos on those roads! I think part of the mess comes from motor vehicles mixing with pedestrians and bicycles. On Mackinac Island, MI, motorized vehicles are completed banned--isn't that quaint? agent_2:interesting. how do people get around?	agent_1:Bikes and even horse-drawn carriages! I guess they don't have steep hills like SF.
72379	agent_1:Well I was driving my car with my dog and we actually stopped at a drive-thru, I never knew that drive-thrus were started in 1975 agent_2:Right - McDonalds did it to help the soldiers.  That was nice of them. agent_1:Yes I agree. The soldiers could not get out of their car if they were wearing fatigues so McDonald's created the drive-up window, Burger King should let us put flamethrowers on our cars so we can get that flame grilled taste on the go lol	"agent_2:laugh!  I know - I wonder if google's cars which have an ""aggressive"" mode come with flamethrowers?"
84793	agent_1:I enjoy both; I really like watching basketball live and in person. agent_2:Did you know the supreme court building has a basketball court on the top floor?  agent_1:I had hear that, I love the name they gave to the 'high court'.	agent_2:LOL yes that's a good name. I saw the New Zealand basketball team name is called the Tall Blacks.
35975	agent_2:Wow amazing. Tim DUncan decided to get a degree and then get into the NBA agent_1:Good for him. Iverson signed a crazy contract with Rebook in 2001	agent_2:How good was it? Most players have trouble financially after they retire
153818	agent_2:Its smaller? that doesnt make sense at all, I wonder why they made the White House smaller then agent_1:I'm not sure. Do you like Pokemon? agent_2:I do like Pokemon, used to be my favorite show as a kid, its been 16 years since the show premiered	"agent_1:Yeah. Hilarious! I played pokemon go. Let's just say that ""I didn't go anywhere!"""
8263	agent_2:Lol thats pretty cool but not as cool as Talkeetna Mayor Stubbs agent_1:Mayor Cat?  Hmm...  hed probably put nap time as mandatory.  I could get behind that. agent_2:He has been a mayor since 1997 so he has spent at least 10 years of his tenure sleeping	agent_1:He probably has, that is crazy.  I wonder how that happened?
160597	agent_1:I favor the US college game and have been an Oklahoma fan since I was 8 years old.  The University of Iowa painted the visitor's locker room pink for a mental advantage. agent_2:Thats pretty smart tactic,  to soften them up.  Unless they like pink lol  agent_1:There have been actual studies that prove that weight lifters cannot lift as much in a room with pink walls.  Most of the world calls what we call soccer, football.	agent_2:Interesting,  had no idea.  In the sixties,  top bowlers made more than football players,  kinda weird huh
120095	agent_2:I know what you mean about that.  I like Michael Jordan.  Have you heard that Lebron has a photographic memory? agent_1:I did not know that.  Maybe that helps how he processes defense so well!? agent_2:Probably does.  He can remember exact in game scenarios and memorize moves in fighting games.	agent_1:Going back to Jordan, did you know that Air Jordan's were once banned by the NBA?
352	agent_1:Yes me as well! Tipping of ones hat arises from the knights raising their face visors. Very chivalry of them! agent_2:That's a very interesting fact. Did you know that until 1998 British politicians were required to wear a top hat if they were making a point of order? agent_1:Oh wow that seems kind of an old tradition. Kind of like that conical party hat which was derived from dunce caps!	agent_2:That's also a strange hat. As far as old traditions in British politics I don't understand why they still wear powdered wigs in court either. So strange.
69679	agent_1:children in need, I'm guessing across the world maybe? agent_2:Oh, okay. That's nice. Have you ever used a rotary dial phone? agent_1:Maybe when I was a kid! Have you?	agent_2:I sure have. The fastest number to dial on a rotary phone for an area code was 212 so it was assigned to New York.
58687	agent_2:I've been to the airport and Ann Arbor, but never Detroit itself.  Soon it will be all self driving cars, I'm looking forward to that, then I can read as I go. agent_1:The Tesla has Atari games, I think I would prefer that. McDonalds used to be so innovative, I have to wonder what happened. They invented the drive-thru, to accomodate soldiers who were not permitted out of their cars while wearing fatigues. agent_2:It's often funny how something we take for granted came about for an odd reason.  Supposedly the Google self driving car has a aggressive mode.  So we'll still have road rage.	agent_1:That doesn't surprise me at all.
146572	agent_1:Wow, well good that he stuck to football because it worked great for him agent_2:Yeah Im guessing it did, football players earn a lot of money so yeah,  agent_1:Yeah, how about eli manning, do you know him?	agent_2:Yeah his a great QB he has a genius level IQ so that's impressive.
12022	agent_2:I didn't know that.  I do know that parrots do have the ability to dance in time to music. agent_1:That is cool. Yeah Tupac practiced ballet agent_2:Wow, he was really a person of diverse talents.  I heard there was this one episode of Mr. Rogers where he learned to breakdance.  Id like to see that one.  It seems as out of place as Tupac and ballet	agent_1:I know and it is a diffucult type of dance too. they go through 4 pairs of shoes A WEEK
46165	agent_2:Yeah I think I have an addiction to clicking on internet links. It's a real addiction. agent_1:I have heard that constant novelty from clicking links on the internet can cause real addiction measurable in the brain! agent_2:Yes, unfortunately that's correct. But when I climb Mt. Everest I will not have to leave my addiction behind as there is 3g service up there.	agent_1:I have heard that! So much for getting away. Did you know the current library in Alexandria has saved a copy of the internet in case the internet ever burns down?
135740	agent_1:Is it? I didn't know that. They probably have that there too. I guess the internet would then be to search things up or entertainment. agent_2:Internet is also you for videocalls and sending photos. The things that you would send to others when your are on top of a mountain. Do you use videocalls ?  agent_1:If I could get reception, I think I would prefer videocalls and photos to contact my love ones than radio	agent_2:And they probably charge a lot, climbing the Everest is not for those who have a thin wallet.
74878	agent_2:Have you ever watched the movie Spartacus? Stanley Kubrick took over cinematography from the actual cinematographer he hired agent_1:That is cool and I do like that movie a lot. Who is your favorite cinematographer? I know that I really like Roger deakins agent_2:I really like James Wong Howe and his use of wide-angle lenses	agent_1:Yeah he was definitely a great innovator, very interesting that he married a white woman even though it was illegal back in 1948
112398	agent_1:That doesn't surprise me. Today, audiences want shows like South Park of The Simpsons.  Or even Pokemon, of which there are over 750 episodes, that works out to 50 a year for 16 years. agent_2:I can't believe the Simpsons has been going on for 30 years now. I don't know if they will ever end it.  agent_1:What's really hard to believe is that is only one episode that doesn't mention Bart and he doesn't appear.  Out of all those episodes, just one.  That's wild.	agent_2:That's just wild for sure. It was good talking to you!
58996	agent_2:Yes and the fact that they eat floating on their backs and using their stomachs as a table! agent_1:They are one of the cutest animals! agent_2:I saw them in an animal sanctuary once and they had set up a slide for them to play on. They were really taking advantage of it.	agent_1:Aww.  I  have always wanted to pet little otters.  Them and baby elephants.
157900	agent_2:I dont know,  Im guessing one of those cat doing dumb things videos lol agent_1:Yeah, or gangnam style or some song that the kids are listening to. i listen to old jazz. agent_2:Netflix and youtube make up half of peak internet traffic in north america lol	agent_1:That makes sense. people cannot turn off the video. they are hooked! Anyway, great chat!
89956	agent_1:Yeah and that makes sense right! they have 3g cell service at the top of Everest.  agent_2:Seriously? So you can climb a mountain and still be connected. I'm not sure if I love it or hate it. agent_1:Yeah i guess it doesn't matter because the mountain won, i'm not going up there. You know 7% of ppl read the terms and condition on internet purchases. 	agent_2:Yeah. I'm not either. And I never read that stuff. I see enough of it though I'm sure I'm addicted to online as constant novelty from clicking links on the internet can cause real addiction measurable in the brain.
127655	agent_1:Well it is better than urban decadence music aka jazz. Personally I like jazz, but henry ford helped spread country music to mitigate the spread of jazz agent_2:Really? I had no idea. As a jazz fan, I do not like that. Seems low key racist too. agent_1:True. I wonder if it was a race thing or talent thing why only 2 african americans are in the country music hall of fame	agent_2:Wow, that's not a lot. I would think there would be more. The stratocaster was intended for country!
60100	agent_2:Oh, it's interesting. I like it. agent_1:the second part talks about getting forecasts from Alexa. Do you have a home device like an echo? agent_2:No, i have not, but i like Alexa. 	agent_1:i don't either but i've used them before and they are convenient. how do you normally get the weather forecast?
11657	agent_1:I guess it is better to be prepared, just in case. Did you know sounds in Mars have a different pitch agent_2:That doesn't surprise me honestly.  Just as it would only take 2 or 3 days to get there if one traveled at constant 1G acceleration! Wonder if that's possible? agent_1:Science is moving pretty fast, you never know. And there seem to be organisms that can live in Mars like lichens and cyanobacteria	agent_2:Speaking of living on Mars, there's a reality show that's funding a colonization project aimed for 2023. That's going to be interesting to see. Ha!
155287	agent_2:The shooting in Pittsburgh was a terrible thing agent_1:i know about the article details  agent_2:These type of incidents are on the rise in the past two years	agent_1:ok please tell me above the article details
46843	agent_1:Yet it's still 330000 times the size of earth. The universe is amazing. agent_2:It really is! Theres a planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500mph in 2000 degree weather agent_1:Remind me to not put that on my vacation short list. YOu know Ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the son instead of Jupiter.	agent_2:That must be a big rock. I wonder how it compares to our moon
121408	agent_1:hi how are you? what do you think of elon musk? agent_2:I think his a genius, many people might hate him but I think he is really smart, what about you? agent_1:he is a genius. i like him because of his ambition. he is trying to do things that other companies refuse to try.	agent_2:Yeah like the race into space, if he has the money then let him help, Space X is a great company.
14531	agent_1:It is center of our solar system, but who hows how many galaxies there are out there.  Ours isnt even the largest. agent_2:Along the lines of the universe being inside a black hole, I had been under the impression that a black hole was the center of the universe. agent_1:It could be.  We dont truly know.  I think exploriation is so important.  I tend to believe that there is life other than us out there.  What if there is something more complex, thinking we arent intelligent life forms?	agent_2:As long as they look at our media they probably will think that.
100230	agent_2:I had no idea the reason. Have you ever know anyone who has been struck by lightening. I have known 2 people. One who swears he has been struck twice. But he has been known to tell a tale. I know for sure he has one time but the other...Not so sure. It is 5x hotter than the sun. agent_1:Wow I don't know anyone! Can't imagine. The sun also produces enough energy to meet the needs of the entire planet for 500,000 years! agent_2:That is good to know!  They always act like we won't have enough energy.	agent_1:Yes and we are already using solar panels. On July 11th, 2001 Neptune completed its first full orbit around the sun since its discovery in 1846!
51799	agent_2:Not offhand, no.  Although reading about it further, it seems they were just given Corvettes, so it may not have been such an advertising thing more than just being able to have the astronauts be seen with a new Corvette and use that as a status symbol. agent_1:true, and to show how elite those who traveled to space were agent_2:Personally, I'm not sure a new car would be worth the risk they took at the time.  Space is more of a passthrough, and not a destination.  I can't imagine having the military try and build stations for troop deployments in space.	agent_1:i certainly can't either. and anything dealing with space travel feels way too risky to me still
163113	agent_2:They have a minimum amount of native players they have to have? I never knew that. agent_1:Hm? no, i mean that in europe there are no restrictions. sorry. maybe i didnt make that clear. in japan they have lots of restrictions. in the us, no.  agent_2:Good to know. Thanks for clarifying. Im not smart so it's on me. Do you like soccer?	agent_1:yes, i do. its the most democratic of sports. minimal equipment, men and women, young and old.
88349	agent_1:The need to bring in some other good players though to help him like Durant agent_2:Leonard wants to join the Lakers. He wants to move back to LA. He's sick of San Antonio. agent_1:He would be a great addition and I think he would pair well with Lebron	agent_2:I agree! Keep the Lakers strong.
33878	agent_1:I think I would break something if I tried that but I do like watching good break dancers do their routine.s agent_2:Well, there are so many other types you could choose from.  anyone can learn to dance some form.  If a parrot can do it, then anyone can. agent_1:At most I manage to shuffle my feet from side to side. Course, if I've been drinking I become a virtuoso at least until the next day when friends laugh at me.	agent_2:Well even Emilia Clarke from Game of Thrones did the funky chicken and the robot dance in her audition tape.  You could try those dances.
13256	"agent_2:Haha. Too funny! There is a lady that can read 4700 words a minute! agent_1:I wonder how fast Tolkien and Lewis could read?  They used to read bad poetry together and have ""you laugh you lose"" competitions. agent_2:That must have been funny! Did you read Enders Game? "	agent_1:No I didn't.  That was suggested to military groups including the US Marine Corps.  Did you read it?
126130	agent_2:Oh, I love Judge Judy! Not only does she make a ton of money, but she actually works very little because it's such an easy show to produce. Definitely easier to make than something like Sesame street. agent_1:Exactly. Did you know Carol NBurnett was the first celebrity to apper in the show agent_2:I think it's great when celebrity comics known for more adult humor can find a younger audience, like Robin Williams did in Aladdin.	agent_1:Yeah, that is true. Do you know the Pixar studio?
152555	agent_2:That makes sense, considering the length of the career of a professional football player versus that of an engineer. But at least football players only have a season that runs from September to February, some even less than that! agent_1:They do have a shorter career. I suppose that is why they have to develop other interests, like on-line gaming. agent_2:Did you know women are technically allowed to play football?	agent_1:That is surprising. I guess all they have to do is meet the league's eligibility requirements, but I would bet they'd have a lot of opposition.
47152	agent_1:Interesting, well dogs can understand pointing instinctively, did you know that?  agent_2:I bet they are tuned into all kinds of human communication. Tone of voice, expression.  agent_1:Interesting. What about dance, are you interested? Tupac was a dancer. 	agent_2:I am a terrible dancer. I shouldnot dance within 200 yards of another person.
59771	agent_1:Agreed! If you also check out abstract art after watching a horror movie, they say you'll enjoy it more as well! agent_2:Interesting.  ET was originally supposed to be a horror movie. agent_1:Was it really? I could not see it that being scary! Something else I find crazy is the boy from The Shining named Danny didn't actually know he was acting in a horror film until years later. It's like, how did he never figure that out?	agent_2:It was originally written to be that, but they changed it.  I wonder what that little boy was thinking during the filming? lol
93208	agent_1:Apparently. I find it very depressing that in 39 out of 50 states the highest paid state employees are college football or basketball coaches.  agent_2:Yea that's a shame, plus players leave college to soon, 60% of NBA players are broke five years after retirement  agent_1:That's terrible. It happens  a lot to people that get rich quick. Poor money management. Are you familiar with Reggie Miller?	agent_2:Yea, he played for the Indiana Pacers and I think he was in the highest grossing basketball movie of all time Space Jam
127061	"agent_2:Not only the basketball coaches but football   coaches too.  Did you know that the Supreme court has a basketball court on the top floor, known as the "" highest court in the land?"" agent_1:I wonder if they use it a lot during their lunch breaks. Do you know what NZ basketball team are nicknamed? agent_2:Can you see Ruth Bader Ginsberg out on the court?  I heard it was the tall blacks, which is crazy."	agent_1:Yes that is it. DO you know reggie miller?
109634	agent_1:Yes I do. Did you know that women can play too ? agent_2:Did not know that, has anyone ever tried for the games? agent_1:I do not know but if they qualify then they are allowed to play	agent_2:Nice. Did you know they have put tracking chips on the players now?
114090	"agent_1:i never saw that movie. i think busta has been in a couple of movie. finding forrester? ?? agent_2:I'm not sure, but I do know that that a Korean rapper invented a new type of freestyle, it's called ""compliment battle"". agent_1:that must be a reflection of their culture. one of respect for your competitors. that is cool. i wonder what they compliment each other about."	"agent_2:Probably instead of hating each other, maybe.  I found out something else I didn't know before about the word, ""word"".  The word predates the musical form, and originally meant ""to strike"", and is now used to describe quick speech or repartee."
91874	"agent_1:ya I didn't know that, this says astronomers detected the building blocks of life 455 light years away, I wonder how they can tell that agent_2:Not sure, but strangely they say that Uranus rotates sideways and ""rolls"" around the sun instead of spinning. agent_1:hmmm that sounds cool id like to see a video of that in fast speed, this says there is a planet where shards of glass rain, which sounds metal as hell"	agent_2:I guess that Jupiter's moon is really huge because it would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun
92401	agent_2:Yeah they should have! Atleast they didn't attempt to try to buy the Eiffel Tower from a Frenchman who impersonated a government official. agent_1:I wish our government had done that rather than choose to own 86% of Nevada. That's our savvy government at work! agent_2:Yep! Did you know that Wikileaks published the governments plans to destroy Wikileaks? I'm guessing that plan failed.	agent_1:Yeah, but how is it that Wikileaks knows what the goverment is up to, when government employees don't even know?
36056	agent_1:Yeah we will have to see. Speaking of cold weather, have you ever seen the Disney movie Frozen? Came out in 2013 agent_2:I have seen it!  In Jan. of 2015 Frozen had become the all time best selling blu-ray disc in the U.S. agent_1:Yeah that is impressive. I never knew that it was actually based on a Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale called The Snow Queen, I'll have to check that out	agent_2:I didn't know that either.  Alan Tudyk has had a role in every Disney animated film since Wreck it Ralph, including the Duke of Weselton in Frozen.
125859	agent_1:I think the US should do as Istanbul does and have a vending machine of food and water for all the strays. What an amazing idea!  agent_2:Yeah I just saw a video on that. Pretty cool. I thought the dogs were being primed to bring the bottles to the machine but seems like they need humans to do it. agent_1:haha well that would be pretty amazing if they were! Out of all the animals, it's crazy to think  only dogs and elephants understand pointing! 	agent_2:I wonder why that is. The direct ancestor of the dog is extinct so maybe during the dinosaur days these first 'dogs' befriended cavemen who pointed at all the tigers trying to eat them
43233	agent_2:Yeah, one or twice, it's really fun actually. Interesting. he's been in so many movies with horses, from my memory, so that surprises me agent_1:Yeah, pretty crazy. I like the movie Unforgiven, he must have been taking meds for his allergies the entire movie! agent_2:Honestly, that wouldn't surprise me, and actually makes the most sense.	"agent_1:Yeah, it is pretty crazy. Apparently 2 high school kids rode their horses to school on ""no vehicles to school day"" and got suspended."
17665	agent_2:It's because they actually can play if needed. Can you imagine an old manager out there catching fly balls in the outfield? That'd be hilarious! Ha! agent_1:Yes, LOL, and I don't remember that happening! did you know what a very lucky man found in his grandfather's attic? agent_2:I heard it was $3 million worth in old 1900s baseball cards that were hidden there since the 1940s. It's like, I need to start checking attics then! Ha!	agent_1:You never know what you ca find!! Nice hidden inheritance from grandpa!!
45739	agent_2:You're fan of Lebron ? Or You just follow up because he's so famous and a skillful player ? agent_1:He's fine. I like Steph Curry too. He plays for Golden State. agent_2:Did You see any games live ?	agent_1:I did. I was hoping at least one of the guys would shoot granny style at the free throw line. It's supposed to be the most accurate way to shoot from there.
90404	agent_1:I haven't really listened to much but it seems quite interesting. Very free form music.  agent_2:I was surprised that the rapper, Tupac Shakur went to the Baltimore School of Arts where he studied ballet, acting, poetry, and Jazz. That's wild. agent_1:Jazz seems to be the root of a lot of modern music. It is really cool that such a well known artist studied it for his craft. 	agent_2:Yes, it is.  I read somewhere that Jazz great Ella Fitzgerald had taught herself to sing two notes at once by the age of 18.  That's impressive.
96804	agent_1:Many good ideas are out there! If you publish a book in Norway, the government will buy 1000 copies and distribute them to libraries throughout the country. agent_2:What if it is a bad book?  It would seem to be a waste of paper. agent_1:You've got a good point, hopefully they do a good job of screening them first.  Also, the Norway government will buy 1,500 if it's a children's book. I don't have the specifics on that one either.	agent_2:I'm not sure what the purpose of that would be. What if no one wanted to see it.
115889	agent_1:Its not a harmless promotion, but who cares its a free whopper lol agent_2:Yeah, did you know Facebook makes most if its money from ads that appear onscreen? agent_1:I didnt but it makes sense, they do make a lot of money out of advertisements- do you know why Facebook is primarily blue?	agent_2:Yes because Zuckerberg suffers from red-green colorblindness. I didn't even know there was such a thing.
87023	agent_1:That's interesting.  I would be curious.  There is only 2 African Americans in the country music hall of fame.  I wonder who they are? agent_2:I'm not sure either. I don't recall any African American artists in Country Music. Do you know what the fender stratocaster is? agent_1:I remember Charley Pride.  He might be one.  ...and yes!  it's a guitar.  I think a lot jazz and some blues musicians use it.	agent_2:Oh! Fender, I see that now! Thanks for clarifying! Do you play any instruments?
14276	agent_2:I believe physical humor is one of the oldest forms of comedy, at least on film. In the days of silent movies, for example, slapstick made a lot of sense because it didn't require sound. agent_1:Yes.  It was natural that slapstick was used then.  However, I just don't like it much.  What comedic movie have you enjoyed? agent_2:I guess I haven't seen that many, but I do sometimes watch comedy TV shows. Ever watch Third Rock from the Sun?	agent_1:Just a few times.  Of course, I did like Friends and Seinfeld in their times.  3rd Rock did make me laugh.  Do you subscribe to Netflix?
154429	agent_1:I think he is a horrible example of a president agent_2:At least he is fun to watch.I think senate wont let him to do much harm agent_1:We need to refer to him like Zimbabwe refers to theirs.	agent_2:How do they refer theirs?)
51600	agent_1:Me too!  I love Comedy Central! agent_2:You ever see the movie incredibles 2? agent_1:I havent.  I saw the first.  You?	agent_2:Yeah i did!  It's really good!  You should go and see it... it has a lot of comedy in it.
70670	agent_2:They have tons of computing power. More than the entire US nuclear ICBM deterrent system which is scary. agent_1:So scary! I need to do the UNICEF challenge where they donate clean water to kids for every minute you're not on your cellphone! agent_2:That's very awesome they do that. Good for them. 	agent_1:I'm going to go look into that. It was a pleasure chatting, have a great day!
21340	agent_2:just a little bit too old , not fan of pink floyd, i prefer peter gabriel  agent_1:Did you ever have the opportunity to go see him live? agent_2:no ,sadly no , how about u 	agent_1:I have only been to music festivals where multiple bands play but never a singular artist or bands concert
154557	agent_2:Hi! I love to watch football! I wish I could have seen Georgia Tech set the highest score record over Cumberland by beating them 222-0 back in 1916 though. I bet that was fun to watch. Do you watch football as well? agent_1:On the contrary, I would find it boring.  Cumberland players might be asleep while playing football. agent_2:You know, perhaps if Cumberland had to sit in a pink lockerroom like the visiting football team's locker room at the University of Iowa, they may have been a little more motivated. Ha!	agent_1:That was funny.  Yes, I heard about the University of Iowa's locker room for visiting teams.
26173	"agent_1:do you know In March 2014, he uploaded the song ""Vice City"" to SoundCloud, the free music-streaming platform agent_2:At the time of his death, Onfroy was awaiting trial. As news of the shooting broke, several celebrities and musicians shared their shock on social media agent_1:but quickly restored them after backlash from the music industry, which reportedly included artists such as Kendrick Lamar."	"agent_2:Rapping (or rhyming, spitting, emceeing, MCing) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates ""rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular"""
80148	agent_1:Yes phones have really progressed, nowadays there are people who haven't even used land lines never mind rotary phones. Iphones are all they know. agent_2:Yes.  Everyone has become so reliant on mobile phones.  It is nice to see Unicef offering to donate a day of clean water to children for every minute your cell phone is not used. agent_1:I wonder how they keep track of that? Nowadays no one using their phones for calling. I almost never do. Facebook for me is the preferred way of keeping in touch.	agent_2:Yes, use Facebook a lot too.  Great way to keep in touch.  I can never get over the fact that Myspace turned down an offer to buy it for $75 million!!
32667	agent_2:Me too, occasionally. The guy who started Netflix did so after he racked up $40 in late fees on a VHS rental of Apollo 13.  agent_1:Lol, that's crazy, and then Blockbuster declined to buy netflix multiple times for only 50 million agent_2:I know. I would be kicking myself right now if I was Blockbuster. But they had several offers so totally their loss. 	agent_1:Yep, blockbuster could of owned a company that along with youtube makes up half of peak internet traffic in North America
40940	"agent_1:That's because Elmo is dedicated to teaching children and making them happy! He encourages good behaviors like learning and reading. Congress, on the other hand...well, that goes back to ""shouldn't be around baseball bats,"" haha. agent_2:Yep.  The man whose surname is also Braille did a wonderful thing for teaching too.  I always think of Helen Keller... agent_1:That's an excellent point, and it also goes to show how important reading and language processing is for everyone, even someone who can't see or hear. Helen Keller was an inspirational speaker."	agent_2:I like stories like hers.  I makes me thing how easy I have it.  Unlike our pols who have a subway just to go to different offices in the same, albeit large, building.  If this is the last go-around, it was great chatting with you! You obviously have an abundance of grey matter.
2332	agent_1:Well for politicians image is everything. At least at some level of politics, the US has been quite progressive. For instance, Texas' first elected female governor came into office even before some states ratified the 19th amendment agent_2:Wow, I would not have thought that, especially with it being such a conservative state. I was sad when I learned that only one governor was against the internment of Japanese citizens during WWII.  agent_1:I understand the difficulties of a country given it is a melting pot and it can't let spies cause problems in WWII due to conflicting loyalties, but they didn't execute this process well and treated Americans of Japanese heritage unfairly. It is too bad only 1 governor was against their imprisonment. 	agent_2:I agree. What a horrible blight on our history.
99911	agent_1:Hello there, do you follow the NBA at all? agent_2:Hi, how are you? Sometimes I follow the NBA.  agent_1:Nice, I am well, I follow pretty closely.  My favorite team actually has the best record right now. 	agent_2:Which team is that? Is it GS?
89025	"agent_1:Absolutely. Supposedly, the US Supreme Court building has a basketball court called the highest court in the land.  agent_2:I want to see RBG jam. agent_1:I agree! Did you know that Lebron raised 6 mil for charity by televising ""the decision""."	agent_2:The man is a legend. He has done *so* much for charity. He has not forgotten where he came from.
81502	agent_1:I actually didn't. That's funny. Youtube is the second largest search engine on the net. agent_2:Yes it is. It was created by three former paypal employees in February 2005. agent_1:Who bought it from them? Didn't they sell it?	agent_2:Google did in November 2006 for 1.65 billion. Bet it's worth a lot more than that now.
67564	agent_2:Not until today!  I'm learning so much from these chats.  That's interesting.  I wonder if it only experiences seasons on the part that the sun shines on.  agent_1:IDK I know its so complex Its crazy agent_2:So interesting.  Around one in five sun-like stars is thought to have an Earth-sized planet in its habitable zone.  I wonder what grows on these stars?  Maybe this is where Actor and Actresses come from lol (Stars)	"agent_1:LOL Linkin park's ""hybrid theory"" is the best-selling album of the 21st century."
56048	agent_2:I don't have any, but several family members do, and I love to play with them. What kind of dog do you have? agent_1:I have a Hungarian Vizsla. He is 3 years old. agent_2:Vizslas are very athletic dogs, aren't they?	agent_1:Yes he has a lot of energy! He still acts like a puppy. But he is the sweetest dog. Do you have cats?
84076	agent_1:I didn't know that. I guess I'll have to try that sometime haha. Have you seen the movie The Shining? agent_2:Yes, I have. Great film! Based on a King novel. agent_1:Yep you're right. I was glad to hear that the little boy from it, Danny, never knew that he was in a horror movie as a kid. he only later found out as an adult	agent_2:I wonder what kind of movie he thought it was. He probably never read the novel. Too scary for a child.
74793	agent_1:yeah if the radio can catch them they have to be agent_2:Do you know that by Canadian law, at least 40% of all music played  on the radio must be Canadian.  What a law. agent_1:yeah talk about supporting local and national talent	agent_2:But, hey I like Celine Dion, I can't really think of any other Canadian artist.
79136	agent_1:Yep, pretty awesome he did that. I read that if you publish a book in Norway the government will buy 1000 copies to donate to libraries throughout the country  agent_2:I agree, that is awesome.  There are more libraries than McDonalds.  Never would have guessed that agent_1:That's crazy. I had no idea about that. 	agent_2:You can check out a sewing machine in the Sacramento Library
97113	agent_2:Yeah they did. They had the chance to buy them for only 50 million. And now Netflix is worth 2 billion! That's insane agent_1:I guess a lot of people underestimated Netflix. Their stock was like $10 a share back in the day. Now it's really gone up. The origins of the company are interesting to me. Reed Hastings must have been very upset! agent_2:Haha you're right. To think that Netflix started because of a late fee for keeping Apollo 13 too long LOL that is a good movie though	agent_1:Great film. Late fees suck. Netflix solved that problem. People need convenience.
83935	agent_2:The show really was about Bart and his hijinks. I think it's funny that That 70's Show was remade verbatim in the UK and flopped. Something about casting didn't work, I think. agent_1:Those things rarely do. The only one I can think of that really did was The Office. Did you happen to see the Family Guy episode of South Park? agent_2:I did. It was the one when the manatees were fetching balls to make up a story line. Good episode.	agent_1:It was hilarious. After that episode aired, The Simpsons crew sent flowers to the South Park office which is find very funny.
98428	agent_1:I know there were options in the language settings that were jokes like turning everything into pirate speak at one point. agent_2:i remember the pirate english one! i loved using that back in the day, it was so fun agent_1:I tried it for a little while but it made it a little complicated.	agent_2:it did, but it was a fun joke for a bit for high school me
52807	agent_1:Haha, that's really funny! I bet he felt weird about that! So I was reading about Kevin Durant and something about the NBA, not sure what it is all about yet, have you heard anything? agent_2:I am a Thunder fan so I have mixed feelings about Durant.lol agent_1:Yeah, I get that. He seems to be pretty upset.Durant has gotten pretty upset several times before and heads for the Twitter lol....that gets him into not water.	agent_2:Yeah, he has a hot hand everywhere,lol. Speaking of rich people did you hear Judge Judy makes $123,000 for each episode she makes?
35386	agent_1:Yeah it would be a really good mashup. I wish I would have went to the high school Jay Z went to. Notorious B.I.G., Busta Rhymes, and DMX were all alums there. agent_2:I would have liked to be in the lunchroom at the time Jay Z had a rap battle with Busta Rhymes agent_1:That would have been epic, I wonder who won?	agent_2:Considering they're all well-known, they both did. Have you heard any songs from Jay Z's album Kingdom Come?
89048	agent_2:I did not know that YMCA invented basketball.  Thanks for the info.  By the way, do you know that the dunk was banned from college basketball for over a decade? agent_1:Apparently Kareem Abdul-Jabbar dunked excessively during his college days.  But, what do you expect from someone who is over 7 feet tall? agent_2:I know, right.  I think it's not banned anymore now. You know much more about basketball, I would love to hear more interesting facts.	agent_1:I mentioned earlier that James Naismith invented basketball in a MA YMCA.  Did you know that when he was the coach at University of Kansas, he was the only losing coach in the school's history?
61518	agent_1:No not really. THey named a building after a guy that was the first customer though agent_2:That's pretty cool. So what do you normally look for on Amazon? agent_1:I actually buy a lot of books but also household stuff. And it is nice that they deliver on SUndays too now	agent_2:Yea that was great when they added that! I usually use it for electronics as it is the cheapest way to buy most of them.
139463	agent_2:they can also help with hunting, herding,  and even helping the police. agent_1:And it is more common for them to aid in therapuetic roles, like PTSD and visiting elder care homes. agent_2:Isn't that amazing they are also great companions and protectors!	agent_1:I can't believe the dogs we have in our home today is loosely related to the wolf.
159215	agent_1:Isn't that funny!  I bet they all got a good laugh out of it! agent_2:Im glad none of them take tv jokes too serious. I think that our current president might have a problem with this agent_1:Geez yeah I can't agree with you more on that, I don't like the way he handles jokes. 	agent_2:How do you think he would take it knowing he's not one of the 3 wealthiest presidents
58595	agent_2:You're right, and technology just keeps getting better. I thought Mortal Kombat was so realistic looking when I first played it. Mortal Kombat is the reason for the video games rating system! agent_1:That is the one where one character rips out and eats the loser's heart right?  agent_2:Hahaha true! I wonder if that was banned in Australia, which has more video games banned than China.	agent_1:I mean regardless, we play at least 3 billion hours per week as a planet. Not a year, not a month, but per WEEK!
151639	agent_2:The sexist attitudes need to change. the league has its priorities upside down. criminal behavior is tolerated, but political protest isnt. agent_1:I agree 100%! Have you heard about the technology that the NFL uses? agent_2:Um, the tracking chips? i would like to know who gets the data and how they use it.	agent_1:It is interesting that they put the tracking chips in player shoulder pads to track their every move. I guess it must help with game plans.
92365	agent_2:Very cool. In Instanbull they have vending machines for dogs.  agent_1:THe ones that dispense food when you feed it plastic bottles? agent_2:Yeah those. See, there's a lot to write about when it comes to dogs. I'm reading Warlight by Ondaatje. But I think its more of a cat person novel	agent_1:Nice. Did you kmnow google says that they are a cat company?
103755	agent_2:Did you know that the only US president to ever have a Phd was Woodrow Wilson? I thought that there would be more. agent_1:I did not know that! It should almost be a requirement at this point. History and politics and some form of a degree sounds like something that the person holding the nuclear codes for the country should have... agent_2:I agree, especially when the president is focusing more on their personal affairs rather than the country *cough* Trump *cough*.	agent_1:Exactly! Anymore i just make popcorn when I watch the news, it's a fanfare! But, funny fact... once the president of Indonesia released 3 pop albums while in office. I mean, I wonder if they were good? I would not want certain *cough cough* people to do that. Who knows what that would sound like. Maybe that goat screaming in that Taylor swift song, but just the goat...
68585	agent_2:I'm not sure it is true, I don't believe it.  agent_1:Green Lantern was originally going to be a comedy with Jack Black in it. I think that would have made it better. agent_2:I've never seen it, was it any good? I think it ended up staring Ryan Reynolds right? 	agent_1:Yeah, pre-Deadpool. He's come a long way since that Pizza place sitcom. Ever seen Kung Fu Hustle?
84187	agent_1:That process is never going to reverse itself. When the aliens finally visit us, they will be shocked at what we've done. agent_2:They will be, they wont think we are the intelligent life theyve been looking for, agent_1:We will have someone to deal with them though. The UN appointed official ambassador to extraterrestrials in they case they would ever make contact with earth	agent_2:That must be a hard job to explain to your friends.  LOL
110589	agent_2:I've heard that to get the extreme lean in those moves, he had a patent on a device. I wonder how it works agent_1:It was a slot in his shoe that hooked to a nail in the floor, creating that really cool lean effect.  Smooth Criminal was the video I think. agent_2:Wow! That's smart. Even Bruce Lee has had some great dancing back in his day. Back in 1958, he won the ch-cha championship in Hong Kong	agent_1:You certainly know a lot about dancing!  I did not know that about Bruce Lee, but it doesn't surprise me because most Martial Arts are very dance like involving routines.
101618	agent_2:No, I did not know that.    Which one?    Ballast Key? agent_1:Yes, you got it. He did by it to protect it. He did not like seeing people cutting mangroves that took a long time to grow.  agent_2:They renamed is at David Wolkowsky key.	agent_1:Well, he paid for it! He could not have lived to see the change because five years have to pass after a person dies before a name change could be considered!
123149	agent_2:I have been to Holland but that predated the technology that allows trains to go at that speed.. agent_1:My traveling is limited to the Travel Channel on TV. You have much time to watch television during all your journeys? agent_2:Not a big fan of the small screen.  You wanna know who travels a lot?  Amazon warehouse workers.  They walk 7 to 15 miles a day as part of their daily shift.  Crazy right!?	agent_1:That Jeff Bezos has really got them hopping!
61962	agent_2:Yes sometimes I do. DId you know in Norway if you publish a book the government buys the first 1000 copies of it agent_1:Yes and they give them away to the libraries in the country agent_2:Yes such a good plan, support the author and the libraries as well	agent_1:Yes I know. There are more libraries than McDonald's in  the US
106571	agent_1:I like some dramas like House. Did you know that Hugh Laurie earns over $700,000 per episode of House? agent_2:Wow that's nuts! It says he's the highest paid actor ever for a TV drama. agent_1:I know that's pretty wild! I'm kind of glad that Jim Carrey doesn't make dramas anymore. He says that his belief system prevents him from playing in movies that don't project positivity. 	agent_2:He has a very odd belief system from what I've read about him before. There is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free.
50125	agent_2:I live in the city so there's lots to do. I love comedies, whether it's at the theater, on TV, movies, or a comedy club. agent_1:The last live comedy I saw was a local high school play.  Not very good, but they really tried.  I like British comedies on PBS.  Did you know that Brits, in Caesar's day, bred chickens for entertainment and not food?  I wonder what that was about! agent_2:That is pretty weird! I wonder if it had anything to do with python programming being named after the british comedy group.	"agent_1:British comedy is definitely different than American comedy.  Each are good, in their own way.  One of my favorite U.S. comedies was ""3rd Rock from the Sun"".  Did you know that it beat Seinfeld, Friends, and Frasier for the Golden Globe for Best Comedy Series in 1997?"
98501	agent_1:What's that now?  What do they constitute warming?  Obviously 20 min, but I wonder if they would allow 5 min to warm the car?  Speaking of cars and warm, in South-Africa it's legal to put flame-throwers on your car to prevent carjacking!!! agent_2:I want a flamethrower to melt snow, especially behind me! agent_1:I'd like to melt snow all around me!!	agent_2:Apparently Google's self driving cars have an aggressive mode, I wonder what that means.
123277	agent_1:I'm not sure what the first ever purchased was. But I do know that the first customer got a building named after him. agent_2:That was it!  They paid $27.95 I guess to have a building named after themselves.  agent_1:Very cool. I would probably do the same. Amazon warehouse worker sure to walk a lot. Between 7 and 15 miles each day all a part of their daily shift.	agent_2:That is quite a bit, I wouldn't think a warehouse job you would walk that much.
131051	agent_2:she sure is. she cuts through the noise and gets to the heart of the matter. I dont get to watch her much, but she sure can run a court room. agent_1:Well even though LeBron James is very rich, he raised 6 million dollars for charity. agent_2:he is a generous guy off the court. he has donated money to help kids get a college education. i wish other athletes did the same thing.	agent_1:That is really nice. I hope NBA player Allen Iverson donated some of his money. He signed a contract that would pay him $800,000 a year until he is 55 and then receives a final lump sum of 32 million.
106648	agent_1:They used razorblades and pencils, pretty creative agent_2:WOw nice. Do you know much about word governments? agent_1:I sure do. Have you heard of wikileaks?	agent_2:I have but do not know too much about them
134669	agent_2:Yeah that was a suprising fact for me as well, did you hear about that vending machine in Istanbul? agent_1:Yea, it's awesome Istanbul uses the vending machine to give food and water to stray dogs agent_2:I think thats a great way to keep the city clean and also keep doggies fed	agent_1:Did you know that dogs and elephants are the only known animals to instinctively understand human pointing?
141087	agent_1:I'm sorry, I have that backwards. Suppossidly if you watch a horror movie before viewing abstract art you will enjoy the art more. agent_2:Wow, I will have to try that before I go to the Art Museum. The majority of the creepy metal noices are made by a waterphone. I had no clue. agent_1:I'd like to see a waterphone. The kid from the Shining didn't know he was in the movie until several years later. That's probably best he didn't know.	agent_2:Yeah. I can see someone getting messed up being in a seriously disturbing film. I guess that happened with Jim Carrey and Andy Kaufman when he did that film.
65812	"agent_1:I had a typo.  I left the ""m"" off of men.  To change the subject, did you know that Netflix accounts for 33 percent of all bandwidth in North America? agent_2:Good, the topic about animal is to confusing to me.  Yes, I heard about that.  I think I'm included in the 33%. agent_1: I often am also.  I can't believe that I can't fix my typo.  I left the ""n"" off of men.  One of the horrible mistakes of US business is when Blockbuster did not buy Netflix for $50 million since it is now worth $2  billion."	agent_2:Now, Blockbuster is gone.  They should have bought Netflix. Some people were angry with themselves out there.
50523	agent_1:Heard about, but never saw the video game. I was surprised to learn that one of my favorite actresses, Holly Hunter (Million Dollar Baby; best actress) did a voice in Incredibles  I & II. Samuel L. Jackson, too. Who knew? agent_2:That is cool. The events in the incredibles are also set in the 1960s, that is pretty wild. agent_1:Agreed. Grew up then! In real life, entertainment was different then. It's accelerated today.	agent_2:I agree. I found out recently that Sarah vowell, the voice of violet parr, is also a political commentator and bestselling author.
116595	agent_1:A lot of them. He was a lifeguard for the Skokie Park District. Failed a lot... agent_2:Are you talking about Ronald Reagan, our former president? agent_1:Yes, yes I am. I recently read his biography and it was in there.	agent_2:I see.  The reason why I mentioned it is because he tried to get a presidential role and the movie producer indicated that he did not look presidential enough. I think it was funny since he later on became our president.
67686	agent_2:It is indeed. Do you like dramas? agent_1:Yes I like dramas. House is one of my favorites. agent_2:Did you know Hugh Laurie earns $700,000 per episode in House?	agent_1:No, that's a huge amount, but considering what baseball players make I guess it's not out of line.
12498	agent_1:Yes!  The cats, the videos, the cat videos to pass the time away!  I sometimes get lost on Reddit looking at Memes and some of them also include cats... agent_2:My favorite cat memes are the ones where they defy gravity and have no legs. Surprisingly despite dogs being man's best friend, there are more pet cats than dogs agent_1:I would love to see the metrics on that stat about cats v. dogs - my main question revolves around the fact that if cats could talk, they would dispute being a pet and think that the human is their pet!	agent_2:Well thinking that way are we really the pets and our pets the master? After all, we provide them with shelter, luxurious food, and they pretty much don't even have to work for anything much less like us. Hmm going into some very dark territory.
111490	agent_1:That is pretty wild when you think about.  Did you know the sun itself accounts for 99% of the total mass of our solar system? agent_2:that is amazing, you would think it would be less agent_1:Right, and again when you think of it like that, you really start to feel small in all the vastness. 	agent_2:Another big number that will makes us feel small is the sun's mass! 330,000 times the mass of the earth
45654	agent_1:Nice!  I wonder if there are any vinyl lovers that cringe when they hear the scratching that DJs do? agent_2:I know I do lol.  Even worse was when the tapes jammed in the players! agent_1:Have a pen or pencil handy?  How many times I had to thread it back through.  Now it's so convenient with MP3s.  I wouldn't trade it, but I miss going to the record shop.	agent_2:Do you dance, did you know Bruce Lee was a champion dancer?
152408	agent_1:Hey there do you have a favorite quarterback? They use quarterbacks in both American and Canadian football agent_2:Hi! I do happen to favor Trubisky, especially after he threw six touchdowns in one half against the Bucs. What about you? agent_1:That is really good. I like Tom Brady a lot myself. I just think he's so good that it's undeniable. But it is weird that you've never eaten a strawberry before LOL	agent_2:Oh, there's no doubt Brady is one do the best! He is another favorite of mine. Can you believe his JV high team refused to start him when he was a backup after they lost every single game and failed to score a touchdown? That is almost infuriating! As a fan or player of that team, I would have been irate!
62053	agent_2:I did. The NES was my first console agent_1:Apparently, it only had 54 colors. Crazy, isn't it?  agent_2:It actually surprises me. Considering how limited tech was back then	agent_1:yeah, it is pretty crazy, but they were fun games to play too.
83003	agent_2:I loved Narcos but haven't watched the current season. I saw the Bundy Tapes on there and was intrigued but didn't click on it. Is it really good? agent_1:Oh , you must watch the next season of Narcos it only gets better! Yes, The Bundy Tapes has me hooked. I am intrigued with true life crime shows. I am so glad Reed Hastings started Netflix lol I don't even have Cable anymore. agent_2:Who is reed hastings? Did you watch to catch a killer? 	agent_1:Reed Hastings is the man who after getting 40 bucks in late fee's from a video store he came up with the idea of Netflix and then started it up. I did watch that, and Making a Murderer. Some shows I watch on the internet through an app too.
28616	"agent_2:ya I wonder if most of that bandwidth is just from fireplace videos haha, do you know that netflix pays people to just tag the content of netflix videos? they're called ""taggers"" haah agent_1:Thats neat. I wonder if they spend more on that then they do postage. Which is 20 times more than they do bandwidth agent_2:ya that would add up fast! I like good movies, I guess Netflix has 150 movies with a perfect 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, I need to watch them all"	agent_1:That's a good amount of movies. Are any of them walt disney movies?
73838	agent_2:Maybe he just likes living a private life or isnt a part of Google anymore, you know new employees at googles are called nooglers. agent_1:I did not know that.  Why are they called nooglers? agent_2:No idea, its just a nickname but they make them wear a funny beanie cap on their first friday, I think thas kind of messed up lol	agent_1:They are just having fun.  Anyway, I've got to run. Nice chatting with you.
70768	agent_2:Being a teacher is rewarding.  I think Patrick Stewart teaches master classes for drama students in the UK.   agent_1:Especially for students who actually want to learn something! I think Gordon Ramsey is also a great mentor and teacher to many people. agent_2:Oh don't get me started on Ramsey.  I love all his shows and yes he's a great teacher.  It's like watching soap operas.  Did you know that soap opera's originated from dramas that were sponsored by soap manufactures?	agent_1:Glad to know there's someone out there who admires Ramsey as much as I do, though I've never eaten at any of his restaurants. Really? are they still sponsored by soap manufactures?
6668	agent_1:I didn't but that makes sense, have you checkout out the police version of youtube, blutube? agent_2:I have heard of it but now seen it. I just can't believe the amount of content, in 2017 there were 400 hours of content uploaded every minute, so crazy. agent_1:that is crazy, also I remember when Gangnam Style came out and Youtube had to upgrade itself to handle the traffic	agent_2:I remember that too. Do you know what the most disliked video on YouTube?
143259	agent_1:Yes, I was listening to the news earlier this morning had learned that a man in France managed to impersonate a government official and even sold the Eiffel Tower twice! That kind of shows that something's wrong with the system and who are those buyers?! agent_2:Ya this was definitely a very interesting con. I happened a while ago agent_1:The government of France shall learn a thing or two from the Norwegian government who has donated a billion dollars to help save the Amazon rainforest!	agent_2:I wonder how much of a difference that billion made
19953	agent_1:I think they have probably found some type of life other than on earth, I guess I believe so much that there has to be life out there so yes I believe the government knows and hides facts. I think Area 51 is one of the places that have some facts.... agent_2:i agree. it seems far fetched to think that ALL that we have heard is fiction.  i guess the government hides facts because they think we'll be freaked out if we know some things that are, in fact true. agent_1:Exactly! Some extreme 	agent_2:and then we get to the question of whether the government should hide things from us.  even if those things are scary, do we have the right to know? it's one of those debateable issues.
127088	agent_1:Really, I think James Naismith invented it, was it at the YMCA. I like watching it NBA and college agent_2:My mistake.  I like watching college too.  I like when players such as Tim Duncan stay in school to get their degree before going to the nba. agent_1:Right, if i remember right, it was his last promise to his dying grandma. People like that make it awesome!	agent_2:They really do.  Especially when you think about how 60% of players are broke after retirement.
104454	agent_2:Hi. I find the game fascinating. There are so many good players. It is really fun to watch since it is such a fast paced game.  agent_1:I love the NBA too. I saw that Reggie Miller has a sister who is better as basketball then he is. agent_2:Oh wow that is cool! I bet growing up they played a lot. It probably helped him become the player that he became. I wonder if she plays for the WNBA?	agent_1:I bet. I think she does play in the WNBA, but not 100% certain on that.
10272	agent_1:A man in France pretended to be a government official, and sold the Eiffel Tower not once, but twice. Maybe he could sell the land in Nevada for the US government and then the proceeds could go to the Amazon. agent_2:Sounds like a plan... He could get in the business of selling used ballet shoes.  They can go through 4 pairs a week. agent_1:Four pairs. I wonder how they would do with the 5000 year old shoes though.	agent_2:Their toes much suffer too.  Maybe there should be ballet boots.  If they fall, they can pull themselves up by their bootstraps.
12676	"agent_1:I have never watched a pro game, and was surprised to learn that we call it ""soccer""' when it is really football. agent_2:Well Im sure you know who jon stewart is from the daily show. He represented the US at the pan american maccabi games in brazil all the way back in 1983. agent_1:I do not know who he is. Did they play with three teams on the field at the same time?"	agent_2:I think most games are played with only two teams. Although there is a variation of the games that utilizes three teams in one game.
78188	agent_1:I love youtube. Created back in 2005 it wasn't always so big but sure is now! agent_2:I guess it's the whole thing of having videos on demand.  I even find myself watching concert on Youtube. agent_1:Oh nice I've never watched a concert on YouTube. Although I did watch Justin Bieber's baby video on YouTube and it is the most dislike video on there.	agent_2:I suspect that is more to do with people being jealous of his popularity than a dislike of that individual video, I seen far worse than that.
44447	agent_2:I can believe it, I think a lot of people are addicted to social media. agent_1:I think so too. The library of Alexandria saves a copy of the internet in the event it were to burn down. agent_2:That must take up a ton of space, I bet a lot of people would like some of the things they put online erased!	agent_1:I'm sure. Did you know there is 3g cell service at the peak of Mt. Everest?
150903	agent_1:Are you a big football fan? agent_2:Yes, I love football. What about you? agent_1:I enjoy watching it. The Eagles and Patriots will be a good game. Nick Foles completed 26 passes for 352 yards and 3 touchdowns. Brady has been lacking this year..	agent_2:The Patriots have a poor pass defense.
139351	agent_2:It will really make you reminisce about how simple the 90s were once you start seeing how life was back then agent_1:I do remember that feeling. I miss those days. These days everyone is glued to their phones. agent_2:Exactly when was the last time people out at a restaurant were actually having a conversation instead of staring at their phones	"agent_1:Right. It's sad but ineivitable I guess. Anyway, Tupac Shakur's contributions were very important, I guess. His music is in the library of congress of ""cultural significance."""
13542	agent_1:Was he really?  Why was he afraid of children? agent_2:Because of their unpredictability. I wonder if he ultimately had any kids... agent_1:I don't know.  It's interesting that children scared him and yet he wrote such wonderful books for them.	agent_2:He was one of the first persons to use the word nerd.It was first used in the book If I Ran the Zoo.
128716	agent_1:Yes because he said albums should not be sold piece by piece agent_2:Yeah I guess that makes sense. He was also a ghostwriter for space jam agent_1:Yeah. Do you know why he named the album Kingdom Come?	agent_2:Oh that was from the DC series with the same name where superman comes back to teach the young ones how it is done
10709	agent_1:I was a big Lion King fan, have you seen it? agent_2:No they haven't come out with the Remake yet. But I did see the stage show and I also saw a movie which are both great. Julie Taymor directed the Broadway musical by the way agent_1:They made it dubbed in zulu for african release, that was nice of them	agent_2:Yes I agree. I also like how revolutionary Disney was with their use of multi-plane cameras, that really adds to an animated scene and they used it in Bambi
134071	agent_2:I stay away from politics, haha. I'm not sure, who were the top three richest? agent_1:Yes the three richest we're JFK, Jefferson, and Washington, Im with you on the politics though. I don't really like talking about it myself. What do you think about President banana of Zimbabwe though haha? agent_2:I haven't heard of President Banana! And that is interesting to know they were the richest. And the only president to have a PhD is Woodrow Wilson.	agent_1:That is interesting. And yes I don't know why Trump isn't in that list, but I guess he was not one of the top three haha. Have you ever visited the White House by the way?
143721	agent_1:Me too and I agree on that. Cadillac was named after a French explorer. agent_2:That is very interesting, I think that he founded the city of Detroit if I'm correct as well.  agent_1:Yep, he did find Detroit also. It was good chatting with you!	agent_2:I wonder if most people that live in Detroit know about that fact?
8207	agent_1:I'm sure it must have taken forever. On the other hand, the Japanese alphabet is naturally a poem when recited in order. agent_2:I think you mean the Javanese alphabet. The Japanese alphabet wouldn't work. Do you get a chance to go to concerts much? agent_1:Oh I think you're right! And I do sometimes! I saw Linkin Park in 2001, I thought it was very unique until finding out they had almost 324 concerts just that year.	agent_2:They were on a tear, weren't they. I think they must have made a ton a cash that year. The following album must have had high expectations. I couldn't tour like that.
94548	agent_1:Oh wow!! That is awesome!! I do a lot of thrift shop stuff, too. I collect all different editions of Alice in Wonderland, and thrift shops are the best places to find old copies. agent_2:Nice! Yeah and I'm sorry, it was called a short history of the world from 1919.  Do you use google much? agent_1:I do! I love that I can just click the little microphone and verbally ask my questions of google on my PHONE. haha. Sorry. Gah. It really is awful how much we rely on our phones. But I do. I'm not sure that I could actually do my job without google maps. Because I work quite a ways away from my home, I don't know my way around too much. So I rely heavily on google maps.	agent_2:Yeah and we rely on google I think even when we don't realize.  They own a ton of things, YouTube for instance.
11391	agent_2:I wonder how big they were?  Possibly even larger than today's 9 foot tall ostrich. agent_1:Impressive!  So, if birds can learn to mimic chainsaws, I wonder if they can learn to rap?  I would love to hear a cockatiel freestyle a compliment battle with some Korean rappers! agent_2:Oh my, so would I!  If they could do that then i bet their music would make it into the Library of Congress right along with Tupac Shakur.	"agent_1:For certain! ""Who let the birds out? Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet!"" Now that would be culturally significant!"
71418	agent_1:That's innovative. I wonder if it will work. It may cause addiction from all the clicking though... agent_2:I think the problem with balloons is they are hard to keep up, so its makes it less reliable than satellites, which can cover large areas more easily agent_1:I would find the lack of internet in some places a peacefulness I would look forward too at times.	agent_2:True, but sometimes say there is a natural disaster in a rural area, communication can be difficult
119518	agent_2:It is so sad that we can't have the same perspective. Always so divided and I might blame it to the news and TV shows. I think we will be better if we promote positive shows like Mr Rogers neighborhood. Love him! agent_1:I used to work in DC, just a few block from the White House, got to see many of the political leaders. agent_2:Oh. Do you work for the government or a company? 	agent_1:Actually a book store on K street.  We did book signings for many political candidates and US Senators.
96030	agent_2:Probably one of the Kardashians lol  agent_1:Again, I can't argue with your guess.  The money some celebrities make is mind boggling.  Judge Judy $123,000 per episode is astounding. agent_2:Thats is a nice pay check!  that is a good show lol	agent_1:I'm trying to add up in my head how many episodes that must have been on for, it's been on for years.  Pokemon made 750 episode, but I think Judge Judy must be getting close to that.
58925	agent_2:Their guitarist, Matthew Bellamy apparently holds the Guinness record for most guitars smashed on a tour. Punk-type band? agent_1:More, indie rock, alternative rock.  Like to read? agent_2:Yes! Not a speed reader, though.	agent_1:Me either. The record holder can read 4,700 words per minute.
155311	agent_2:I don't either, it raises my blood pressure. I did used to watch the Simpsons with my kids, did you see where they threatened to sue themselves to stop the Simpson's from parodying Fox News? agent_1:I can believe that. It shows that they actually separate the departments though! agent_2:Yes, have you followed the anti-vax movement? Fox spread a lot of it, I see where that guy with adult measles blamed his parents for his problems. It's hard to combat the anti-vax crowd on Fox and elsewhere.	agent_1:I thought they were pro-vaccination if I remember correctly.
141676	agent_1:Hello,  how are you ? Mcdonalds' added drive-thru in 1975 to accommodate soldiers who were not allowed to get out of their cars while wearing their fatigues. agent_2:That was a smart move on their part. Now, drive-thrus are popular with so many people- it may even be encouraging people to not get up and walk around!  agent_1:Well it works well for people who have kids and handicap and other circumstances,  but yeah it has made America lazy. The trunk of your car is called that because old cars used to have wooden trunks on the back.	agent_2:Nowadays it would be the place that I keep my flamethrower. Do you have a flamethrower on your car? It might be useful in certain places.
118812	agent_2:If a human was uploaded to a computer, could you be programmed to be happy or drunk.  No russian would do it.  There is no vodka in cyber space.  agent_1:hey there could be! they could be programmed to always have a bottle of vodka on hand agent_2:They could also be programmed to be a sensor inside a football.  They would have to track velocity, rotation and the number of cheerleaders. 	agent_1:maybe theyll get to walk on the moon someday like the scientist Harrison Schmitt
87601	agent_1:Today some latest technology are used to protect our vehicle but the thieves are more smart. agent_2:They indeed are more smart. They can even get into the trunk pretty easily. The trunk is actually named that because old cars had wooden trunks on the bad. agent_1:Celebrity refers to the fame and public attention accorded by the mass media.	agent_2:I actually knew that one. Did you know judge Judy make 123000 per episode or rather she used to. I heard she retired.
134127	agent_1:I use it quite often as well. Are you familiar with how it works? agent_2:Kind of, I know it gets by cable to my home and I have a router that distributes the wireless signal agent_1:Same. I recently learned that the internet is a system of interconnected computer networks using TCP/IP to link devices worldwide 	agent_2:Yeah it carries a lot of information, music, documents, videos, you name it. I dont know what I would do without internet in my life, Ive gotten so used to it by now it feels like a basic need
59014	agent_1:Yeah I don't know about that. Doesn't sound too appealing to me haha. Did you know that if a cat is 15 years old then it has slept for about 10 years of its life LOL I wish that my life for that way I love to sleep agent_2:Me too, but I would hate to come home to pee stained curtains! Yuck! agent_1:Haha I agree with you! Did you know there's a town in Alaska that has a cat as its mayor? It's been the mayor since 1997, and must be doing a great job lol	agent_2:How does a cat even run for mayor? Don't you need to sign things?  However, I guess they can be mayor if they can coauthor books...
1603	agent_2:That's cool. A Harlem woman has held free jazz concerts in her apartment for 20 years now. agent_1:Neat!  I bet that is a pain to drag up the guitars and piano  up there. agent_2:I bet so too. Pakistan has a jazz orchestra.	agent_1:Interesting.  I don't think of jazz when I think of Pakistan.
68895	agent_1:Do you own a car/ agent_2:Hello, I do, what about you? agent_1:I have a car, I wish I could equip a flame thrower on it like South Africa can lol	agent_2:That would be hilarious. Looks like it's to deter carjacking.
32138	"agent_2:Really?  The Koreans have a form that is a ""compliment battle""  I would like to see Trump and Pelosi engage in that. agent_1:If they had a korean compliment battle I think it would end in a stalemate agent_2:I agree.  It would be a silent album."	"agent_1:It would still sound better than Nicki Minaj's album ""Queen"""
77986	agent_2:Yeah I heard it was started because the founder racked up 40 dollar late fees on a copy of apollo 13 agent_1:Yes, Netflix and Youtube together make up half to internet traffic in the north america. Mostly people use both entertainment media to watch latest news and short videos.  agent_2:I know I use it an awful lot.	agent_1:Mostly they are watching movie in Netflix avoid going to threatre.
116163	agent_1:That's cool.  Do you know the current Library of Alexandria has a copy of the internet, in case it burns down? agent_2:I saw that, Lets hope it doesn't, lol we all wouldn't know what to do! agent_1:Lol, talk about being lost.  Do you realize that only 7% of people read the full terms when buying a product or service on the internet?	agent_2:I believe that, they make them so long and hard to read. Good to know Mt. Everest has cell service. Great chat!!
48409	agent_1:Haha yeah he must have! Another surprise dancer was Tupac who did ballet. agent_2:tupac was the man. he could do so many things. ballet? im a bit surprised. agent_1:Yeah back in his highschool days. He acted and danced in the nutcracker.	agent_2:he must have been quite graceful. i bet he didnt want people to see him that way later though.
115230	agent_1:Yes, people like him make a huge difference.  Ironically, Billy Moore who was in prison 20 years helps and coaches at IMAN to help reclaim lives, but his own son was shot and murdered shot 16 times. agent_2:Very sad. Too bad he couldn't have gotten into sports as a distraction. agent_1:Speaking of sports, did you know that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's dunk shot was banned from college basketball for over a decade.	agent_2:I did not! I follow shaq closely though and he only had one 3 pointer ever!
55003	agent_2:Yes! Locheed Martin assumed nasa would use the imperial system but unlike the rest of the US they follow the rest of the world and use metric. Most missions to mars actually fail. It's not easy getting there. agent_1:Communication sure is key.  agent_2:It helps that a day on mars is almost the same as here on earth. 	agent_1:Mars sure is similar to Earth, but its differences in atmosphere make sound a tad bit higher there than on the earth
29028	agent_1:My article says that Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is topping the charts.  That's very interesting, I wonder what kind of a sound they have agent_2:Jazz is really just jazz, no matter where you are.  So, Pakistan having a jazz orchestra probably sounds about the same as it would in the U.S.  I do find it interesting that they would be topping any charts, though. agent_1:I'm sure there are cultural differences that make different sounds.  Interesting that Clint Eastwood has scored several films though.  I didn't know he was musically talented	agent_2:I wasn't either.  But, it's really easy to score a film when you direct the film as well.  Million Dollar Baby was good, but I wonder if he would have been selected with a different director.
101062	agent_2:I did not know that but assuming the avg NFL players plays for 2 years, that makes sense. Not as prestigious though... agent_1:Yeah, I can believe that. There's also no written rule against female players.  agent_2:There might not be but I don't know if the American public is ready to see female players get hurt.	agent_1:Yeah, I don't think it would happen. When I was in high school some of the teams had female kickers though.
52907	agent_1:They probably told him it would be the best job in the world, jokes on him though haha. I like using Google a lot as well. agent_2:I use google a lot. google is a dog company. i approve. agent_1:I approve with two thumbs up! They also like goats too and let them be their landscapers haha.	agent_2:do the goats get stock options? if so, sign me up!
102409	agent_2:Neptune is a slow planet, one that is not in a rush to get places. I wouldnt want to visit neptunre,. agent_1:yeah did you know that jupiter storms can be heard on the radio? agent_2:Yeah, i think you can hear solar activity. I wonder if those storms are interesting to listen to.	agent_1:I dont know,  I imagine it to sound like static sounding lol
18205	agent_2:Yes, that's pretty interesting. There were some great players back then and now. Federer has 30 singles Grand Slam finals. That's a lot!  agent_1:Thats amazing.  Tennis games can be way too long though- The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days.  agent_2:And, I think a four or five hour match is long! I can't believe Federer's worst injury came from giving his kids a bath. That sounds like something I would do! 	agent_1:haha right!  This is interesting Roger federer has been gifted two cows over his career for winning the 2003 wimbledon and the 2013 swiss open
93960	agent_1:A bit, they are quite interesting agent_2:Freshwater fish only drink water thru there skin thru osmosis agent_1:What about saltwater fish?	agent_2:Saltwater fish drink thru their mouths!
99609	agent_2:I heard that! You think he would have rigged the game in his favor. agent_1:Or added new rules to favor him haha. I wonder if he had influence for banning the dunk for a decade? agent_2:I heard it was Kareem Abdul Jabbar. He must have just dominated! I feel it is all dunking now ha	agent_1:I agree! Some are nice though haha. Well it was great chatting with you!
56379	agent_2:yea its a compliment battle! a far cry from the regular rap battles we are used to over here in the US.  agent_1:I can't imagine how that would work. I understand the concept but it practice it seems absurd to watch.  agent_2:I think it would be wholesome and fun! nice to see some people be nice to each other for a change. Thats a much nicer rap than that judge that delivered a ruling to Eminem in the form of a rap	agent_1:That is so cringe worthy. Why would she do that? It's embarrassing.
45869	agent_2:i would love to see a showdown between the two teams. it would be good to see lebron against the warriors. agent_1:I agree, can you imagine the NBA finals between both teams? its a hard call but I think the Warriors will win.  agent_2:are they in the same conference? i think that to play each other before the finals.	agent_1:I have no idea I just follow the finals, but I think they do yeah, The Boston Celtics also have a nice team, they did lose Gordon Hayward.
8719	agent_1:I like all music. Did you know jazz originated in the African American communities of New Orleans in the late 19th and early 20 century. agent_2:i think I did know that.  Seems like I've seen a movie that referenced it.  Didn't they combine jazz with some brass band marches or something? agent_1:It has roots in blues and ragtime.  It is now recognized as a major form of musical expression.	agent_2:I'm glad.  It's world wide now too.  Pakistan has a jazz orchestra!
34887	agent_1:That would be interesting. Those 4 million songs make up 20% of all of their songs. agent_2:They need to do something because apple music is catching up to them. They are only 3M subscribers behind. agent_1:That is a close race! Did you know youtube is the second largest search engine?	agent_2:I did not. That makes sense though because they are owned by google, the number 1 search engine. I was surprised to learn the creator is from sweden. No idea.
51198	"agent_2:well he actually got his start after he won a Steve Martin lookalike contest, that was his gateway to fame, very interesting agent_1:Thats hilarious!!! thats as good as way as any to become famous I guess lol agent_2:ya that was very unexpected, also unexpected that someone told Ronald Reagan that he was rejected for a part because he didn't have a ""presidential look"" talk about hilarious haha"	agent_1:That is ironic and really funny lol, I bet he was like I will show them and became a president to shove it in their faces
88498	agent_1:So strange that there is one Canadian team. Do you remember Kareem Abdul-Jabbar? agent_2:Why is it strange? There used to be 2. I do remember him. He got the dunk banned from college basketball now that is strange. agent_1:I just forget that it's the North America league rather than the US league. Yes he did. It's crazy that his dunk was so dominant that that happened. They kept the ban for over a decade. 	agent_2:That kind of ban would never fly now. Especially with so much more money in college basketball. Did you know that in 39 states, the highest paid state employee is actually either a basketball or football coach?
99605	agent_2:for sure lol. I should just watch 5 horror movies per night and call it good! Rock hard abs here I come! agent_1:Haha same here! Do you like basketball at all? agent_2:I love basketball. I like the Kansas Jayhawks.	agent_1:Can you believe the inventor of basketball himself is the only Kansas coach with a losing record.
144153	agent_2:Speaking of women in sports, do you follow tennis or Serena Williams? agent_1:I dont follow tennis, but serena is a legend. Anyway, great chat! agent_2:I didn't realize she can speak French and Italian, but it might just be something international players need to try?  	agent_1:she probably lived in different countries and had a chance to study there. that is great! Have a good evening!
72237	agent_1:Ahah I'm sure it's not really about scorpions though. Are you interested in other celebrities? agent_2:Yes.  The cross overs are interesting like Carol Burnett appearing in Sesame Street.  How about you? agent_1:Wow that's interesting, they all have unique talents for sure. Robin Williams in Aladdin actually started the trend of celebrities as voice actors.	agent_2:That became a money maker for many celebs.  Most are wealthy,  but occasionally you read about one who has gone broke.  Often due to drugs.
18557	agent_1:I remember taking that ride and was sick from it when it shook you all over the place lol. I think I'll let someone else go to mars haha. agent_2:lol, you must of got on the rougher side!! The pressure on your chest in unreal!! agent_1:For sure! Can you believe the sun is only one billionth the size of the biggest star found in our galaxy?	agent_2:That is beyond what I can visualize!! How do you feel when you hear, If the earth entire history was viewed as a 24 hour period, Humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds!!Omg
158957	agent_1:I don't know much about it. I can barely keep up with all the new technology available! Times sure have changed since foxhole radios in World War II! agent_2:I think they might still use those radios in the White House. The WH still uses floppy disks. WTH? agent_1:That's crazy! The have solar panels, but are still using floppy disks? Funny!	agent_2:Solar panels were put on there by Carter. Reagan took them off. I would love to see the old-style elections back in 1805. The runner-up in the presidential election became VP. I love the idea of Trump being paired will Hillary Clinton. Good times!
79238	agent_2:I don't, I think that is just some crazy theories that he still is, how about you? agent_1:I dont think so either agent_2:But, you know how some people will always come up with those crazy theories. 	agent_1:Oh yes, someone always comes up with crazy theories.
126392	agent_2:Summer of 1932. Have you ever heard of Wayne Gretzky agent_1:Yeah, he is still a legend in Canadian Hockey.  agent_2:whats your favorite hockey team?	agent_1:Penguins. How about you?
9812	agent_2:Yeah. The black swallower fish seems legit. And also has a big stomach! agent_1:That must be why it can eat prey twice it's own weight and 10 times it's weight?   agent_2:10 times its weight is crazy! I weigh 245 and cannot imagine eating something that weighs 2450 pounds!	agent_1:LOL  Did you know that the seahorse is the only fish to not have a neck?
137893	agent_1:oh ya me too, he's very business savy, and I like the books that he wrote too agent_2:I did't know he wrote books, I bet those would be an interesting ready.  I often like to read books by successful people to see their process and prospective. agent_1:ya he wrote books and I like the audiobook versions that he does because I like his voice, do you follow basketball at all?	agent_2:I do like listening to audio books when the author narrates.  I don't follow too much basketball, but I do know that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's use of the dunk got the shot banned from the sport in college for over a decade.
14270	agent_1:Speaking of dance, I often find it interesting that persons you typically do not associate with dance are actually very good if not professional dancers.  Like Bruce Lee, the martial arts champion, who won a Honk Kong Cha-Cha championship! agent_2:I could see a martial artist to be good on his feet. agent_1:I could to, but martial arts is much more fluent and unpredictable since you are sparring and do not know your opponents next move.  Dance tends is choreographed and you are with a partner and not an opponent.  But, I guess dance in is our blood.  Babies spontaneous dance when they hear music and smile more when the lock onto the beat!	agent_2:All my kids have loved music. Even as babies they would nod their head when music was playing.
25064	agent_2:Too true.        What do they call that black disc they use in hockey? agent_1:That would be the puc. Not much of a hockey fan, eh? agent_2:I am more familiar with field hockey!	agent_1:I see. I live in a part of the world with a lot of snow, so I'm more used to ice hockey. Canada is a powerhouse in ice hockey. Especially at the Olympics.
115054	agent_2:No, haven't heard of her who is Chelsea Hodson? agent_1:She has written a book, a collections of essay's called Tonight I'm Someone Else agent_2:She seems like a really smart person do you think she likes animals? there are 20 quintillion in the planet so maybe she does 	agent_1:I'm guessing she likes some animals, but not all 20 quintillion of them.
133040	agent_2:Yep, exactly right.  We would have them and the dogs at the house would help train them, a lot of times just puppies.  agent_1:That is very cool.  I like that.  What a wonderful person your roommate is. agent_2:Yeah she was really cool, she must have fostered out around 15 dogs. 	agent_1:I don't suppose then you have time to watch football much do you?
92192	agent_2:I know it all ads up, crazy too that the gov. has shut down 17 times in 37 years, thats kind of a low agent_1:Wow I didn't know it was that many times! I feel the higher ups should not be getting paid if they shut it down agent_2:ya I agree with you, do you ever play the piano? I am teaching myself atm	agent_1:Not since I was a kid, are you any good so far?
118374	agent_2:I don't think so, but I do think that the roads there are in really good shape.  agent_1:They should be.  Did you know Facebook is mostly blue because Zuckerburg has red-green color blindness? agent_2:Yeah I think I have heard why that is why everything is blue. 	agent_1:Yes, as I said, mostly blue.  Thanks for the chat.
63320	agent_2:Intersting, no I haven't really been paying attention. Hungary used to be a really good football team. agent_1:Yes they were. They only lost once between 1950 and 1956 agent_2:More people should watch American Women's soccer!	agent_1:I agree. America has never placed below third place in the world cup since women's world cup started in 1991. Interesting !
74176	agent_2:hey hows it going, did you know the first moonwalk was actually done in 1955, the dance move that is haha agent_1:i didnt, thats crazy I always thought MJ invented that move! Bruce Lee appartently was an avid dancer as well. do you like to dance? agent_2:well I am really bad at dancing actually but I try my best haha, what about you	agent_1:Same pretty much. I like to think I'm great but I must look like a fool. Its fun though. Just like babies, i dance when I hear music
132630	agent_2:true, and that there is 3g cell and internet at the peak of mt everest agent_1:I guess so people can post things on facebook when they do it huh? They probably have to look at the hamburger button for a bit when it's loading up there! agent_2:funny name, 7% of people don't look at terms when buying product on the internet	agent_1:I would have thought that number would be 0 percent because I'm guilty of just scrolling to the bottom and agreeing haha.
99440	agent_2:Yes what would President Banana do?  agent_1:Until 1805, the runner up in the US president's race would automatically become VP. If that rule weere still true, the VP would be Hillary. I am sure the tone in Washington would be so much better if that would be the case. agent_2:I loved that in the past someone from the other party was your VP. Why was that changed I wonder. We might be better off. 	agent_1:Then they could all sing songs together, and release pop albums with their songs of unity, like the President of Indonesia.
96120	agent_1:I like country music,  but I dont follow it enough to know a lot aboutit how about u agent_2:I'm not really a country fan. I was surprised to learn that the stratocaster was design for country music. It really caught on in rock. agent_1:Yeah that is interesting.  I hear U use to open for themselves and dress up in costume.  thats pretty funny 	agent_2:U2 probably got bored with the same old music and wanted to have some fun. I understand the desire for variety. They probably had enough money.
116838	agent_2:haha ya he had the right idea, Jon Hamm also was interesting he was a drama teacher in high school before he hit it big agent_1:There was a kid in my HS named John Hamm.  He had a reading problem.  Speaking of reading, it's hard to believe the spread of people reading novels in the 18th century caused a moral panic.  What were they reading? agent_2:haha ya imagine if people were scared that so many were reading nowadays, I would just laugh haha	agent_1:I think it's the other way around.  We are now fearing illiteracy.  Everything is on the internet like where one can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas.  One has to listen, not read.
76637	agent_2:Yeah, I heard they spend 20 times more on postage than bandwidth.I had forgotten they still have the DVD option. agent_1:I didnt know about their DVD option but I guess the company started out that way,  agent_2:Yeah I remember getting DVDs before the streaming option got good enough. I am surprised they still have the DVD option! 	agent_1:Maybe they will cancel that option soon enough, their first series was Lilyhammer
61960	agent_2:Sure, but not forever. I need info and I have a big family I like to stay connected to. The only downside is that I live in the country and my connection isn't always that great. I just recently learned that number of bars doesn't tend to correlate with connection quality either so my problems are hard to predict. agent_1:That is why I have a landline, I don't have a good reception in my house. But landline phone are so stupid, they don't do as much as an IPhone.  agent_2:Yep! I agree. It's been nice talking to you. I hope you continue to enjoy your library.	agent_1:You too, I will go this evening.
154240	agent_1:Even on the JV team, that's crazy to think. He is the best ever. agent_2:Yeah, you are right! Did he finish college? Alex Smith took so many tests in high school that he entered universeity as a junio and got his bachelor's degree. Then he started working on a master's degree before he was the first overall pick in 2005 NFL draft. agent_1:Yes he did. Smith is one smart cookie! Imagine if Baker Mayfield did that instead of wanting to play video games all day.	agent_2:Yeah, full time competitive gaming can sometimes be lucrative though I doubt as good as football player pay.
1967	agent_2:Its amazing how there are more than 7 million species of animals and there are more to discover. agent_1:There are about 20 quintillion animals on planet earth. agent_2:Wow, that is a lof animals for sure, you know that animals have constitutional rights in Germany?	agent_1:In 1912 Scottish protection of animals act, the loch ness monster is a protected species.
47245	agent_1:True, some people still don't get how big of a problem that is, which is even scarier. Dogs though, they get it. agent_2:I like dogs. I have a couple of them.  Did you know that dogs and elephants are the only animals that instinctively understand pointing? agent_1:Really, would never have guessed that. I love my dog, I don't know what I	agent_2:Google is a dog company...they put it their code of conduct that they are a dog company.  lol
127324	agent_1:It looks goofy but it works. I think Rick Barry used to shoot that way. agent_2:It does look silly which is why NBA players refuse to use. I don't know why they care though if it works.  agent_1:They want to be stylin'. Think of Jordan and his shoes. He wanted to look the part.	agent_2:Speaking of his shoes, did you know they were banned in the NBA when introduced?
95275	agent_2:Yeah, that's it. Footwork. Michael Jackson could've kicked some ass.  agent_1:I bet he could have. the speed, the timing. he had the tools for superior martial artistry. agent_2:Although I hear he relied on a device for one of his moves. Patented it too.	agent_1:That sounds like michael. that would be his shoes for leaning and defying gravity.
21216	agent_1:I had no idea a cat had ever been cloned. agent_2:Hello, that was new information to me as well!  agent_1:Seems a bit odd considering the overpopulation problem we have as it is lol	agent_2:This is true, I wondered if the cat behaved in the same ways as the original.
129221	agent_2:that is weird, definitely not now agent_1:Yeah,  as much as football players get injured they should be getting paid more than bowlers lol  agent_2:true, and what about the british saying sports destroys happiness?	agent_1:what about it?
83143	agent_1:lol Starship Troops is already a movie,  it came out in the 90's it was awesome!  agent_2:What do you like about it?  Is it better than Nintendo and its systems? agent_1:Those are not really comparable because they are so different.  It was a great action movie that was less than 2 hours long,  with aliens and a bit of comedy.  The nintendo is a classic video game system that had like 100's of games made for it and hours of gameplay.  	agent_2:Do you think inequality really makes people live shorter lives and have less healthy lives?
163981	agent_2:I wonder too. Do you know what he highest score in college football is? agent_1:That was 222-0  with Georgia Tech beating Cumberland agent_2:Yeah. Bowlers make more money in the 60s than football players	agent_1:Yes it was not that popular of a sport back in the day
115408	agent_2:Plus soccer requires less equipment. I wonder how the game would work with three teams playing at once agent_1:That would be interesting to watch. I wonder how the newscasters would cover that on the airwaves. Trying to keep three teams in perspective would be rough. agent_2:True, but I guess use of colors maybe. It would still be less confusing that picking up a Jupiter storm on the AM radio	agent_1:Ha. what would that sound like? Pure static. Might be better than listening to classical Latin, if you listened to a Finnish radio station back in 1989.
72935	agent_2:The pitcher is a crafty one. he throws the ball many ways to confound the batter. he cannot be trusted. agent_1:So the pitcher is a crafty player and his position is to confuse the batter? Is this accurate to say? agent_2:yes, that is fair. the batter must react to the pitcher's choice of pitch. it is challenging. but that is the game. there are 60 feet between the pitcher and batter.	agent_1:I didn't know this. Thanks. Now what is the objective of the offensive team?
90389	agent_1:yes, let's talk about the sun. he is gone now, so no worries. i like yellow too. warmer. friendlier. agent_2:Yep... All that's missing is the smile... In 2011, I guess Neptune finally made a lap after being discovered in 1846.  agent_1:Wow, I didn't know Neptune was that slow	agent_2:Yeah, it must be a day for slacker planets and stars... The sun does like to boast that it can produce enough energy in 1 second to meet the needs of the Earth for 500,000 years.
41738	agent_1:yep. I read that too. quite remarkable what the right sources can do. Anyways, It was nice chatting with you. Have a great day. agent_2:You have a fabulous day too!!!!!! agent_1:thanks	agent_2:thank you
61012	agent_2:That's a good question because I bet all you can hear is static haha. Would you ever listen to a radio station that only played news that was red In classical Latin? Apparently that radio station exist in Finland agent_1:I would definitely try it out, it sounds interesting to hear latin as a language agent_2:I actually think Latin sounds pretty interesting. But what I don't think sounds interesting is listening to classical radio dramas, there is a website where you can listen to those online for free, but that doesn't sound interesting to me	agent_1:At least it is free to try it out. It was so nice chatting with you!
54249	agent_1:Well not if it's ballet, professional ballet dancer go through 4 pairs of shoes a week agent_2:That's a ton of shoes. Maybe they could buy more on Alibaba. It's the only place that sells more merchandise than Amazon online. agent_1:I wonder where you can buy the shoes Michael Jackson patented for the extreme lean in his dances	agent_2:Probably on Amazon as well, since they sell just about everything, apparel included.
115511	agent_2:I'm not surprised. Watch him on the Apprentice and in interviews. He's got a temper. I'm surprised he's not one of the top three richest presidents. agent_1:I am as well! The U.S. president's guest house is larger than the actual white house, I'm sure his ego must have taken a hit from that. agent_2:He could rent out the place. Just put up a Trump sign and then it's a hotel. 	agent_1:Oh absolutely, don't give him any ideas haha. To be fair a lot of presidents do seemingly unpresidential things. The president of Indonesia has released 3 pop albums in office.
45296	agent_2:Yeah, he is good. So is Lebron James, but I don't he is better than MJ.  agent_1:Do you know the GOlden State Warriors? agent_2:Yeah, they are a pretty good team out there. Apparently they used to play at the cow palace. 	agent_1:Yeah. Do you know LeBron James?
142599	agent_1:I don't care what they did before they got to office.  Only what they were able to accomplish while in office.  Yes,  there were some bad choices that Reagan made but no one is perfect.  But overall, he was a very successful President.  Besides if acting disqualified a person from being president Hillary would never be president. agent_2:You are very angry at Hillary. That's sad. agent_1:Not angry at all!  You must learn the game and then play it to the best of your ability.  She lost twice. Did you know the first president of Zimbabwe was called president banana	agent_2:Yes, I have read that about the President of Zimbabwe.
45952	agent_2:lol  Surprisingly there is 3g cell service and internet capabilities at the peak of Mt. Everest.  Crazy they can get that there and where I live I have a hard time picking it up sometimes! agent_1:Amazing what technology can do right?  Going back to what we talked about earlier.  Kennedy Center's Hamilton online waiting room had about 2,000 people moving through it every hour!  Wonder what kind of computer what running all of that. agent_2:I have no idea.  I know that at one point the demand on the system had over 70,000 users on it!	agent_1:Man, I don't know about that system.  Seems a bit unfair.  Heard some guy logged in earlier and an hour later he got a random spot in line.  Somewhere between 32,000 and 34,00.  A whole hour just to be placed there!
159586	agent_1:Indeed, they are based on viral videos, but some are based on TV shows like South Park on comedy central,  do you watch that channel ? agent_2:Nah i only watch good shows like Family Guy agent_1:Which is a comedy, since when do you watch Family Guy ? I have watched before it was cancelled. I was sad when it happened. 	agent_2:I watched the first episodes about 5 years ago. very cool.
56773	agent_1:I do. It is only fair that they do also, although my dog doesn't care for orange juice. I try to explain to the dog that 80% of the earth's rain forests are gone, so don't knock the orange juice until you try it, but my dog still doesn't get it... agent_2:Haha such a poor doggo. that is sad that all that Forest is gone, also weird that we will run out of helium by the end of the 21st century, what will all the balloon stores use to fill up the balloons? agent_1:Flatulence, of course. I explained this concept to my dog, but he would not fart in a balloon for me.  In frustration, I exclaimed that if earth's history was one 24-hr day, then human history would only be 1 minute and 17 seconds. My dog responded, then why does it take you over two minites to refill my bowl?	agent_2:Haha you need to create a store that sells dog fart balloons LOL I guarantee you someone would buy them haha. What do you think about the un Ambassador that they have ambassador to extraterrestrials must have a really lonely job lol
103331	agent_2:I can't remember but I would like to find it. I know there is only one agent_1:I stopped watching the show around 2000 I think. agent_2:Do you watch pokemon? There are over 750 episodes	agent_1:I don't have TV. I could stream it online, but somehow it never caught my interest.
71941	agent_1:I love YouTube. Did you know it's the second largest search engine on the internet? agent_2:I did not know that, I would have guessed it would have been Bing or Yahoo. agent_1:I would have thought so too. I saw Netflix and YouTube make up half of the peak internet traffic in North America.	agent_2:That doesn't really surprise me since they offer some of the top video options online. I know I use Netflix a lot.
72499	agent_2:I love to travel. I'm going on a multi-state trip in June to visit family. How about you? agent_1:that is awesome, I am going to Brazil in june, to visit my wife agent_2:That's amazing! How are you getting there? Taking a plane, a bus, something else?	agent_1:I meant to say my wife's family, lol! We are taking a plane then renting a car while there. How are you traveling?
157477	agent_2:I love Andy Dalton and Patrick Mahomes. agent_1:Those are pretty good QBs as well, interesting fact about Brady but his coach didnt like him back in high school agent_2:Did you know Kellan Moore is the only left handed QB in the league right now?	agent_1:No I didn't know about him, is he a good QB?
27209	"agent_2:I do sometimes. Do you have a favorite genre? agent_1:I like pop and rock. Do you like Linkin Park? agent_2:I do like some of their songs. Their first album ""Hybrid Park"" is a favorite. It's the best-selling of this century so far"	agent_1:Yeah it is a great album. And Reel Big Fish lost the rights to their music so they rerecorded their hits
50536	agent_2:I will always find that kind of comedy funny, even though most people do not in these current days. Did you know Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 shows since it was made in 1989? agent_1:No. Whew! That's a lot. Has reality TV decreased C. Central's audience, I wonder? agent_2:I think it probably has, I feel that television has been decreasing in viewers recently.	agent_1:There's a lot of streamed content instead, but I still like the bite of satire. Used to be fun to watch Sat. Night Live when they did send-ups of the current Pres. Remember any?
37441	agent_1:No. I am not a fan. I am more classic rock, country or pop agent_2:Which is you favorite classic rock album ? agent_1:Thats hard to say. Maybe Led Zeppelin 1	agent_2:When was it produced ?
83876	agent_1:I believe that is the same company, a lot of companies have made other items. Nintendo used to make playing cards. agent_2:Oh really.  I didn't know that.  Speaking of Apple, do you like Apple products?  Do you have an Apple phone?   agent_1:I am not an Apple User, I use Samsung	agent_2:They are good too.  I was surprised to learn that an iphone had so much power.  Kind of scary.
12743	agent_2:Thats cool to know. Did you also know that the sun is about 109 times the diameter of earth.  agent_1:Wow that is so much! I know the sun is 1 billionth times smaller than the biggest star in the galaxy, makes me feel really small! agent_2:That is true. So what kind of clothing do you like. 	agent_1:I like nike and all the sporty type, but also i like polos to look clean, you?
109829	agent_2:Im great, are you a religious person?  agent_1:I am. Did you know the tower of babel is probably based on a real building? agent_2:I heard that story growing up, that is so cool, that fact is new to me, where is that building located?	agent_1:Modern day Iraq, surprised a building would last that long, to be honest
107998	agent_1:I play the piano actually haha. I do have a guitar though. I'm just really bad at it. Have you heard of Van Halen? agent_2:Yeah he is a great guitarrist, what about him? agent_1:Well he literally set studio speakers on fire when he played a solo LOL. do you like Queen?	agent_2:He did? it must have been one hell of a solo to do that lol, and yeah I just watched Bohemian Rapsody, sad movie.
83030	agent_2:It was an undertaker who though he was losing business because they were rerouting his calls to others agent_1:Nice. Do you know why the NY area code is 212? agent_2:Hmm no idea. DId you know dolphins can talk through the phone too?	agent_1:Nice, how come? The area code was because it was easy to dial on a rotary phone
97781	agent_2:Personally I am pretty in the middle too. There are certain policies I agree with on both sides. agent_1:Agreed. Also, sorry, I forgot to ask you about your party affliation. Are you looking forward to 2020? agent_2:I usually try to look at the representative rather than just the party affiliation, though if I had to choose, I would say I am more republican	agent_1:Me too. I will say I am not a trump fan though.
86631	agent_1:College does that to some people (also, affiliations have changed over time anyway).  agent_2:Agreed. Plus, when she campaignedd in the south, she adopted a southern accent so she is easily manipulated. agent_1:I think that might be partially intentional too, and people's accepts do change.	agent_2:She also won a grammy for best spoken word album for her book. I had no idea.
91002	agent_1:Yeah we are not perfect but we can regrow ribs and thats a cool fact about our bodies agent_2:I actually broke two ribs a couple years ago.  I find that fact very awesome! agent_1:Did it took 2-3 months for them to get recovered?	agent_2:Yes, it did about 8 weeks. Do you like dogs or cats?  I am a dog person just like Google!  They specifically say they are a dog company!
120070	agent_2:If only they were closer! agent_1:I would die to do that. I must admit it can happen in the future, but not in our lifetime. agent_2:Apparently some people believe that there is only one electron in the universe. I wonder how that works.	agent_1:Probably thinking it is the beginning of the universe, you know, where it all started.
110833	agent_2:That's had to give the sitting President a moment of pause.  Did you know President Carter installed solar panels on the White House only to have them removed by his successor, President Reagan? agent_1:I believe Bush put them back on. If Im not mistaken.  agent_2:You are correct!  Its amazing how petty some differences can be.  It seems that each wants to leave their mark on the White House, or erase someone else's!   Given our engagement in the world, I surprised that no President has been fluent in a foreign language since Franklin D. Roosevelt.  I sometime wonder if negotiations get muddled in translation?	agent_1:Im not sure about that. Did you know that teddy roosevelt banned christmas trees from the white house?
24420	agent_2:That would be good to know. Although you would have to be pretty serious to want to go through with renouncing your citizenship in the first place. So, maybe they went to Monaco. Monaco got rid of income taxes because the casinos pulled in enough revenue agent_1:Im sure the standard of living in Monaco is one of the highest in the world.I wonder what happens to the revenue generated in Las Vegas if the government owns the state. agent_2:Ha! That would be good to know! 	agent_1:Governments can be good for some things.The Norwegian government donated 1 billion to save the amazon rainforest.
94947	agent_2:A lot actually. Do you ever watch SNL? agent_1:I sure do, do you have a favorite skit in there? agent_2:I love the Weekend Update which is also the longest running in there	agent_1:Nice I like that too. Did you ever watch the SImpsons?
49845	"agent_1:True. Sarah Vowell, the voice of Violet Parr in Pixar's ""The Incredibles"", is predominantly a political commentator and bestselling author of historical nonfiction, with few other acting credits to her name. I wonder how much she cost. agent_2:That is a thought, but I bet she doesn't command as much as say an Oprah or Meryl Streep or something.  agent_1:Probably not. What other forms of entertainment do you like? Do you like video games?"	agent_2:I do enjoy video games, I used to play Nintendo as a kid.  How about you?
109033	agent_2:Ooh tough loss, double doink! agent_1:Right! I was shocked to even make the playoffs. Since we lost this years and next years draft pick for Mack, I wanted them to win all the games they could, because I don't care for the Raiders... They don't need a higher draft pick. agent_2:Are you a Brady fan?	agent_1:Im indifferent to him. Most people hate him but I really admire him. He's been doing this for a long time at a high level. YOu gotta admire his greatness. You?
26615	agent_1:Yes, we are very adaptable. We can grow back ribs that have been removed in 2-3 months agent_2:That's pretty awesome, unfortunately we can't synthesize our own Vit C because the gene for this is defective in humans  agent_1:That stinks. Animals and plants can do it!	agent_2:Yep, and did you know more than 80% of earths natural forests have been destroyed?
120887	agent_2:I  thought it was a great show yeah, agent_1:Me too, the UK remake didn't do too hot, only lasted 10 episodes. It was so nice chatting with you, check out the remake if you have time! agent_2:I bet that wasnt a good show, being cancelled after 10 episode can ruin some carreers so thats kind of sad, I hope you have a great day as well, its been good chatting.	agent_1:I agree, lol! Have an amazing weekend!
94654	agent_1:I have not. What is that?  agent_2:It's just a funny comedy, but it's pretty old, but still good. You should also check out some movies with the actor Ryan Stiles, he's pretty funny. Do you know him? agent_1:Is it on Netflix? If it is, I'll try to watch it. I do not know him.	agent_2:I'm not sure, it's possible. did you know that in Africa, people can legally add a flame-thrower to their car to stop carjackings? I couldn't believe that was legal! It's actually kind of funny...
112626	agent_2:ah that is interesting, ya they came from wolves and theyve been around humans so long that they are finely attuned to human emotions agent_1:Ive heard of the term Sister Taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated. Which implies that the first species of the dog is extinct! unbelievable  agent_2:wow thats crazy, I like that Russia has a tomb on the unknown dog, that is nice of them to honor dog research subjects	agent_1:Right! or we can be like Istanbul! did you know they have vending machines that releases food and water for the city's stray dogs in exchange for recycled bottles! That should be implemented in the States. How cool.
25019	agent_1:Yes it was. agent_2:I might have to look up what a waterphone is as well, never heard of it agent_1:I don't know what a waterphone is either, sounds interesting. 	agent_2:Nice talking to you
72530	agent_1:Seems like fox has faced a lot of controversies over the years, isnt the Simpsons one of the most popular shows on fox? they have a weird relationship agent_2:Yes, I think so.  Did you know that 55% of airtime on Fox New is dedicated to pure opinion. MSNBC is about 85% opinion.  agent_1:I did not know that, so do you use the internet much?	agent_2:Yes, I use the internet everyday. It is my lifeline to the outside world rather than watching TV.  The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use Internet protocols (TCP/IP) to link different devices world wide. It is a network of networks.
45505	agent_2:Seems legit. Steph Curry is a beast. He also is a humanitarian. Donated mosquito nets to families in Africa. agent_1:yes, what about The National Basketball Association? agent_2:National Basketball Association has 30 great teams. One of the 4 major professional sports leagues in America.	agent_1:Also The NBA is an active member of USA Basketball (USAB), which is recognized by FIBA (also known as the International Basketball Federation) as the national governing body for basketball in the United States, do you agree?
117115	agent_1:Big Sean was such a good student and ha d high gpa and turned down a scholarship to attend MSU agent_2:That is interesting.  Rap Music is quite different - its origins actually pre-date hip hop culture agent_1:Yeah apparently the word apparently has been used in 16th century	agent_2:That is interesting.  It  can be performed with a beatbox, but I rather prefer it acapalla.
116233	agent_2:Yeah, I use it a lot. I heard the co founder of Reddit has a cat named Karma, awe! agent_1:haha I like that, ya reddit is huge, in just one year they had 150 million submissions and over a billion comments agent_2:Wow! That's insane, I knew Reddit was big but that's huge!	agent_1:ya, it's also interesting that Peter Thiel, Snoop Dogg, and Jared Leto were some of the initial investors
3685	agent_1:Funny you mention it i use to write a little poetry. how about you? agent_2:I used to do a little poetry in high school, learning about allusions, symbolism, and all the other poetry jargon.  agent_1:Wow that's taking me back. Poetry dates back to prehistoric times.	agent_2:Poetry was first written by the Greeks I believe. Perhaps earlier, but I don't think we have any other ancient written works dating prior
30885	agent_1:I believe it. Three women from Korea were huge stars in the USA back in the 60's and were the first k-pop stars. agent_2:That's a great bit of history! I wonder what songs they sang. I don't think I've ever heard them agent_1:Not too sure on that one. Jackie Chan actually manages a k-pop boy band.	agent_2:He really knows media. He probably is a big music fan too.
106236	agent_1:Hey there. Are you a fan of watching TV or more of an Amazon Prime person? agent_2:Oh, I like both. What about you? agent_1:I do, too. I keep my cable for nostalgia purposes. Do you watch the Simpsons?	agent_2:I have some. Do you know about Homer's job history in the first 400 episodes?
69209	agent_1:Yeah and it is supposed to run for 10 000 years, wow  agent_2:Yeah I wonder why though. Did you know they deliver on Sundays now?	agent_1:Yeah all thanks to that contract with USPS
155486	agent_2:I know that the three wealthiest ones are JFK, Washington and Jefferson agent_1:Nice!  The president of Indonesia released 3 pop albums while in office. agent_2:What a guy. Do you know what the first president of Zimbabwe was called?	agent_1:I don't know.  What was he called?
107392	agent_1:Yeah he is a strange character, I think the space race for making money has already begun.  agent_2:I guess if Tesla isn't enough to stop the progression of pollution, we'll all need a new planet to live on agent_1:Yeah that is a very good point.  Did you know that Toyota owns some of Tesla?	agent_2:No, I did not. Is Tesla a publicly traded company?
68896	agent_2:Hello, I do, what about you? agent_1:I have a car, I wish I could equip a flame thrower on it like South Africa can lol agent_2:That would be hilarious. Looks like it's to deter carjacking.	agent_1:For sure, I guess it isn't a problem here but a major problem there. Did you know that the first car was created in 1886 and not 1908 like most people think
113652	agent_2:they have yea. Theres a general assumption that if Disney or Pixar made a movie that year. theyll win the Oscar for animated feature. im not sure that will be the case this year tho....Spiderverse is looking pretty good agent_1:Yeah there has been a lot of hype behind that movie. It's funny how Daniel Day Lewis retired from acting. He was so good especially because of the fact that he won best actor at the oscar 3 times-the only actor to do so. agent_2:yea he won a lot of awards. Its funny that the Oscar ceremony was nominated for Emmys in 2013, i didnt know that was possible	agent_1:Yeah that definitely seems like a conflict of interest lol! I also find it interesting how people you wouldn't expect would be good actors. Like the rapper Eminem who won more oscars than Dicaprio, Depp, Will Smith, George Lucas, and bill murray combined!
49697	agent_1:Yes he is a really good and funny actor agent_2:That is great information! agent_1:Do you like Ronald Reagan?	agent_2:Yes, he was also an actor and was once rejected for a role because an executive did not think he had a presidential look to him. He later turned out to be our President.
144890	agent_1:He was.  He also though was a great dancer too and won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship in 1958! agent_2:Nice, it makes sense, though.  Martial arts and dancing require some of the same skills sets. agent_1:I never thought about it until now.  But, yes you're right they do.	agent_2:It's funny how people can be skilled in more than one area like Bruce.  Take for example, Tupac the famous rapper, I heard he also danced ballet.
71291	agent_2:He experienced gravity a little less than the rest of us. I would probably go through seven pairs of those shoes in a week though. agent_1:Well I dated a ballet dancer in the past actually. She didn't go through four pairs but she did go through pairs of shoes a lot. Also her toes were always messed up agent_2:That is not a pretty sight. Good thing you didn't need to look at her feet too much. Did she do much reading? Reading is good for the feet, I've heard.	agent_1:Haha I didn't know about that. I don't do much reading myself I do like audiobooks though. What about you?
143459	agent_2:I probably would not want to travel by land in Japan...the tolls cost more than $300 traveling across the country. agent_1:That is a lot of money, I would rather take a plane, do you know Iceland doesnt have a public rail system, they usually take flights. agent_2:Interesting. Would you like to live somewhere where motorized vehicles are banned? That is the case on Mackinac Island.	agent_1:I think I would, maybe not forever but Im guessing its a really relaxing place to be at,
19211	agent_1:Venus doesn't have seasons.  I wonder what the temperature is like.  Probably a little warmer than here now! agent_2:Definitely! Pluto is no longer considered a planet. agent_1:I heard that.  Apparently there is a planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph in 2000 F weather.  That sounds dangerous!	agent_2:Yeah, I wouldn't want to visit there!
153368	agent_2:I've never seen Pokemon either. I was in an antique shop the other day, and saw a monochrome t.v. set. I would love to have one, to freak out my kids who have never seen a black and white t.v. agent_1:Pokemon definitely would not read well on a black and white TV because of how colorful it is, so I guess that demonstrates how far the medium has come. agent_2:I do black and white photography, many things look so much better in monochrome, than color. Then again, all television is these days, is a mass medium for advertisement.	agent_1:That's true, as is the internet, unfortunately. Nice chatting!
134474	agent_1:ya I don't know for sure, I think it was about the simpsons making fun of Fox News for being so against Democrats, they were probably mad that they were being portrayed that way, what do you think? agent_2:I'm not sure.  Why would they sue themselves? (Simpsons belong to Fox) agent_1:haha thats a good point, do you ever use the website ign.com? I do all the time, and apparently that is also owned by Fox News	agent_2:I never heard of it.
83738	agent_1:Yes, just like the internet which connects millions of people, there's even cell service and internet capabilities at the peak of mount everest! agent_2:Hopefully students can still learn about Helen on the internet. It carries vast range of information and resources agent_1:Hopefully students find reading as fascinating as we older people once did, when there weren't any electronic devices in the mix. Reading does require continuous practice, development, and refinement, creativity, and critical analysis. I love reading.	agent_2:We could put learning braille to good use! Louis Braille the inventor was just 15 when he came up with the idea
57608	agent_2:Yeah he did not have the presidential look, ironic no? agent_1:Very much so as he came to become a real life president agent_2:Exactly. DO you like baseball?	agent_1:I do actually. Do you know why the managers wear uniforms?
140151	agent_1:I did not, but that is just to much, that is enough for 16 years of episodes agent_2:lol, true. Did you know there is a fold in the brain that makes a difference in fantasy and reality? agent_1:Wow that is great and at the same time deep and not easy to understand. I like to watch fantasy movies and read fantasy books!	agent_2:I do too. The car brand name Cadillac was named after a french explorer.
153695	"agent_2:I have not, as I don't watch the simpsons. I would have liked to seen the one where Daniel Radcliffe was voicing Edward Cullen. agent_1:Yeah, that would have been awesome.  I heard that when South Park aired its final episode the producers received flowers from the Simpsons crew.  That was nice of them to do. agent_2:Its weird how divorce has progressed, as of 2011, 1/3 of all divorces, cite ""facebook"" as part of the reason."	agent_1:I can believe it.  Lol I bet MySpace feels stupid for turning down an offer to buy Facebook in early 2005.
22682	agent_2:Will Spring isn't suppose to officially start until the Vernal Equinox on March 20th but where I live it still cold then agent_1:Yeah, it really depends on the day here. I was driving around yesterday with my Jeep top open. Did you know that hiccups are a holdover from early evolution when early land animals had both gills and lungs? agent_2:I've heard it hasn't something to do with early land animals having both gills and lungs but I've also read that it's a reflex from being a baby too	"agent_1:Yeah, i""m not sure if I really believe that about the evolution aspect. My understanding is things just get out of sync internally."
87314	agent_1:It would be cool to see.  I'm sure they would play well together.  If they both were at the top of their games, hands down they would be awesome.  I tip my cap to him for passing up all that money to go to college. agent_2:Yep that was a brave thing to do. It's shocking that 80% of NFL players go bankrupt after retiring for only two years agent_1:Wow.  I don't know how they can burn through that money.  Ex-NBA player Allen Iverson will never have to worry about that after he signed a lifetime endorsement deal with Reebok.  He gets $800,000 a year until he reaches the age of 55 to where at that time he will receive a lump sum $32 million dollar payment.	agent_2:That's very impressive! he'll never have to worry about money, do you think that NBA games should be on Christmas day? I don't think that the coach stan van Grundy should have been fined for suggesting that
160792	agent_1:How could they be so lucky to get that number?  agent_2:I'm sure there was a bribe in there somewhere. Dolphins can recognize another dolphin when communicating by phone. agent_1:Is that another weird fact?  	agent_2:It is. I like these kinds of trivia. Just like the Actress, Hedy Lamarr helped invent wifi, cellphones and gps
64134	agent_2:It was Isaac Asimov, he was the first one to coin it agent_1:Nice. DId you know that Jackson planned to have a robot of himself built to road the desert in Nevada? agent_2:Wow strange. They have made a robotic arms that people without limbs can control with thoughts	agent_1:That is so awesome. THey can also control robots with rat brains now
141479	agent_1:Yeah they won it for the superimposed yellow line agent_2:Yeah and I am glad they created that because makes game watching easier agent_1:very true indeed. Do you know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is/	agent_2:Yes he is a rb who never fumbled a ball in any game
143096	agent_1:Do you use them for the DVD service they provide? agent_2:Not anymore, but I do watch their hourlong fireplace video from time to time agent_1:I myself am strictly into streaming and I've used Netflix for that since they began to do it in 2007.	agent_2:Yea, they have some good movies, 150 of them have a 100% on Rotten tomatoes
135351	agent_2:I think it would, at least it would show that Democrats and Republicans can work together.  agent_1:Yes I agree, I saw that in the old days the runner up would become the vice president, so we could have had vice president hillary clinton, man that would have caused more drama haha agent_2:That would have been a drama fest for sure. If we were like Guatemala, Hillary wouldn't be able to run because relatives of former presidents can't legally run. Imagine that, no Bush, no Hillary. 	agent_1:haha ya I do like that rule a lot, I would definitely want that implemented here, can you believe there was a panic in the 18th century from all the reading that was going on? Seems very silly and over reacting
101278	"agent_2:He really adjusted well. People noticed him early in high. People bought tix to his high school games. ""Who will be the next LeBron?"" No one. agent_1:I feel like Zion Williamson will give him a run but I do not think he will get to that level. agent_2:It must be tough for Williamson. Everybody expects miracles. He's not a god. Does he have any endorsements yet?"	agent_1:Not yet. He is still at Duke and will not be eligible for that until after the NCAA tournament, if he wants to stay eligible to play in college.
365	agent_2:I heard something but I'm not really following his offspring :) agent_1:I saw that they are using a surrogate and only paying 70k.  I'd want a whole lot more than that! agent_2:ok, yes that's what I read... and somebody needs to explain to me, how using a surrogate really works...	agent_1:Simple explanation:  They take egg from mom, Sperm from dad - put it together and then into another person.
163025	agent_2:that is crazy, do you think Trump would do that? He would probably do a duet with Kanye since theyre friends haha agent_1:Oh geez,  I really hope not!  I don't like Kanye West.  I wonder trump has any musical talent though, I guess its possible.   agent_2:haha ya that's true, do you listen to the radio? I guess Jupiter has radio storms that you can pick up on our AM radio	agent_1:not regularly.  have you heard it before?
46318	agent_1:I guess it is Linkin Park's 'Hybrid Theory', which is a complete surprise to me.  I am not a fan but know who they are.  agent_2:Oh, wonderful, thank you for telling me. I was reading that the country music was called Hillbilly, that is so funny, the only country singer I like is John Denver, RIP. agent_1:Yeah John Denver was great, I could listen to him.  I'm more of a classic country type if I do listen to that genre. 	agent_2:Which one is the classic country type? I like classical music, like Rachmaninov, but I like classic rock too.
161953	agent_1:lol no that definitely sounds dangerous. Did you know the indonesia president maked pop records, can you imagine trump doing that? agent_2:No, he is way to busy for that. lol. How would you like to live in Monaco? agent_1:well I heard they don't have incomem tax so that sounds kind of awesome haha	agent_2:yes, Do you like the idea of listening to the sun's music?
16079	agent_1:maybe we can develop trees that produce helium! that would solve the problem. more forests, more helium. agent_2:yeah that would be good, but I'm not sure how that would work with all of this climate change  agent_1:Yeah, we need more forests. or we could move to another planet. that might be easier. LOL	agent_2:yeah we could move to Venus, it does not tilt so there are no seasons there.
38463	agent_1:I understand that Star Wars holds a Guinness Worldrecords title for the most successful film merchandising franchise. agent_2:I am not at all surprised. Lucas was cunning to figure out that the rights were worth more than Fox suspected. Good for him. now he has billions. agent_1:I know.  Fox did not want to pay an additional 500k directing fee but they let him keep licensing and merchandising rights.	agent_2:Lucas had money from a previous film American Grafitti. He could afford to waive it. Smart man. Anyway, great chat!
96869	agent_1:Yep the other sport is lacrosse. Have you ever watched lacross before? It's pretty boring LOL agent_2:It's certainly no ice hockey. I think it requires endurance though. An average professional hockey player will lose up to 8 pounds in one game. That's quite a lot! agent_1:That is a lot, I should start doing ice hockey to lose weight actually haha. I also didn't know that ice hockey stays underneath the court in a basketball game, that seems really crazy	agent_2:I guess space is at a premium. The arena doesn't feel cold though.
77730	agent_2:What's weird to me is that soccer is called soccer because that was slang for association football. I don't watch soccer but I do think it's weird that Americans are the only ones to call it that. I think the name football makes a lot more sense. What about you? agent_1:Yeah it makes perfect sense so go figure, seems like the word football can take many meanings depending on the country agent_2:Yeah I agree with you. Have you ever watched the FIFA World Cup before? Apparently there have been 21 and its total history	agent_1:Yeah and now I am concerned about the upcoming one since the city does not even exist yet
106667	agent_2:I like the norweigian government who donated a billion to save the rainforest agent_1:That's really sincere of them. agent_2:Yes you can Google it.  Do you use Google?	agent_1:I do, it's my biggest crutch. I remember when it went down in 2013. It took 40% of web traffic with it.
143338	agent_1:I did,  but its not that surprising,  Banana is his last name,  Canaan Banana.  agent_2:Oh interesting, well that makes sense then, what doesn't make sense is that the guest house of the White House is bigger than the White House itself! agent_1:Yeah I am pretty sure that is the first thing I said lol 	agent_2:oh haha sorry I forgot, well I also didn't know that the white house has a twin building in both france and ireland
135810	agent_2:Good, how are you doing?   agent_1:I'm doing well, thank you! Did you know that there were over 750 episodes of Pokemon?! agent_2:That's a lot, I'd say I've seen exactly zero.  I have seen a lot of Thomas the Tank Engine though.	agent_1:I have also seen zero episodes of Pokemon! I never got into that craze. I have seen a lot of Pj Masks haha
163774	agent_1:Is that right?  It seems like much longer. I mean, I know there's a lot of commercials and such but it still seems like the actual plays take a while and are more frequent. agent_2:I played in HS and there was a lot of standing around but that seems like too little time.  Maybe tracking chips in shoulder pads will help keep track of time better? agent_1:Oh yeah, I've heard about that.  They are used to track a players every move on the field.  They are even in the footballs to track it's movements.  Do you think the teams get and use any of the information recorded?	agent_2:Probably... Do you watch basketball?  In 39 of 50 states, the highest paid state employee is a college football or basketball coach.
79911	agent_1:Wow. Planes instead. The first king to travel around the world was the Hawaiian king. Who knew! agent_2:So do you, like music at all? agent_1:I do. Do you like music?	agent_2:I do. I especially miss the old days and trips to the record store.
128377	agent_1:I figure they just need it for selfies or to call for help if it gets too cold?   agent_2:I agree! That's why the telephone is also a great invention! agent_1:How true!  Well, it's been nice chatting with you this morning.  Hope you enjoy the rest of your Friday, friend.	agent_2:Thanks you as well!
99298	agent_1:I loved toy story. I had no idea Steve Jobs was the CEO there, between his apple stints. agent_2:Yeah, that's a great film, he started the company and then sold it to Disney! I had no idea Robin Williams was the voice of Aladdin, because of that film, he was the first actor to start the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films. agent_1:I thought he did a great job as Genie. I am into voice actors for shows so I did know that.	agent_2:Carol Burnett was also the first celebrity to appear on Sesame Street, I wonder if she was a voice actor or actually played herself?
1333	agent_2:I believe it was $7,500, and he just spent 2 hours and a half doing so agent_1:Isnt that crazy?  Some of those lines are so iconic, and he got so little for them.  Shame. agent_2:I agree, it is basically nothing.. Did you know George Luca's wife influenced the star wars movies a lot?	agent_1:Yeah, didnt she receive an editing award too?
154674	agent_1:Yep you're right. I wonder why Trump is not in there unless Perhaps it is because we cannot estimate his wealth? On a different note though, why do you think the guest house is larger than the White House itself, that doesn't seem right agent_2:It probably is because they have a lot of people when visiting heads of government come to negotiate.  Their entourages are probably huge in number. agent_1:Yes that could be true. It also could be true that the president of Indonesia released pop albums while in office haha I wonder how much money he made from those	agent_2:Probably a bundle!  Off to the elections, did you know that since 1900, the taller candidate has won the US presidential election 75% of the time?
48046	agent_2:Guess my fav would be German shepherds. Like protective dogs, and those who work with police to sniff out drugs. agent_1:They are beautiful animals. I have never owned a dog. I'd like to, but it's a serious responsibility. They are not toys. agent_2:Agree. Huskies, with their plush coats and blue eyes, are beautiful animals, too. They're so strong, pulling sleds, and working as a team.	agent_1:They really need to be in cooler climates though. In the summer, you need a kiddie pool full of shaved ice for them.
7370	agent_1:I do not any more. I hit that cap and then switched to spotify where I pay for the premium service. Do you like pandora? agent_2:I too use spotify! I like it better. Did you know that the NFL is legally considered entertainment than a sport like the WWE. agent_1:Really. I had no idea. I wonder why that is?	agent_2:Must be for legal reasons. I was surprised as well. Who knew? I would say the Iphone holds alot of entertainment!!
160575	agent_2:Yep! It was the founder of Detroit! agent_1:Oh, that's cool. I've only been to Detroit once. Well, nice chatting with you! agent_2:I have never been there. IT was so nice chatting with you! Enjoy your day!	agent_1:You probably don't want to now. Well nice chatting!
43518	agent_1:I admire his accomplishments like the MVP awards and gold medals hes gotten. agent_2:Yeah, I understand he recently celebrated his 30,000 career point!  That's quite a feat! agent_1:Yes, I hear he reached 30,000 points along with 7,000 assists and rebounds!	agent_2:Speaking of LeBron, did you know he got a $90 million endorsement offer from Nike?  Can't believe how much NBA players make just from SHOES.
79024	agent_1:The Golden State Warriors play home games in Oracle Arena.  Good for them. agent_2:Very interesting! In 1975 they has to play their finals in the Cow Palace because their stadium had been overbooked. agent_1:Cow palace.  Kind of odd things happen there when the Aliens are in town.  I find it funny that losing game 4 of the NBA finals got the Warriors 12 million. 	agent_2:Good chatting with you!
43280	"agent_1:Yeah and demetri martin wrote one of them with just 224 words agent_2:How many hours did it take him to write that? Or is he naturally talented at poetry? Edgar Allen Poe wrote ""The Raven"" and only got $9, but it probably grew in popularity after he died agent_1:Yeah as it usually happens, sadly. DO you know where the hobbit characters names came from?"	agent_2:Didn't they originate from an Icelandic poem? Leave it to J. R. R. Tolkien to be versed in Icelandic poetry
34425	agent_1:Maybe the pet store or maybe they created a bird habitat for them?  I also didn't know that when birds migrate they don't sleep!  That's insane!  No sleep! agent_2:Hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. What thiefs! agent_1:lol Right!  Those spiders worked hard on their webs!  So unfair!  But you gotta do what you gotta do for your babies! 	agent_2:There are wild birds in australia that can mimic the sound of cameras, car alarms, and chainsaws. Can you imagine being around a bird that makes a chainsaw noise? So creept!
23470	agent_2:Did you know U2 opened for themselves a few times and dressed up in costume so no one would know lol  agent_1:Hahaha yeah like the dalton brothers from gavelstone agent_2:Its been good chatting!	agent_1:Same here.
71198	agent_1:One of my friends loved that show so i would watch it with them sometimes. It's crazy that Hugh lLaurie made $700,000 an episode. that is a crazy amount of money. agent_2:It really is. I watched it but I wouldn't say I was a huge fan of it. It's weird seeing Jon Hamm in a drama when I remember him being on 30 Rock from the sun. He's a funny guy. Have you ever seen that show? agent_1:I have sen it a few times. I never could really get into that show very much. I did see that it was a Golden Globe for best comedy series though. 	agent_2:Great show but it wasn't for everyone as it was kind of weird. Have you ever seen Mad Men? I knew it was a huge hit when it was out, but I have never seen it but I have heard good things about it.
22848	agent_2:Yeah that is a curiosity indeed. I cannot think of a reason though. agent_1:Hmm.... maybe it's worth investigating ;) agent_2:Maybe. I find Iceland's use of Facebook even more interesting. Talk about transparent government.	agent_1:What do You mean by that ?
54107	agent_1:no i have not.  what is it? agent_2:Those three horizontal lines that symbol a menu.  It is on most websites, and it's easier to find it if you are hungry. agent_1:hahaaaaa... thats funny anf makes perfect sense	agent_2:The internet carries a vast range of useful information like that. It also carries a lot of junk too. That is why we like it! LOL
29927	agent_1:Good for him, he managed to do both well I guess. Reggie is a great player but was always under the shadow of his sister agent_2:Wow that must have been rough. Most NBA players file for bankruptcy after they retire, that is pretty sad agent_1:Yeah that sure is. The woman went on to break 8 national records. I guess talent runs in that family	agent_2:Nice one. There was a coach who was fined just because he said there should not be any games played during Christmas
104530	agent_2:I don't know I don't really get involved with politics, but I do know the top 3 richest presidents and apparently Trump isn't one of them which is surprising agent_1:No, it's JFK, Washington and Jefferson, I am sure about JFK, but wondering about Washington and Jefferson. agent_2:ya I was thinking that the list must be adjusted for inflation, also weird that the white house is smaller than its guest house	agent_1:True, do you have any Idea where the guest house located?
135850	agent_1:Yes, I too recently read an article on this topic. I wonder why I never considered other animals having blood transfusions. Do you think other animals can do so as well or are we and dogs unique? agent_2:I am sure that others can.  I doubt that it happens too often.  Probably zoo animals who have the best care.  It is something that dogs can thrive on a starch rich diet, yet cats need mostly meat. agent_1:Perhaps it only only for animals human care enough about to do the research and put the effort into keeping alive like cat and dogs or endangered animals. Personally I found it most interesting that Istanbul has a vending machine that dispenses food for strays in exchange for recycling. 	"agent_2:That would ""kill two birds with one stone"".  Debris gets picked up and dogs get fed.  How about Google putting in their code of conduct that they are a dog company?  Weird to me."
85965	agent_1:Did you know soldiers in WWII made radios using razorblades and pencils? agent_2:No I didn't know that! How did they do it? agent_1:Not really sure, but I think they used the pencil and razorblade as the diode. 	agent_2:That's pretty impressive and creative!  Speaking of creative, there's a website where you can listen to old radio dramas for free.  Those were always creative back in the day.
161177	agent_2:It is, but when you break it down, the engineer can work a lot longer than the athletes, thus has more years of earning potential.  There is one rocket scientist coach in the NFL, his college fight song was crazy, including 6 digits of Pi. agent_1:thats pretty cool. did you hear about how the Huddle was invented? agent_2:Wasn't it due to a deaf quarterback not wanting the opposing team to be able to read his hand signals?	agent_1:Yep you're 100% right. The quarterback's name was Paul D Hubbard. I always wondered how you could have a deaf quarterback, but he must have been pretty good because he invented such an iconic thing
25618	agent_1:yeah I think predicted at 15-20 years it will be gone,  thats so weird.  Did you know that the movie titanic cost more than the actual boat? agent_2:I didnt know that, it must had been a really expensive movie to make, specially back in the day when budgets werent so big for movies, agent_1:Yeah.  Have you seen black panther?	agent_2:I have, I though it was a great movie as well, the leading character nailed the role, he was pretty good
103549	agent_2:I watch an average amount agent_1:Are you a fan of The Simpsons? agent_2:Not really, I have never really watched them before.	agent_1:I am sure you are familiar with Bart Simpson. As long as that show has been on there is only one episode where he does not appear and is not mentioned. That's shocking.
10943	agent_2:Popcorn.  She kept jumping when she saw us for the first time at the rescue center. agent_1:awww that is so cute! What kind of dog is it. agent_2:Australian shepherd.	agent_1:I love those dogs, my brother has one, his name is Rogue. Amazing animals. Pets are great, I used to have a rat terrier named Rocky
17187	agent_2:I like concerts as well, been to more pop groups.  I also like going to summer concert series, kind of like a town hall meet up with a band in the summer agent_1:Sure, and better outside sometimes too. I forgot that I went to a festival near where I live for an outdoor flyleaf concert too. agent_2:Yes.  Do you like politics?	agent_1:Sure. Do you get involved?
126224	agent_1:if they cant pass the tests then they dont deserve a degree,  agent_2:The schools can provide tutors. agent_1:not the schools place to reach out for the student to get help, if i needed help i had to ask for it myself not the school hand it to me	agent_2:The schools get a benefit from the athletes. Shouldn't the schools owe something to them for their services? Doesn't have to be money.
17669	"agent_2:No kidding! May even find some old Edgar Allan Poe literature. Speaking of Poe, did you know he only got  $9 for the publication of ""The Raven""? That is truly unbelievable! agent_1:Oh, so sad, and how famous  is his poetry today! did you know poetry is so old, It can be found in Pyramide texts dating back to the 25th century BCE? agent_2:That is amazing! I wasn't aware of that! I also think those poems are amazing that when read normally are depressing, but backwards are inspiring and motivational!"	agent_1:Wow I have to try that! And also reading the javanese alphabet which forms a poem too!
135816	agent_2:That's why I watch all that Thomas, the kids.  I probably see more videos on the internet, such as with Youtube. agent_1:Same here. I'm mostly on the internet for entertainment purposes, such as facebook! There's just so much advertiments on both.  agent_2:I hear all that clicking can be addictive, measurable in fact.	agent_1:Oh yes, for sure! I also had no idea that Alec Baldwin narrated The Tank Engine. I love him!
99378	agent_2:Wow, I wonder how many plays it took for the band that had a silent album on spotify to ear 20,000 dollars agent_1:lol right.  Thats pretty impressive! agent_2:Yea, I wonder if artists get any of the money spotify gets from their paid subscriptions 	agent_1:Good question,  I hope so!  Its been great chatting!
117279	agent_2:There is little wrong with that.  It would seem that the wine trade is important.  It promotes cross cultural ism. Enjoy different wines, like horses. agent_1:Yeah, he says that wine lovers have a generous spirit and have an international outlook, celebrating differences. agent_2:Trade will do that to you.  So will drinking wine.  Do both at once and you will meet lots of new people, cultures. 	agent_1:Right, like differences from vintage, place of origin, grape variety.
55329	agent_2:I haven't.  I am not that into most video games, mostly mario brothers is my jam. agent_1:ya I liked playing mario on my nes back in the day, can't believe that system was around until 2003 agent_2:They recently relaunched it in digital form.	agent_1:oh wow I shoudl check it out, does it still only support 54 colors?
68470	agent_1:Probably helps if you're stoned, LOL. I'm surprised the earth's day was so short at first. I wonder if the moon's gravity slowed it down. agent_2:Yeah I think it did. I heard you can fit all the planets between earth and the moon and still have room left over.  agent_1:I'm afraid they'd all be one big planet before long though. We really need to reverse deforestation. I recently read where reforestation and rewilding could suck decades worth of CO2 out of the atmosphere.	agent_2:Yeah, that's pretty scary to think about.  Hopefully something will be done to reverse it.
148159	agent_1:I loved that show!  It was one of my favorites.  I heard he made like $700,000 per episode. agent_2:That's some nice cashola.  I think I could live a lifetime off of one episode's worth of wages.  Jim Carrey doesn't make dramas any longer because it's against his believe system that prevents him from playing role that don't project positivity.  I kind of like that.  We need more positivity in the world. agent_1:We really do, the social climate has become so negative.  	agent_2:Yes.  I don't like it.  Did you ever listen to radio dramas?  I never did.
83059	agent_1:Well I can't believe it. He came a long way. Reading is so important. It requires continuous practice, development, and refinement. agent_2:Plus, it is fun.  Everyone reads in a different way and different things. agent_1:No doubt about that. What's even better is there are no concrete laws in reading but it just provides the reader an escape!	agent_2:Talk about the ultimate form of entertainment.  Of course sometimes it is fun to do other stuff like go to Chuck E cheese
1762	agent_1:I think around 2015 agent_2:Thanks. The main component of tennis is racket until 1978 a tennis player was allowed to use absolutely any object as racket. agent_1:Thats interesting!  	agent_2:Google was founded in 1998. It is an American multinational technology company that is specialized in internet-related services.
11674	agent_2:That is still quite a while for regular business trips. And in economy class? Forget about it. agent_1:I agree. Only the lichens and cyanobateria would be able to thrive on Mars anyway. agent_2:I guess we could put atmosphere converters there and give it a few decades to shift to oxygen. Maybe it would be habitable.	agent_1:Depends on a lot of factors.  Did you know that a satellite was lost on Mars because Locheed Martin used the imperial system while NASA used the metric system.
83258	agent_1:Hmm nope I do not know that. Was it a really famous senator? agent_2:It was Senator Strom Thurmond. He spoke for 24 hours and then some, non-stop agent_1:Are you serious? What? Did you know women were not allowed to wear pants there until 1993?	agent_2:I did not know that. How did the change come about?
127294	agent_1:hi, do you like basketball? agent_2:Yo dawg! What up? I do like me some of them hoops yo. agent_1:do you know who kareem abdul-jabbar is?	agent_2:I have heard the dude's name. He changed it when he went Muslim, I think.
22824	agent_2:Wow, you know a lot more about fish than I do, have you seen through the barreleye fish's transparent head? Does it not have a brain at all? agent_1:Some fish are basically just nervous systems. It is so interesting. It is odd that 84 percent of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in zebrafish. agent_2:Wow, I wonder if they're used in medical research. That an astounding number compared to different species. Are you a Facebook user at all, I think I'm the only human not on Facebook, my wife loves it. Did you know one third of divorce filings mention 'Facebook', that isn't good.	agent_1:Oh that is terrible. I have an account but rarely use it. I do remember when it first came out and was just used for higher education institutions and Ivy league schools.
155400	agent_1:The radio is certainly a well-established tech. I wonder if Trump is tuned in to stations that others can't hear. Trump is not one of the top three wealthiest presidents in US history. I wonder how he feels about that. Maybe he'll cook the books so that he can claim top slot! LOL.  agent_2:No doubt about that and I totally agree with your take on Trump. How far we've come since the times of Lincoln! Did you know he was the first president to be Photographed for his inauguration? and John Wilkes was in that photo agent_1:JW Booth understood foreshadowing. He was setting up the drama for resolution and closure in the third act. Until 1805, the runner up in a presidential election became the VP. I think there is comedy gold to mine in that setup. Imagine Clinton and Trump battling it out in the Cabinet meetings every morning. 	agent_2:Haha, That sounds like a reality show! haha anything to make money. He even made a book over a hundred years ago... LOL have you heard of Barrons Trumps Underground adventures? It's fascinating and mind boggling at this time in our world.
110709	agent_2:The usoc director says they are not where they want to be quite yet. agent_1:in your opinion, the game will be better or worse in term of competition and peaceful purpose of the game agent_2:I think with all the negativity in the world. The Olympics is what brings us together. Do you like hockey?	agent_1:I have only watched a handful of games.  But I like other sports like football, basketball, tennis.  You?
111214	"agent_2:Did you ever watch House starring Hugh Laurie?  He earned $700,000 per episode making him the highest paid actor ever for a tv drama. agent_1:Yes. I watched only some episode. I have no time to watch it. The drama comes from the Greek word ""action'. The drama represent the traditional division between comedy and tragedy. agent_2:Did you know that Michael Caine became an actor?"	agent_1:Jon hamm taught drama at his old high school. One of his students was ellie kemper. Do you know ?
35963	agent_2:Nice. USA olympic team lost to a high school team once agent_1:Really, what was the score there, was it too bad? agent_2:They lost 6-3, so yeah pretty bad	agent_1:Wow. Did you know Canada has two national sports?
35179	agent_2:Yes I mentioned that earlier. agent_1:oh sorry lol So what cars are your favorite? agent_2:That's okay. As I said I really want a Tesla, but for now I've got a cadillac. Cadillac is named after the founder of detroit.	agent_1:Nice, it was nice to chat to you about cars, though being female I adore cars lol
91190	agent_2:He likes his mysteries. Everything about him sounds fishy. agent_1:Yes it does. A funny fact is that he was voted most sexiest man alive by the onion and China totally believes it ha ha! agent_2:Yeah, they do not seem to get sarcasm there. It just goes right over their heads. 	agent_1:Yeah pretty funny. Apparently North Korea has theme parks but they're undergoing renovation of course at the orders of Kim Jong-un.
66333	agent_1:Hey do you ever watch the World Series? Apparently viewership has been declining over the years agent_2:I do watch it.  I'm a baseball fan.  The sport has been declining in popularity for years now.  So that doesn't suprise me. agent_1:Speaking of games and sports, what do you think about baseball? I personally think it's incredibly boring	agent_2:I like it because I played it.  I understand though why people find it boring.  They love it in Japan and a lot of Japanese fans are surprised to discover it's status as America's national pastime.
113439	agent_2:Yeah. Do you ever watch the SImpsons? agent_1:I used to when I was younger, not so much now. Well, nice chatting with you! agent_2:Same here, and have a great one	agent_1:You too!
128652	"agent_2:Thats cool. Animals, like humans, have a dominant ""paw"" or side agent_1:Do you think animals will understand humans? agent_2:Depends on how you communicate I guess. Animals from geographically distant areas often speak different ""languages"" or ""dialects."""	agent_1:That's nice. Do you like to see television?
128547	agent_1:it makes me happy to know that those actors lent their talents to that show, so beloved by children everywhere. Anyway, great chat! agent_2:Yeah, it's been great! Thank you! Have a wonderful day! agent_1:You too. Have a good day!	agent_2:Goodbye! :)
35091	agent_1:He is a great innovator. he takes on projects that other big companies shun, like the electric car. agent_2:True, he also founded paypal, space X and Tesla! agent_1:He is a serial entrepreneur. i wonder if he will ever get to mars.	agent_2:I dont know.  I think if anyone can, it is definitely him.
81411	"agent_1:I sure am, I read quite a bit. Do you know there is a woman that holds the world record for fast reading? agent_2:Yes, 4700 words per minute! I don't know how many I can read in a minute but it is nothing close to that! I heard recently that in the 18th century there was actually a ""moral panic"" because of the widespread reading of novels. Hilarious! agent_1:It is hilarious considering now we have the opposite crisis, where people are not reading enough. So strange"	agent_2:That's so true. I love to read. Recently I have been doing a lot of reading about the ancient Olympians. Did you know that Aristotle spoke with a lisp?
143861	agent_2:Yea, I have it on my Nintendo. Did you know Nintendo was founded in 1889 as a playing card company? agent_1:No I didn't know that. I do like playing Nintendo myself though, did you know that they also created knockoff Legos? agent_2:Lol, no, I just thought they created video games. I wonder how much those playing cards they made are worth now	agent_1:Yeah I think they are worth a lot of money. Did you ever play the Nintendo 64? There was a video game for it called f0x and it was the first racing game to run at 60 frames per second
138242	agent_2:I watched Mad Men. that was good. i havent seen House. is it good? agent_1:It was pretty good.  It made Hugh Laurie the highest paid actor of all time.  He earned $700,000 per episode.  Mad Men was such a good show.  I wish they could have stretched it out for a few more seasons. agent_2:I think they were running out of ideas for Mad Men. Many shows just peter out. I should check out House. Anyway, great chat!	agent_1:I loved Joh Hamm's character on that show.  He also taught drama at his old high school.  I didn't know that.  Yes...I had a great time chatting with you too!  Have a good night!
106552	agent_2:W Bush ended up reinstalling Solar Panels on the whites house, surprised Al Gore didn't make Clinton do it agent_1:Yes!  You have a good point there!  It took the secret service 4 days to realize that bullets had struck the white house on Nov. 11, 2011.  Kind of scary to know they didn't catch that right when it happend. agent_2:Yea hopefully those Secret Service agents were fired after the bullets were found	agent_1:Good thing!  Do you listen to Pandora Radio?
75643	agent_1:good morning to you! agent_2:To you as well!  Are you a fan of Jazz? agent_1:its okay! i like to listen to it when i cook or eat dinner on a hot date. what about you?	agent_2:I enjoy it too!  I think it is neat that Clint Eastwood is a huge Jazz fan and even plays piano!
136427	agent_2:I'm actually surprised by Jefferson being on that list, he wasn't very wealthy when he died. Actually, it's kind of interesting that until 1805, the vice president was the runner up in the presidential election. That would be crazy today!  agent_1:I think Trump and Clinton would have killed each other by now lol, but I think its a great idea, a way to unite parties agent_2:It probably would help. Most presidents are sports enthusiasts right?	agent_1:Whatever wins votes I guess, the president of Indonesia is a pop fan, he actually released 3 albums
130664	agent_1:Yeah... them too!  LOL  I wonder if Trump is up in the top wealthiest presidents with Washington, Jefferson and Kennedy? agent_2:I would imagine he is, with all the backlash against his tax returns agent_1:Well.. it is the government!	agent_2:that is for sure, they apparently own 86% of the land in Nevada, that is crazy to me
73318	agent_2:I think I have! I remember internet addiction was actually a topic in my psychology class. One of the projects was to go with out the internet for a weekend and I don't think anyone actually completed it!	agent_1:Yeah, I can see where that'd be tough.  The Internet is so ubiquitous nowadays they even have internet capabilities at the peak of Mt Everest.
21679	agent_2:How fun, I wish I could compete with them, I bet I would lose like in the first round lol agent_1:haha ya although my poetry is pretty bad they would probably laugh at me, did you know the YMCA invented volleyball, basketball and softball? agent_2:No, I did not know that, although I am a fan of softball, do you play any of those sports?	agent_1:I am really good at volleyball, I like playing that at the beach and in my backyard, not so much the other two, what about yoU?
96482	"agent_1:No, i did not. is he famous? agent_2:Yes and no. Had a 2015 hit, but it never went to #1, so his Nashville record company ditched him. Went to to perform at Grand Ole Opry, where he sang ""Five More Minutes (about losing grandpa). It racked up millions of views. Has had Top 10 singles. Co-writing songs now. Is that famous, would you say? agent_1:that is famous. he has got what it takes to make it. he will soon be back on top."	agent_2:I hope so. Won Idol at age16. Only 24 now. Do you have a favorite artist or group?
102979	agent_2:Lol who knows, politics is crazy, there has been 5 US presidents elected who have lost the popular vote agent_1:That is crazy! Almost as crazy as knowing the runner up in presidential elections became the vice president up until 1805. Can you imagine if it was like that today? There'd be sheer chaos! agent_2:Well in Guatemala close relatives of former presidents can't run for president, maybe the US could look into that	agent_1:That would be great. And speaking of foreign presidents, the Indonesian president has actually released not one, or two, but three pop albums while serving as president. Ha! I don't know how to feel about that!
60487	agent_2:Yes, the thing it is responsible for all life on Earth is just a small piece of the Universe. Apparently it makes up 99.86% of the total mass of our Solar System agent_1:Some of the facts my kid dropped on me about the sun was eye opening, including the creation of time - days, years, etc.  Why we think the sun is yellow.  I hope she gets an A! agent_2:Sure sounds like he will. Good luck to him! Do you think we will ever get to Mars and colonize it? The sun doesn't keep them quite as warm.	agent_1:I wonder why we can't colonize the Moon first - before going all the way to Mars, essentially a one way trip.  Wouldn't the Moon be a great test run and better than the ISS orbiting the Earth?
49303	agent_2:I guess Nintendo is a bit dated now.  I remember the days when Space Invaders was the height of video gaming.  I don't think it even had ten colors. agent_1:LOL - I think that was a little before my time. I started out with a Nintendo. agent_2:Whatever gamin system you use it sure beats using chickens for entertainment like the Brits did in the time of Caesar	agent_1:It was great talking to you!
157550	agent_1:I completely agree.  After the Civil Rights act and the Voting Rights Act they started shifting right and very conservative.  Taking away voting rights seems to be their big thing right now. agent_2:Yeah, they are not the party of Lincoln like they claim.  Although, Richard Nixon did propose a guaranteed minimum income.   agent_1:Yes for sure.  I find it funny that Harry Truman visited Disneyland and refused to be photographed on the Dumbo ride because he did not want to be associated with the Republicans!	agent_2:That is really funny!  Lincoln was the first president to be photographed and john wilkes booth was in the photo...wow!
125950	"agent_2:I do not think I would want to be a president known as president banana! agent_1:Haha, indeed, I grew up near St. Louis and didn't realize a neighboring community, Collinsville, IL had a law prohibiting ""saggy pants"", given my bad fashion in high school I might have broken that law there. agent_2:That is funny! I grew up in Southern California so we would have had the same problems if that were a law where I live. "	agent_1:I didn't realize the Romans thought only barbarians wore pants, yet as time moved on they were better for mounted armies on horses so pants replaced toga's. If you from Southern California you might have preferred toga's, darn horse soldiers. Did you know pants are underwear in UK vs lowerware here. Kind of like fries and chips UK vs. here.
99729	agent_1:Yeah that is true, it for is a chance on a player.  Did you know that Reggie Miller's sister played pro as well? agent_2:She played pro? Did she get any endorsement? I didn't know that Reggie had a sister. agent_1:Yeah she was really good as well.  I know she scored like 105 points in a high school game once!	agent_2:Wow. What a talent! She should get an endorsement. She must be just as good as her brother.
49867	agent_2:I've seen Monty Python before, but didn't think it was too funny.  agent_1:Yeah I was thinking about watching it. I love Jack Black-Nacho Libre was hilarious. I think he would have been great in The Green Lantern! agent_2:I would have loved to watch The Green Lantern with Jack Black. I bet it would be hilarious!	agent_1:So funny I'm sure. He was great in Jumanji as well lol. Have you ever been to Washington DC. Lots to do there it looks like.
809	agent_2:That's crazy! Precisely why I'm not an astronaut! I wouldn't want to do crazy things such as trust my life to 1mb of ram!  agent_1:Haha! There's a good science fiction  book, The Martian, which has some interestin parts about computers and space shuttles. That author had a pretty good imagination.  agent_2:Woah! In the 50's a judge tried to ban a sci-fi comic because it featured a black character! Thank goodness, we've come a long way from that hatefulness. But still we have a ways to go, before things are truly equal, really for all races.	agent_1:Thank goodness, indeed. I agree with you, though, there is still progress to be made, and I think reading diverse fiction and poetry can help people see things from other perspectives.
99000	agent_2:Cool.  I often prefer streaming tv like Netflix to network TV.  But I do like to watch some of the news on TV agent_1:Yeah, I've been wanting to subscribe to Netflix, but I'm a bit strapped for cash right now, so I just stick to regular cable... Speaking of the Simpsons, did you know there's only ONE ep where Bart doesn't not appear and isn't mentioned?  	agent_2:I think I have heard about that.  On another topic, have you ever seen a lunar eclipse?
73278	agent_2:More than i care to mention. I think it was originally called The Facebook agent_1:Yeah. Harvard used to have something called a facebook, with all the pix of students for a class year in it. Can you believe that Myspace turned down an offer to buy FB for $75 million? agent_2:And look at them now. as of February 2012 FB is worth 104 billion. wow im in the wrong business 	agent_1:Some people seem opposed to FB. Burger King had a promotion where  you get a free whopper for unfriending people.
95756	agent_1:Nice, hope the trunks aren't made of wood in South Africa, they can mount flame throwers on their car agent_2:scary.  There was a race car driver who became professional by beating 90,000 people in a video game gran turismo agent_1:It's funny how far we've come since the car was invented in 1886	agent_2:True.  Who would have imagined dvd players in cars?  I guess reading has advanced creativity
50257	agent_1:I didn't play it much. I had friends that played through Mario. They loved it! I would say that modern systems are more powerful, but the games are not necessarily more entertaining. agent_2:Yep I agree with you there. I'm just glad we live in modern times. We don't have to do what people did two thousand years ago and use chickens for our entertainment LOL agent_1:Chickens? What were the Brits thinking? They are for eating! Do you think Reagan looks presidential?	agent_2:Well apparently he did not look that way at the time, or that's what someone said to him anyway, obviously we know how that turned out LOL do you like Bill Nye the Science Guy?
68513	agent_1:Yeah I think I will as well that is just too funny.  Did you ever listen to Tupac? agent_2:I have heard some songs, what do you think I should listen to? agent_1:I would start anywhere to be honest.  All eyez on me is good.  I guess his music is in the library of congress. 	agent_2:ok great I'll check those out, do you listen to anything besides hip hop?
114171	"agent_2:I usually follow the league around playoff times. The best approach to shooting free throws is the ""granny style"" according to physicists. It is not pretty, though. agent_1:No, it's not. Almost as ugly as the Wizards season! agent_2:I hear ya. The players still get paid well, though. By averagy salary, NBA players are the world's best paid athletes."	agent_1:Tim Duncan stayed in college and lost millions in NBA money.
28852	agent_1:That's true, and not the only way this story makes me question my faith in the institution. I suppose I'd just assumed we had more of a right to know what's going on behind the doors of the systems we the people fund. agent_2:Government transparency is a laughable concept at this point. Always has been, but I think now people have more means to voice their frustrations and find platforms to draw attention to obstruction. What do you think about the fact that the FBI wouldn't identify the marshal? Right thing to do? agent_1:If Angilau's actions were solely on his own part, it may have been alright to release the identity, but so long as it was legal, I understand the necessity to protect the Marshal from the retaliation of Angilau's gang. Even then, that should probably become public record at some point.	agent_2:I completely agree. I think there are probably multiple special considerations to be made when dealing with anything to do with gangs. For example, both Angilau and the witness should have been shackled, and each with at least one marshal close by. The family says there were multiple layers of security in the courtroom, but we don't really know what that means.
49808	agent_1:Yeah I think he just wanted people who didn't care about keeping the job so they would be more willing to do what he asks regardless of consequences. agent_2:You're probably right.  He's had a lot of control over the movie. He not only directed but also wrote it. agent_1:Yeah and all the events of the incredibles 2 are set in the 1960s.	agent_2:That makes sense. The story is all about family life and trying to restore public trust in superheroes.
163739	agent_2:So how do you feel about Kim Jong Un? agent_1:Not a fan lol I think its funny that no one knows how old he actually is.  agent_2:If I had to venture a guess I would say early thirties, but that's just a guess and he isn't telling lol, he claims to have learned to drive at age 3.	agent_1:Yeah it says he was born in 1983,  but Korea has a different way of aging people.  So when you are born in Korea,  you are already one year old,  and the first year you have a korean new years,  you are 2 years old lol
3350	agent_2:Cool!  Russia has a tomb of the unknown dog as a memorial for canine research subjects.  Kind of sad. agent_1:It really is. I just love dogs haha. Did you know in Hawaii the office attire of choice is the aloha shirt? Talk about comfy! agent_2:Nice!  Sign me up!  lol  At Billy Mays funeral the pallbearers wore blue shorts and khaki pants.  Kind of casual and different.	agent_1:RIP Billy Mays! I like how polo shirts were originally invited for tennis players.
82661	agent_1:Yes and that is how that trend of them doing voices got started agent_2:Yeah. Did you know LeBron is the highest paid celebrity agent_1:Yes he makes more than Jude Judy and the woman makes millions	agent_2:Yes she makes $123 000 per episode, imagine that
87148	agent_1:That is very expensive to see high school basketball. Would you pay that? agent_2:I would never pay that in a million years!  Even for a pro game.  lol agent_1:Yes that is too much. Have you heard about Lebron's reebok offer?	agent_2:Was that the one he rejected the $10 million offer from Reebok when he was 18?  Did he end up getting a better deal?  It's been so long I can't remember.
153366	agent_2:Probably the same way they do add programs, or an app. That is interesting. I love That 70's show, and was surprised to find out there is a version in the UK. agent_1:I never got into it; it doesn't surprise me that the UK version only lasted 10 episodes, probably due to the cultural differences. That's nothing compared to a show like Pokemon, of which there are 750 episodes and just gets redubbed. agent_2:I've never seen Pokemon either. I was in an antique shop the other day, and saw a monochrome t.v. set. I would love to have one, to freak out my kids who have never seen a black and white t.v.	agent_1:Pokemon definitely would not read well on a black and white TV because of how colorful it is, so I guess that demonstrates how far the medium has come.
30615	agent_1:oh ya he was good, I don't know if he wont a cha cha championshi[p though like bruce lee did agent_2:No, I don't think so. I think he may have actually won something for ballet, though, but probably as a child. agent_1:ya i'm not sure, but it is shocking that a ballet dancer can go through 4 pairs of shoes a week, thats a lot of shoes!	agent_2:Wow, that's a lot of shoes. It must be very expensive to dance ballet. Their clothing must be very expensive and well made, too.
122577	agent_1:Yeah, do you know what the first president of Zimbabwe is called? agent_2:Yes he was called President Banana agent_1:Yeah Did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house?	agent_2:I guess they get a lot of people there during the year
135399	Did you know Ronald Reagan once got turned down for a role because he didn't have a presidential look?  How ironic. lol	agent_1:I bet that casting agent was embarrassd his entire presidency.
110112	agent_2:Well, that certainly is one way to put it. Sometimes I think that I don't want a republican OR democrat to be president, but that hasn't happened since 1853. agent_1:It costs too much money to run a campaign. Only billionnaires can afford to run as independents. I think that maybe the rules need to change so that money is not so powerful agent_2:That's a good idea. Maybe YOU should run for president.	agent_1:Maybe I should, but I do not have the billion handy right at the moment. It's tied up in a bunch of investments.
126128	agent_2:That's one of the few ways I think a celebrity chef can actually do good, since it is true that if people were more open to alternative, more sustainable sources of food, like insects and algae, there'd be more for everyone to eat. That's a step above beyond just wanting to be famous. agent_1:Yes it is, was more appreciated by everyone. Speaking of celebrities do you know Judge Judy? agent_2:Oh, I love Judge Judy! Not only does she make a ton of money, but she actually works very little because it's such an easy show to produce. Definitely easier to make than something like Sesame street.	agent_1:Exactly. Did you know Carol NBurnett was the first celebrity to apper in the show
85675	agent_2:Interesting I did not know that.  I did learn that baseball managers wear uniforms because they are actually allowed to play if they are needed. agent_1:I can't imagine any of today's managers playing. But perhaps in the past, one of the players acted as a manager. agent_2:Did you play kickball as a kid?  Apparently it is called soccer-baseball in Canada.	agent_1:Yeah, I played kickball. It didn't require much equipment so we could play any time.
5066	agent_1:Not sure who that is, but I wonder if Hawkings would validate the tidbit that the universe could have come from nothing without violating physics? agent_2:I'm not sure that is an interesting thought and he is the leader of North Korea.  agent_1:Oh wow!  Robin Williams in aladdin was the first actor to start the trend of celebrity voicings of animated film characters.	agent_2:I didn't know that.  I guess Pixas spent 3 years studying the physics of curly hair in order to get merida's hair in brave right.
116898	agent_1:Speaking of the Roosevelts, Teddy banned christmas trees from the white house! agent_2:the white house apparently sends back congrats cards for birth announcements! agent_1:...but it took them four days to realize that someone had shot up the place back in november of 2011!	agent_2:really? I never heard about that! maybe that was the replica?
106251	agent_2:Whoa! That is a lot of computing power! I and not believe Google has been around since 1998. agent_1:Yeah, it's been around for a while. Apparently, back in 2013 when Google crashed, it took 40% of web traffic with it. agent_2:I am not surprised at all. Did you know if you type the word askew into Google it will make the page tilted? How fun!	agent_1:Haha, I love when Google does stuff like that.
86574	agent_1:I did not know that. I wonder how that works? I played trumpet when I was younger but couldn't grow facial hair at the time so I am not a good test subject. agent_2:Maybe it gives them some barrier. Do you like basketball? agent_1:Makes sense... I do like basketball. Do you like it?	agent_2:Yes. I like the older players like Allen Iverson. He signed a lifetime contract with reebok
6876	agent_2:Is it really? That's kind of funny! Ha! I do know the pallbearers at Billy Mays' funeral wore khakis and blue shirts. That was very nice of them. agent_1:Interesting. In china the gang layered as many shirts as possible and popped their collars! agent_2:Now that's interesting. Ha! I also think it's interesting that button down is when collar tips fasten to the body of the shirt and button up does not. I never really realized that!	agent_1:Yeah I didn't know that either. I always thought polo shirts were designed by polo players but they were originally invented by tennis players!
99964	agent_2:He has some artistic integrity I guess. He teamed up with Alicia Keys to do a song about NYC called Empire State of Mind. agent_1:I actually like that song. I thought it was better than the Katy Perry and Snoop Dogg song California Girls, those two songs were meant to go head-to-head apparently agent_2:Yeah I never dug Snoop's whole schtick. I've been listening to Jay-Z since Reasonable Doubt.	agent_1:Yeah he's been going for a long time. Although not as long as since we had our rule change about vice-presidents, that was back in 1805
159701	agent_1:i would say that they are all competing for the attention of viewers by using whatever means  necessary. i trust south park for the news. they dont have an agenda. agent_2:I like how Kenny dies that never gets old lol great times, funny show agent_1:yes, they make fun of the tv tropes constantly. a lot of fun. Anyway, great chat!	agent_2:They also make fun of each other, of other shows so yeah a lot of fun, nice chat
93381	agent_2:I guess they stated an average goal every 44 seconds! That is just crazy! They probably lost some weight haha agent_1:That is crazy, I wonder how many fans of the Bulgaria team were still there at the end of the game? agent_2:That I am not sure of but wow, you would have to watch that to see how fast those players were moving! 	agent_1:Yeah that is true.  Did you know that Canada is the only country to have two national sports?
35840	agent_2:Superman, yes. I love superman. Do you like comics? agent_1:I do.  I prefer DC to Marvel, but I have enjoyed some of both.  It is humorous that Dracula once bit Superman and exploded because Superman is powered by the yellow sun. agent_2:HAHAHA. That's just great! I like DC a little more too.	agent_1:Nice talking with you.  Good bye.
90814	agent_2:That's just crazy, I knew the video was popular but never heard about that, so did you know the police also have a service called Blutube agent_1:I ddn't know that.  Justin Bieber's Baby is the most disliked video on youtube.  Do you know what Netflix and Youtube have in common? agent_2:What do they have in common? the fact that they both have a streaming service? 	agent_1:Together they both make up half of the peak internet traffic in North America.
53486	agent_1:do you like the guitar? agent_2:Yes I do. DId you know Van Halen once played it so much that is set the speakers on fire? agent_1:Yes he was playing the song Beat It	agent_2:Yeah. DO you know who has smashed the most guitars in a tour?
156892	agent_2:Yeah and they then give it to local libraries agent_1:Yes. Did you hear of the library of things where you can get more than just books out of it? agent_2:Yes pretty cool. Do you watch tv?	agent_1:A lot. I love to watch the SImpsons and you?
134207	agent_1:Here in the states it was Ringo, George Carlin, and Alec Baldwin.  They all did it for at least 52 episodes each.   agent_2:I think they are still making Thomas episodes, there must be a lot of them now, been going many years. agent_1:No way!  I'm going to have to look that up.  My kids used to watch it when they were little.  They were also into Pokemon.	agent_2:I think there is a huge difference in quality between Thomas and Pokemon.  Thomas was made to entertain, While I feel Pokemon was made to sell stuff.
157566	agent_1:No, I don't think I would feel comfortable going to that school.  agent_2:Not a fan. I am more a fan of sports. I love watching quarterbacks. I think that they are so gifted. Did you hear about Kellan Moore who is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl? agent_1:No, I'm surprised there aren't more left handers in the game. I suppose they have to build the team around the QB though. 	agent_2:Yep. Did you know that there have only been two african-american qbs to win the super bowl and both wins were against the broncos?
40548	agent_1:No, I haven't. I guess law school makes people think carefully about their life choices and what they really want to do with themselves.  agent_2:Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer? it makes sense because martial arts is basically like a dance that you practice agent_1:I guess it's an easier way to meet women, too. A lot more women want to dance than beat you up.	agent_2:haha makes sense to me, I dated a ballet dancer and ya her toes were messed up from the shoes, it doesn't surprise me that they can go through 4 pairs of shoes in a week.
26543	agent_1:I'd be interested in those!  Have you ever heard of the Antikythera mechanism? agent_2:Sorry ;) what is that ? agent_1:It's an artifact that was discovered and it's known as the world's first computer.  Get this- it was used by the Ancient Greeks.	agent_2:ok, this I must google after this HIT ;) I love to hear about stuff like that ! ;)
118923	agent_1:I wonder what language?  I can't believe that 2nd place in a presidential election was given VP -- that is prior to 1805.  Can you see Hillary and Trump working together?  Ha.  agent_2:They would disagree on anything and everything! 5 presidents have been elected after losing the popular vote! agent_1:Trump was one of them.  Do you like dogs?  It's amazing that dogs have 12 different blood types!	agent_2:Really? Dogs also drink with the underside of their tongues. I do like dogs, what about you?
115877	agent_1:Yeah, if your own daughter accuses you of that then that means something, he must be guilty and if his not guilty people wont vote for him after that agent_2:However I have personally known a family where the daughter made similar allegations because she didn't like her parents telling her what she could and couldn't do and it sure made a huge mess. Situations like that really mess up a family though.  agent_1:I agree, of course Jim Knoblach denied the accusations, he said she was trying to end his campaign, but she ended up ruining his reputation	agent_2:True! Are you into social media like Facebook?
63747	"agent_2:That's okay.  I sometimes get confused because our planet and its surrounding is so complex. agent_1:Seriously!  The planet uranus actually rotates sideways and ""rolls"" around the sun rather than ""spinning"" like the other planets agent_2:Oh wow.  I did not know that.  I understand that five planets in our solar system can be seen from earth.  "	agent_1:Wow!  I've definitely never seen it!
39691	agent_1:Me too, even if I don't watch it. I appreciate that people get awards for creating quality movies of all genres, especially dramas. I can't watch them nonstop, but I do like the overall idea of drama agent_2:That is great credit for them. Do you have a favorite drama? agent_1:Not really. I've considered watching the show House. Hugh Laurie gets paid a whopping $700,000 per episode, so it's no wonder he does so well in that role	agent_2:I love Dr. House! He's so funny when he's serious.
45752	agent_1:That is crazy. Allen Iverson signed with Reebok for life for $800,000 a year until 55 years old and then a cool $32 million payout after that. agent_2:Jesus Christ... I will never see money like that... pretty depressing :) I'm going to start practicing basketball starting NOW ;) lol agent_1:Yeah, sometimes they give back though. Steph Curry is part of a foundation that gives mosquito nets to protect families in Africa. For each 3 pointer the charity gets 3 dollars.	agent_2:Mosquito nets huh ? :) Well I'm glad he gave back some of those 800,000 a month ;) lol
17531	agent_2:I do, lets talk about that next , as of January 2018 they have more then 2.2 billion monthly active users agent_1:Hmmm, did you participate in the burger king promotion?  agent_2:I did not , not sure why they wanted people to unfriend others 	agent_1:Yeah, it is a little weird. I remember that promotion. How much is a whopper? $1.00?
36033	agent_2:Have you used the font bookerly agent_1:I've never heard of that, what is it? agent_2:Its a font amazon created specifically to be easy to read on digital screens	agent_1:Interesting I'll have to look into it! Anyways, nice chatting with you!
20946	agent_1:Sure, just don't bring your cat! It must be tough if people are allergic to dogs. agent_2:That's what I was thinking. agent_1:Well, I enjoyed chatting with you! Have a good night! 	agent_2:You too. Goodnight
79635	agent_1:Haha that guy. DO you use your phone much? agent_2:All the time actually, Do you know who invented the dial phone? agent_1:Hmm I am not sure. Did you ever use a rotary phone?	agent_2:It was an undertaker. I jave actually never used one and you?
64171	agent_1:I love netflix, but I feel like someone needs to challenge them so they don't take over everything agent_2:Yeah, I'm a fan of the new movies they're helping produce that wouldn't get produced otherwise, but they're definitely get too big in entertainment agent_1:I didn't see that Blockbuster could have bought them for a lot less than they are worth today.  Could have saved them	agent_2:Yeah, Blockbuster was a big part of my childhood. Too bad! And if Reed Hastings had been better about late fees, the world might have been completely different!
64721	agent_1:Do you use the internet frequently? agent_2:Yeah, I use Amazon a lot.  It has come a long way since being an online bookstore. agent_1:I agree. They sure have diversified to a substantial extent to be the largest online retailer	agent_2:Also, Netflix and Youtube are huge.  Blockbuster for sure is sorry it didn't buy Netflix before it got huge.
70158	agent_2:Yes, I have fond memories of those simpler days when you only had to process 54 colors on the screen; video games today are so detailed, they're like movies! agent_1:Well they remain a classic, but I do like the quality of today's games agent_2:I'm pretty old-fashioned in some of my entertainment choices; I remember the days of watching Bill Nye on PBS haha. Did you know he got his big break by winning a Steve Martin lookalike contest?	agent_1:But now I would argue he is more well known than steve martin
163299	agent_1:Yes that is amazing what he has accomplished. It would be a great teaching tool for you athletes. agent_2:Absolutely.    Too many kids these days do not want to put in the hard work and effort that it takes to get to the levels of professional athletes.   They think it will just happen over night.  agent_1:I did not know that the NFL uses tracking technology in the shoulder pads of football players to record every move on the field. That is pretty amazing.	agent_2:hmmm another tid bit of information that I was not aware of.  You are full of useful trivia knowledge.
73648	agent_1:No I never knew that that is pretty cool. I also didn't know that there is a type of competitive swimming where the athlete has their hands and legs bound and swims like a dolphin. agent_2:That is hilarious, I wonder if there are YouTube videos of that out there? agent_1:Ha ha I bet there are I will have to look some up. Apparently babies just a few weeks old have a survival response that allows them to hold their breath underwater.	agent_2:That is very cool, I never knew that about babies.
119475	agent_1:It would be a mess to have her as vice president, she doesnt get along with Trump and both have opposing views agent_2:Trump is a reality star. Maybe he would prefer sticking to entertainment, releasing some pop albums like the president of Indonesia. agent_1:I know right, and he should I would support him if it means he will leave office	agent_2:He could make more money off his supporters with the album sales; God knows he's not as rich as he says he is. The 3 wealthiest presidents were actually JFK, Washington, and Jefferson.
48885	agent_2:I think Hugh deserves every penny. He makes that show. He is a legend. Great American accent too. agent_1:Yeah, I was intrigued by House, though I don't usually like drama! Such an interesting character. agent_2:A flawed but brilliant character that the whole show revolved around. Hugh used to do comedy in the UK.	agent_1:Interesting. I wonder how he got into comedy. Speaking of comedy, Ryan Stiles dropped out of hih school to pursue a comedy career.
87171	agent_2:I think I'd rather play the NES, even if it only display 54 colors agent_1:It was one of the best forms of entertainment when I was a kid! I'd much rather play Nintendo than watch NBA. agent_2:I'm surprised the NES wasn't discontinued until 2003, I guess it was really popular	agent_1:It was! I saved mine and I'll give it to my son to entertain himself with when he's old enough to be careful with it.
95326	agent_2:hmmm... I would have to see it to believe it ;) I'm pretty skeptical ;) agent_1:You and lots of others, I'm sure.  Music has great mood enhancing properties, even babies love music.  It makes them happy. agent_2:any music ? what if it's a really mean rap song ? ;)	agent_1:Babies don't understand the lyrics, they like the beat.
58111	agent_2:well it's Donald Glover, I guess he got the name from an online name generator haha agent_1:Hahaha that is one way to do that. Do you know hwich is the most disliked video on youtuibe? agent_2:No I don't what is it? I do know that youtube did start as a dating site though	agent_1:It is Bieber's Baby. Nice chatting with you
95661	agent_1:Oh, no kidding that is funny. I have not seen that. agent_2:Yea, I think I stopped watching after 300 episodes. Funny thing is that Homer had 188 jobs in the first 400 episodes of the simpsons agent_1:Wow! That's a lot of jobs. 	agent_2:Yep. Do you watch SNL at all? Weekend update is their longest running skit
127799	agent_1:Yup.  Something else that I find interesting is that only dogs and elephants are animals that point instinctively agent_2:Google prefers dogs to cats. their code of conduct specifically states that they are a dog company. Do you have any dogs? agent_1:No, two cats, two kids, and one wife.  No dogs, but do find it interesting that dogs can see as many different colors as people can.	"agent_2:Yes that is interesting. I have one dog. Do you watch the Simpsons? I think it's crazy there is only one episode of ""the simpsons"" where bart neither appears, nor is mentioned"
52381	agent_1:Yes me too. Mercury and McCartney used the same piano to record one of their songs agent_2:Yeah Mercury recorded Bohemian Rhapsody and McCartney Hey Jude agent_1:Yeah pretty awesome, I wonder where that piano is now as it is historic.	agent_2:Exactly. There is a song that cannot be played by humans and is for stress testing pianos
158512	agent_1:I didn't realize that radio waves could induce an AC current.   agent_2:I didnt know that either. Guess you learn something new every day. Huh.  agent_1:Yep. Like Teddy Roosevelt banned Christmas trees in the WH.  He was an environmentalist that was ahead of his time. 	agent_2:Yeah I dont see that as being ahead of your time. I see that as being a scrooge.I mean come on you could have a fake tree at least.
91636	agent_1:I'm not sure who he is. Who is he?  agent_2:He was the main character in Mad Men.  I loved that show.  I guess he taught drama at his old high school. agent_1:Oh, I do know who he is. Was he a high school teacher before or something? 	agent_2:I'm not sure.  I never heard of him until Mad Men came along.  Did you ever listen to radio dramas?
164745	"agent_2:Yup, do you watch Game of Thrones at all?  I thought it was hilarious the author called the Pats, ""the Lannisters of the NFL."" agent_1:I do watch it and that makes sense lol the Pats have dominated the league for many years now agent_2:It is crazy how dominant they have been.  15 AFC East titles in 17 years in a sport with that much free agency is just unfathomable!"	agent_1:15 out of 17 no kidding!! that is amazing I dont think that will happen again in the history of the sport
41883	agent_2:yes, he knew the value of the event and used it to help others. very thoughtful. i wonder how many more years he has in him. agent_1:Hes 34 now, although he may be good, keeping up with younger players will start to get harder.   agent_2:yes, and he should think about exiting gracefully, which jordan did not do.	agent_1:Jordan did it once, but then kept coming back past his prime.
88522	agent_1:He is the greatest player of all time. He was the hold many awards of all time. He is the all-time NBA playoffs scoring leader. agent_2:If it was me I would pick Jordan as the GOAT. Thats just me though. However Lebron does make more money than judge judy which is saying a lot.  agent_1:Do you like Basketball ?	agent_2:I love basketball. How about you? Did you know that the league banned Air Jordans when they first came out?
113542	agent_2:I don't know but if anyone deserves grief it's the indonesian president who released 3 pop albums agent_1:Right!  Sounds like he had too much free time on his hands.  Did you know that the U.S. president has a guest house? agent_2:Yea and the President's guest house is larger than the actual white house	agent_1:Nice!  That's interesting.  President Obama's secret service codename is renegade.  That's kind of neat!
8541	agent_2:Since then it's like they have a new show new movie every other week. agent_1:It certainly seems that way. Some of them are really good, though! It's been nice talking to you, Have a great weekend! agent_2:You too, thanks!	agent_1:Goodbye!
53646	agent_2:I agree. You probably know this but the majority of Earth's polar regions are covered with ice. agent_1:I am worried about them melting.... you? agent_2:Me too. This is a scary time for our planet. Just recently I heard in the news there was a 7.3 magnitude earthquake in Venezuela .	agent_1:Wow.  That is scary.  It is really something that you cant prepare for.  I really hope people fared well, or as well as can be.
26898	agent_2:Yes maybe how bacteria can be used to clean nuclear waste.  It actually can...  It is sad that 80% of the Earth's natural forests have been destroyed.  That seems to be too high and drastic. agent_1:That is sad. When the earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long. agent_2:Yeah it would have been a long day.  The Earth was molten...  Is it true that all the Earth's helium will be gone by the end of this century?	agent_1:Yes, I have read that scary statistic.
154596	agent_1:The Patriots really are the team to beat. I remember way back when, they were terrible. Now TB and Bill are the best. agent_2:Right, they really brought that team together. Tom Brady is really pretty special. I didn't realize he was that old, I guess. Not that 41 is old, but for a footballer.. agent_1:He must be getting close to retirement. I can't imagine money is an issue. Nor is legacy.	agent_2:I would imagine he must be. I think the Patriots are kind of seeing the end of an era not. Belichick is 66, Rob Gronkowski is pondering hanging up his hat it sounds like. Maybe if they had won the superbowl against the eagles it would have been different.
66869	agent_1:They have really come a long way. And funny enough, they had to upgrade their view count to 64 bits because of Gangnam style. agent_2:I guess Gagnam Style made history, good thin it forced youtube to upgraid there servers, That video was really popular and funny indeed. agent_1:True. And even police have their own youtube balled bluetube.	agent_2:I wonder what kind of videos are inside the Bluetube database, I wonder if its only mistakes or also good stunts. and training exercises.
6906	agent_2:I'm not sure how easy that would be with all the food safety laws we have here in the US. Maybe that's why it hasn't become popular here.  agent_1:That's true.  Did you know that dogs have 12 different blood types and can donate at blood drives? agent_2:I wonder if their blood types work similarly to ours? I know some dogs would be able to give more blood than others based on their size	agent_1:I'm not sure, but they probably work the same, I'd think.  I'm sure there's a big need especially for dogs with cancers.
83319	agent_1:Oh I see so you must relate to the article as well, its hard when you are all alone in your home and your kids are gone agent_2:We downsized from our family home of 20 years in 2017, and enjoying living in a condo on the lake.  Busy during the summer, but quiet this time of year.   agent_1:I see, so changing the subject a bit, do you like cars?	agent_2:Yes I enjoy a good car ride.  I prefer to drive in rural areas and enjoy the scenery rather than in hustle bustle of city driving.
122731	agent_1:Oh yeah,  love target. How about you? agent_2:ya I like it, I used to only buy on amazon but now target will price match amazon agent_1:Oh thats good,  then you can get it right away.  I learned that Vermont was the only state to not have a target,  but I think they are getting one soon. I saw it on the news or something. 	agent_2:ah nice well I wont move there, also they dont carry tobacco which is interesting
24207	agent_2:Wow that is cool. I think it's interesting that the phrase pull oneself up by their bootstraps originally meant to do something impossible and not to just help yourself agent_1:That is interesting!  A man stopped to get his boots cleaned in Paris in 1938.  As a result of standing still for 7 minutes, both he and the cleaner became the first people in history to be photographed.  I've seen that photo before.  They didn't even know they were being photographed because they were part of a bigger picture of the neighborhood. agent_2:That is really crazy what a lucky guy! It would be cool to be the first person to get a picture taken, what do you think about traveling by the way? I just got back from Florida myself	agent_1:I love traveling!  The Dutch are creating a commuter bus designed to travel at 160mph!  I would travel more regionally if I could take that and get where I was going safely.
70823	agent_2:Btw, saying about McDonalds... Did you know that drive-thru was added in 1975 because of soldiers, who weren't able to get out of their cars? agent_1:I guess the McDonald's saw the potential in the troops to consume vast quantities of junk food whilst ensconced safely in their vehicles. Smart thinking. Now they need to put McD's in combat zones for the troops. agent_2:lol In South African you may equip your car with flame-throwers to prevent carjacking	agent_1:That would come in handy at the drive thru at McD's in a combat zone too.
112040	agent_2:That makes sense, I only remember him at the power plant though.  The Simsons crew sent south park flowers when it aired it's family guy episode, isn't that funny. agent_1:Thats awesome!  and supportive!   agent_2:Or one could perceive it as sticking it to the Family Guy show.  HaHa!  I don't know if you like pokemon, but I can't believe there is over 750 episodes of that show, that's a lot of tv.	agent_1:That is a lot of pokemon!  Its been good chatting.
85	agent_1:Yeah pretty cute. Did you know Tupac was a ballet dancer? agent_2:Yes he was in the nutcracker as the mouse king agent_1:Yeah. DO you like SHakespeare?	agent_2:I love his work. Did you know he popularized many terms that we use to this day?
95726	agent_2:i tried to read a lot. i enjoy it and find it a good way to keep the mind sharp. you? agent_1:I read more from a computer screen than paper.  I can't believe there was a moral panic in the 18th century because people were reading novels.  If they could see us now! agent_2:poetry was the stuff of morality. novels covered all sort of base behavior.  LOL. anyway, great chat!	agent_1:Yes, thanks you were great!
32413	agent_2:He must be very talented and has good imagination. agent_1:Yes, he did. There was even a Garfield comic, Pet Force agent_2:Do you know that there is a superhero called normalman?  That's a weird name.	agent_1:I think it's cute, it's because he didn't have powers. The only one on a planet of superheroes.
162410	agent_2:I have been to Fed EX field, not RFK. Alex Smith is one of my favorite QB's. He started college as a junior.  Sad about his injury this year. agent_1:yeah that's too bad. I think part of the reason I gave up on football was I never had a fair shot because I'm left handed. Even now there is only 1 left handed qb in all of the nfl. agent_2:Yes, that is statistically odd. When did the Redskins move to the new field?	agent_1:hmm It was 1997 when they moved into FedEx Field.
110346	agent_1:lol, I could see that totally happen lol. Did you know Reagan was an actor before becoming president? agent_2:Yea, he was once rejected for a film role because he didn't look too presidential  agent_1:yea, that is so crazy, times were different and he was different then also probably. Do you own a car?	agent_2:Yea, it's pretty beat up though. I wish I could equip it with a flame thrower like you can in South Africa
56299	agent_1:Who is she?  Is she working for Google? agent_2:She was the actress from the Twlight Movies, not someone I would think write any paper let alone one on ai agent_1:I thought the name was familiar -  I was confused.  Apparently, New York's are code was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone.  	agent_2:Apparently the inventor of the dial telephone was an undertaker paranoid that operators were rerouting his calls
43584	agent_2:I heard he bought a Winnie The Pooh book for an absurd amount of money.  agent_1:Yeah that seems very odd to me. Must be a Canadian thing. There is a university called Drake University and he actually stopped by in the middle of the night to visit with the students. agent_2:I didn't know he was from Canada to be honest. I think that is pretty cool. What about Bruce Lee, are you a fan? 	agent_1:Yeah I love Bruce Lee and think the kung fu genre is pretty cool. I had no idea he was a championship dancer back in 1958.
157734	agent_1:Oh my gosh. That would be so miserable for both of them. They would get nothing done! agent_2:It would be more cutthroat than it is now for sure and it's bad enough already.  But he's rooting out the moles and weasels and draining that swamp, like he said, so good for him.  agent_1:If nothing else, he can release 3 pop albums. That would be a good hobby.	agent_2:Hey, nothing is beyond his ability.  It wouldn't shock me a bit.  He won't retire like all the other ex presidents and write books and do speeches.  People are going to see something different with him.
63043	agent_1:I know right? lol  Do you watch fox news? agent_2:Yeah, sometimes, I honestly try not too watch too much of ANY news (except local channels) because it tends to be a bit depressing...  agent_1:I don't watch it.  I was surprised to see though that it is watched more than CNN and MSNBC combined.  It's been fun chatting!	agent_2:hey, you too, been great chatting with ya!
52374	agent_1:She played Erin Hannon on the office, she displays so much positivity and her bubbly personality can sure turn a frown upside down! agent_2:Oh ok I know who you are talking about now.  I used to love watching that show every thursday night back in college.  agent_1:Yeah, it's a great show! I read somewhere that it is one of the most streamed shows on Netflix. Interesting to read how some of these actors got into acting, like Michael Caine became an actor because all the prettiest girls were in drama class. I think it really paid off then.	agent_2:I think that is so rad, isn't it funny when you look back and small decisions based on something totally different change the rest of your life?
119164	agent_2:True. As long as it doesn't take too long to get where you are going to. But I bet they get a ton of sun. agent_1:Speaking of the sun, did you know that it is actually white and only perceived as yellow because of atmospheric scattering? agent_2:Interesting. I know it's really quite hot. And large.	agent_1:LOL  yes.  One thing hotter than the sun is a lightening bolt, which is 5 times hotter than the sun!
55899	agent_1:They are both things I don't think people on Mackinac island could imagine after having motorized vehicles banned for over 100 years. agent_2:Maybe I should move there.  I'm sick of the expense of cars. Iceland's a possibility too, most of them don't have cars. agent_1:I agree it might not be a bad thing to have some cars off the streets. Islanders using domestic flights to get from town to town is interesting.	agent_2:It would take some adjustment for me.  Funny, the first king to travel around the world was King Kalakaua of Hawaii?  Hawaii has a king?
146142	agent_2:I bet he LOVED that name. That is just the name that people would give the president of an African country. I wonder whether observers get blocked from the polls in African countries. agent_1:that's a good question, and I wonder if he were the taller candidate between everyone that was running? that would fit with the statistic that the taller person wins more often in these races agent_2:I wonder whether that stat applies to women. I would imagine that women are evaluated differently than men.	agent_1:that is a great question, I think they need to do more research on this subject or look at winning politicians in other countries
37622	agent_1:Back to your previous comment.  Can you seriously image WaPo saying anything positive about the NRA?  I never got the Princess Leia turn on... It's been featured on Friends and The Big Bang Theory.  agent_2:Just think if Leia had facebook in that future.  Imagine all the stormtroopers standing around looking at their phones!  That would be a hoot.  I knew about Zuckerburg's color blindness.  I used to wonder if any Facebook employee would make a fake page in all green and see how he would react.   agent_1:One would probably get fired.  I think it's very interesting that one fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving fantasy and reality.  I wonder if people like Van Gogh had something going on there as opposed to most thinking he was schizophrenic. 	agent_2:I guess it's thoughts like that explain why I had to keep changing jobs.  I am a big fan of fantasy literature.  I've got a long list of authors that I am working my way through.  Terry Pratchett is one of them, I guess he's British.
90054	agent_2:Great for her! Carol Burnett was the first celebrity to appear on Sesame Street! agent_1:I didnt know that! I liked robin williams as genie in Aladdin! i didnt know that started the trend though!  agent_2:Me neither. Do you like The Voice? 	agent_1:I haven't watched it before. What is it?
64159	agent_1:Maybe.  I'm so glad a grew up before social media agent_2:Same. I can see good sides to it, though. Like if you're a bit of an outsider, it's easier to find a community through social media/online. Seems like the case for Article Section 4. agent_1:Did you see the, Jim carrey doesn't make dramas any more because his beilef system prevents him from playing in movies that don't project positivity?	agent_2:Yeah! Knew he changed his views on a few things, but didn't know that.
13305	agent_2:You gotta have a sense of humor about these things!  Like when Taylor Swift acceidnetally release 8 seconds of white noise, which ended up topping the charts in Canada! Tat is a great commentary on what Canadians enjoy about Swift music... agent_1:I guess it is all about the brand agent_2:Maybe. Do you think her proclivity to walk backwards to avoid having her photo taken is brand-building?	agent_1:No. I genuinely think paparazzi are jerks
125086	agent_1:The price that was quoted back then was 75 million and now they're worth billions.  agent_2:I could only imagine how the value changes over time as well as the amount of users that increased over the same time period. Actually I have heard over 2.2 billions users. agent_1:Yeah at their IPO release they were worth 104 billion and that was back in 2012.	agent_2:That is just amazing to me to read that. speaking of reading; did you know that CS Lewis and Tolkien had competitions for reading poetry and if the other person laughed they lost.
29080	agent_2:Yeah I think that might be true, so you are probably right.  agent_1:Do you like poetry? agent_2:Yeah I do, but don't read too often, how about you?  Do you have any favorites?	agent_1:I like The Raven by Edgar Allen Poe, what about you?
18417	agent_2:That's only because the police are not as brave as batman. agent_1:For sure, all that crime would get so old lol. Batman is pretty cool, I never knew he was made in 1939. agent_2:Yep, along with all of the other comic heroes	agent_1:True, who is your favorite super hero ever?
20688	agent_1:I know. Can you imagine some of the great films of the past that would not be released because they studio might think it would flop? agent_2:Or how many flops that have made millions from becoming cult classics?  agent_1:Yeah. I feel like Super Troopers is one of those and I LOVE that movie. All of those movies they are in.	agent_2:Breakfast club has to be up there as a cult classic for me. I can't believe the lack of script and the acting genius that came through.
6723	agent_1:No I didn't know that that's crazy. also crazy is that baseball is super popular in Japan, they even think that it is their National Pastime and not ours LOL agent_2:lol  Babe Ruth who was known for home runs was caught stealing to end game 7 of the 1926 world series?  Interesting useless stat.  lol agent_1:Haha what's an interesting stat. Do you ever watch Game of Thrones? I know that's a change of topic	agent_2:I've seen it but don't follow it close.  I know it got financed by Ireland because they film scenes there which boosts tourism incomes.
26827	agent_1:I guess theres no escape, thats a lot of land, they should sell some of it and pay off some of the mayor debt the government has. agent_2:Then again, it is easy to lie like the guy who impersonated a government official in France and sold the Eiffel tower twice! agent_1:Yeah I guess it is, he did sold the lie twice so that is pretty amazing if you think about it humans are amazing.	agent_2:Yes.    Despite not being the fastest or strongest, humans are among the best distance runners in the animal kingdom.
74785	agent_1:I guess he slipped them drugs. I guess the judge (so far) has allowed only one to take the witness stand. agent_2:Right the retrail begins on April 2nd agent_1:Well, there's no shortage of witnesses.  What a circus.  If nothing else, with all the legal expenses, he'll get screwed one way or another.  Isn't he in poor health?	agent_2:Yeah I believe he is
116380	agent_1:Hi There ! Looking forward to chat with You ! ;) agent_2:You too. Do you watch SNL? I heard Weekend Update was on the first show and is their longest running skit. agent_1:I used to did. Pretty funny but it got predictable ;)	agent_2:I don't watch network TV anymore. I cut the cable. I don't even stream wifi. I just use my phone at the library to download shows off Prime and then watch them at home. So I have no cable, dish, or wifi bill. Do you watch the Simpsons? Homer has had 188 jobs since it started.
22283	agent_2:Yeah For reality-obsessed country music fans, that's a serious piece of bubble gum to chew on. agent_1:I guess having her music inspired by hallucinogens has helped out. She is making the big money! agent_2:yes she is! But Musgraves knows that the real meaning of a song lies in how the voice illuminates the words.	agent_1:Also in how the song makes you feel too!
20478	agent_2:I do, actually! I just can't believe he graduated high school at the age of 25 back in 2012. What about you? agent_1:That is crazy, I bet he grew in a poor family, I do like him, think he has a lot of talent agent_2:He does. I like how he visited Drake University right after the students there gave up on trying to get Drake there during a tour stop!	agent_1:Canada has great artists, do you follow Justin Bieber as well?
44652	agent_2:Me too. Did you know Starship Troopers is on the reading list for 3 different branches of the military? agent_1:I didn't know it was a book to be honest, I have just seen the movie. Enders game looks to be also suggested by the military. agent_2:I didn't know it was a book either. The world record for speed reading was 4700 words per minute.	agent_1:That is so fast. I would like to talk to Anne Jones and learn more about how she does this.
59848	agent_2:Oh wow I didn't know that. Funny though! agent_1:It is! I mean, he is such a great actor and the whole reason he even does it is because he wanted to take a class where all the pretty girls were in school! agent_2:LOL! Jon Hamm taught drama at his old high school and one of his students was Ellie Kemper.	agent_1:I've seen him in a movie, I think it was about baseball.  i never realized that he was a teacher at some point in real life.
49851	"agent_1:The Nintendo Entertainment System was finally discontinued in September of 2003 in Japan.The technology advances, but the games don't always get better. agent_2:That is one heck of a good run for a video game system I will say though.  agent_1:Did you hear that Bill Nye ""the Science guy"" got his break in entertainment by winning a Steve Martin lookalike contest. I guess thatâs a pretty amazing makeup job there. "	agent_2:I think I have heard that before, did you ever watch his show?
12687	agent_2:that is crazy! what is weird is that greenland can't join FIFA because there isn't enough grass there for a soccer field! agent_1:That seems like it is limiting. What about turf. Why can't they play on turf, FIFA? agent_2:ya I wonder if they require natural grass? I don't watch sports so I have no idea about the rules of soccer	agent_1:So if you don't watch sports, what do you do in your free time. I watch sports, all the time...
146189	agent_1:Yup I like that as well, and I would like to see North Korea come out with negotiations to denuclearize that would be excellent, also crazy did you know the white house guest house is bigger than the actual white house? agent_2:Ya know I totally believe that because I visited Washington DC and stood in front of the White House and was surprised a how small it is.  agent_1:ya the last time I was there I was back in middle school, that was a long time ago, have you been there recently? Is it still worth going	agent_2:I was there about 9 years ago and really loved the visit. I was amazed at the America history and all of the memorials. It is an awesome place and believe everyone should visit at least once.
12532	agent_2:Well, Amazon is gunning for them in all aspects, that's for sure. Who would have guessed that a simple online bookstore would diversify so much. They sell and stream everything now! agent_1:Yeah, and they own Whole Foods too. agent_2:And since 1998 they've owned IMDB.com. They really have their hands in a lot of buckets, don't they?	agent_1:Yep. And unfortunately they're setting the pace for how labor is treated. The conditions in their warehouses will probably be copied in a lot of other service industries if somebody doesn't do something.
24172	agent_2:I am surprised that that an african tribe made the style of clothes of their former German occupiers their own style. agent_1:I'm surprised at how durable military clothing is and their wide use of wool.  One guy had a wool coat that weighed 8 pounds! agent_2:I wonder if any africans within that african tribe that was occupied by Germany dissented from wearing victorian clothes because they anyone who does as a traitor.	agent_1:Probably and payed a dear price.  I'm not a big shopper.  Maybe I should buy military coats because the last longer.  Actually, all military stuff does, even their buttons.
1613	agent_2:That's funny. A group climb Britain's highest mountain back in 2006 and found a piano on top. agent_1:I couldn't even imagine the ordeal it would have been for whomever had to take that piano up there originally.  An aluminum grand piano weighs 356 pounds and that's light compared to a regular piano. agent_2:Wow that's much lighter compared to a regular one.	agent_1:Freddie Mercury used the same piano to record Bohemian Rhapsody that Paul McCartney used to record Hey Jude.
129611	"agent_1:In most countries they call it football! agent_2:Yea and ""soccer"" is consider slang for Association football agent_1:Good chat take care!"	agent_2:You too
100557	"agent_1:That's strange. I wonder how that works if a particular genre doesn't have enough Canadian artists to fulfill that 40%...a lot of repeat songs I guess? agent_2:I imagine that there aren't enough Canadian rappers, the only one I can think of is Aubrey ""Drake"" Graham, which i suppose is a perfect segue back to the rap history subject agent_1:Hah there you go! I didn't know that was his full name though. I'm interested to hear a ""compliment battle"" in action. I read that is a new type of freestyle invented by Korean rappers"	agent_2:I had never heard of a compliment battle before.
126093	agent_1:I think so. The president of Indonesia on the other had is also a pop artist agent_2:That was interesting regarding the Indonesian president.  I wonder if he is any good. agent_1:not sure, he has released 3 pop albums though so maybe he is	agent_2:I read that there has never been a us president that was neither a democrat or a republican.
158329	agent_1:Yes, great for commuting.  Using waves to carry info agent_2:Since I am Canadian, 40% of the music on the radio that I hear come from  canadian artist. It is a great way to know them.  agent_1:Is that an official requirement?	agent_2:Yes, It is to promote canadian culture, I suppose you don't have to worry about another culture giant if you come from the US.
146349	agent_2:I would be more than happy to stay off my phone. The water would be a bonus! agent_1:Yeah it would. I heard the Zimbabwean president was called President Banana. Perhaps Trump could have a nickname too? agent_2:A proper noun and a descriptor, I like it!	agent_1:I speak English good! The president of Indonesia has released 3 Pop albums. Perhaps Trump could do some cool jazz?
152966	agent_2:That is good for people who like them and who have time.  Free is always good. agent_1:Everyone like free!! Apparently keeping a drawer full of candy is traditions for the US senate.   agent_2:I wonder if they have their dentists working at the capitol.	agent_1:Funny!! treats included Milky Way, Mars Bars and Jellybeans.
67717	agent_2:Well interesting fact about this specie is that they can eat preys that are twice its lenght and ten times its weight. agent_1:Holy cow, that is amazing!  Ten times its weight is incredible.  Did you know that 84% fo the genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts found in zebrafish? agent_2:I did not know that, interesting fact I will use it next time I have dinner with friends, that would definetly impress them.	agent_1:Yeah that is definitely impressive to say the least.  On a different subject, are you much of a car fan?
4605	agent_1:I did watch the world series, and as you can imagine I was once again disappointed in the Dodgers. Did you know that in 1992 the US marines carried the canadian flag upside down? agent_2:I can believe it.  lol Which way does that leaf go anyway? agent_1:To tell you the truth I would have to look it up. But what an embarrassment. 	agent_2:I know right, I think I would have googled it,, before walking out!
51384	agent_2:the original NES! thats why MegaMan is blue, there are more shades of blue than any other color on that chip agent_1:I agree. Nintendo was discontinued in Japan back in 2003. agent_2:yea which is crazy, the Gamecube was out by then so they didnt need to keep making the NES at that point	agent_1:That is pretty crazy. People in Britain around 50BC bred chickens not for food, but for entertainment.
146990	agent_2:Yeah, it is the only one in the league that is owned by a city govt. agent_1:D you know how they got their name? its actually a really interesting story agent_2:I dont know. how did they get their name?	agent_1:Because of an Indian packing company called Green Bay Packers, they paid for the team's uniforms and so they named the team after the company. Anyways its been great chatting with you
42724	agent_1:That's true, same in my day. Its just ridiculous!! Not very smart! In one state they want 16 years old to vote. Its getting out of hand!! agent_2:It is...  agent_1:True! I think these kids need a wake up call. I worry they aren't going to be able to cope when they grow up! Thinking everyone know Polo shirts were invented for tennis. Maybe not! Great chat!!	agent_2:Yeah, I've never played polo in mine.  Thanks and keep the faith.  You were great!
116347	agent_1:Probably!  Only like half of the people on reddit actually vote! agent_2:Maybe if the elections were held on Reddit we would have better turnout?   agent_1:Haha right!  Its funny that the first comment on reddit was a complaint!	agent_2:Sounds about right!  At least it isn't all negative.  There is a subredit that actually summarizes the nicest things done on Reddit.
40256	agent_2:Yeah, i understand! people want to carve out there own identity. Jazz is pretty big. you might find something in there to call your own. agent_1:My son has just started playing the saxophone, maybe that will be my way in.  Unless he's really bad at it and it makes me flee more. agent_2:The sax is a great instrument. your son will learn to appreciate music much more. anyway, great chat!	agent_1:You too, I'm going to log into Spotify and play some Miles Davis.  Have a good day.
103543	agent_1:Yes, especially Forrest Gump.  That was a great movie. I think I'll have to dig that out and watch it over the weekend, now! Kurt Russell does an excellent voice imitation of Elvis, too. agent_2:Did you know Elvis was actually Blonde?  He dyes his hair black. agent_1:Yes, i actually remember seeing one of his old movies and he was a blonde. He looked better blonde (I thought). I heard Elvis was born in Tupelo, Mississippi.  That makes me think of Tupelo Honey by Van Morrison but I digress. I didn't think Elvis's dance was too sensual or sexual but apparently the 50's generation did!	agent_2:I think they werent use to all the hip motion lol I dont think it was sexual either,  just a different type of dance lol
104246	agent_2:Yes about 4 and a half billions years. I do find it really interesting, but it can make you feel so insignificant. agent_1:It really can especially considering humans represent such a small part of Earth's history. agent_2:Yes have you ever watch Cosmos? Earth is densest planets in our solar system.	agent_1:I have.  It is so fascinating.  I love  Neil de Grasse Tyson
11123	agent_1:Yes so much easier. In South Korea it's illegal for kids 16 and under to play video games past midnight. I would have broken the law a lot if I grew up there! agent_2:Me too and I wonder how they can tell. Do you know who Stephen Fry is? agent_1:Isn't he that narrator who narrated little big planet, and some other games as well? I thought his name sounded familiar, I would probably recognize his voice. 	agent_2:Yes he did that and the harry potter and hitchhiker's guide to galaxy, such a talent
85639	agent_1:I can believe that. Also a lightening bolt is hotter than the surface of the sun.  agent_2:That seem hard to believe, but again, when thinking about it, a lightning bolt is truly fire. agent_1:Yeah, that is pretty cool, huh? Ever read the terms of service off the internet? 	agent_2:Yes I read it before, but all the Internet services i had, say one thing and after having it for a while it seem to lose speed.
38910	agent_2:Isnt it what makes the creepy type noises in sci-fi or horror movies agent_1:It is. It makes the jarring metallic noise.  agent_2:This is totally off subject but I just saw something interesting.  There is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans.  	agent_1:I wonder what it is but if it causes fear I'm also really not up for experiencing it.
124967	agent_1:They have used live goats in the past to take care of the lawns compared to hiring people.  agent_2:That is quite creative.  Giving new employees a beanie cap to wear sounds fun too.  I think it would be quite an experience to work at Google. agent_1:I agree. They moved their headquarters to Mountain view, California in 2004 the same year they offer their IPO	agent_2:I use Google everyday.  It's hard not to use Google.  Cloud computing certainly contributes to their huge presence.
163319	agent_1:Did you know it only had 54 colors? agent_2:I did actually.  I seem to remember that it stopped being made around 2003? agent_1:Yes, it was a great console and so much fun to play with	agent_2:Are you a football fan?  This season was great ending with the Super Bowl
148782	agent_2:Ha ha. I could always tell that dogs understood pointing but I recently found out that dogs and elephants are the only animals that instinctively understand pointing. Very interesting.  agent_1:Elephants too? Wow! Are they the only two animals  that understand pointing or are there more? It's crazy how uniquely attuned to human behavior dogs are! agent_2:I agree. We should all be more like Istanbul when it comes to dogs. They have vending machines that release food and water for the city's stray dogs in exchange for recycled plastic water bottles. 	agent_1:I agree with that. So many stray dogs starve, It would be nice if we could do more to help them. After all, they help us in so many ways like hunting, protecting us, pulling loads, etc. It's the least we could do in return.
102967	agent_2:Yeah, I'm trying to fathom just how much water  must be donated by Unicef for all the minutes people aren't using their phone. I wonder how they even measure a day's worth of clean water? agent_1:It must be hard to meassure and Im guessing many people dont know about that, I would definetely stop using my cellphone as much. agent_2:Yeah I can definitely go awhile without using it, I'm not one of those people always on  my apps and in my phone. I could survive with a flip phone for a little while! 	agent_1:Yeah me too, I will read the service of contract better next time I purchase an internet plan, only 7% of people read the whole terms, you never know what you are signing up for.
136866	agent_2:Hello there, I do and use it about once a day.  How about you? agent_1:I have it though I try to stay away from it. It's very distracting. Maybe I should have joined the Burger King promo where if I unfriended ten people on FB I'd get a free Whopper. agent_2:Yeah I don't use it nearly as often as I used to.  And wow that is a pretty crazy promotion!	agent_1:I know it's still going strong though. In Iceland they even use it to help them modify the constitution!
93338	agent_1:Can you imagine Hilary Clinton and Trump at the white house. agent_2:Never, Omg!! We have enough to deal with! lol agent_1:Yeah!!! I know. Do you know by any chance what the first president of Zimbabwe was called?	agent_2:Ha, ha, ha! Wasn't it banana? My goodness, How would it be to be called president banana!
36073	agent_2:Vaguely. There's been so many recently. Was that Florida? agent_1:It was in Florida and hit the Panhandle on Oct 10 near Panama City.  agent_2:I think I remember it better now. I think it did a lot of damage and essentially shut everything down. There was panic and looting if I remember correctly. 	agent_1:Yeah, it did. Apparently a lot of the people down there had to dig their homes out the surroundings.
39650	agent_2:Actually, we need helium for a lot of things. I don't know anything about baseball, so I wouldn't know. If I were to find baseball cards in my grandpa's attic, I would toss them. Unlike that man who found millions of dollars in cards. agent_1:Cool. I never know how dependent we are on helium here on Earth. What are them most important things we use helium for? agent_2:It's a non-renewable resource. The UN actually appointed a UN ambassador for extraterrestrials. Unreal. Maybe the know something about baseball?	agent_1:Yes, of course, that's why the earth will soon run out of helium, but I was just wondering what we actually use it for that's important? I know we need carbon and oxygen...but helium?
120175	agent_2:Speaking of Judge Judy, did you know her bailiff pulls in more than a million a year. He is one of the most wealthy bailiffs in the world. agent_1:That's absolutely crazy! See, it's all about the show of it all and not about the actual job/talent. A bailiff making more than a million a year just because he's being watched by America to do his job is unreal. agent_2:Yeah in America it is really about the people you know/your family knows. You can be a talent less hack and as long as your family knows the right people it makes no difference, hence how we get people like the Kardashians.	agent_1:I couldn't agree more. Well, at least we have talent like LeBron James out in the world!
29292	agent_2:He probably just stops by Guitar Center and gets another. I'm sure he can get one for free by signing a few others. agent_1:Thats a good trade! agent_2:Do you like to listen to music on vinyl?	agent_1:I dont listen to anything on vinyl actually.  Its been great chatting! Thank you.
27130	agent_1:lol  I was surprised to find out that Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon was still of the best selling albums of 2014 more than 40 years after it was first released. agent_2:That album is a classic. Have you tried Dark Side of Oz? agent_1:What is that?  I never heard of it?	agent_2:At a certain point in the movie Wiz of Oz, start the Dark Side album. It syncs up pretty well with the movie. Or so I've heard. Anyway, great chat!
110544	agent_1:Yea I like to swim when I have the time. It's insane the US has more gold medals in swimming than the rest of the world combined agent_2:It is crazy! we have great swimmers maybe they all used that banned swimsuit that 94% of the races were won using it agent_1:I never knew cornell university required students to pass a basic swimming test before graduation	agent_2:I think thas a great thing, swimming is a basci skill needed for survival more universities should do the same thing, promote swimming
163531	agent_2:Yes they did. Did you know a German by the name of Karl Benz Invented the mercedes benz? agent_1:Yes i did learned about that!, 1886 was a key year for him and for the automobile industry! agent_2:Can you imagine buying property and find a burn full of classic cars. How is this possible unless it was purchase from a millionaire?	agent_1:Of course. i had never learned of that happening! But i learned of someone becoming a professional car race when beating 90.000 players of gran turismo video game!
63074	agent_1:Ha!  When you said vending machines for stray dogs, thought you meant they sold dogs via vending machines.  But then recalled reading something about those vending machines dispensing food for the strays.  That's pretty cool.  They should make a movie about that!  I'd watch it on Netflix! agent_2:I would too! You have Netlix too? I didn't know they have dog blood drives? Have you seen the police dogs that can do CPR? amazing. agent_1:That's pretty amazing. Dog blood drives?  I could see that being turned into a movie as well.  Actually I could see that turning into a horror film! Though I don't care for horror films much.  Too gory and macabre. 	agent_2:OH,
111151	agent_2:I have Netflix and Hulu streaming on my TV and on my computer I watch NBC and ABC for weekly tv shows....I won't pay the cable cost anymore just internet service. agent_1:I'm waiting for my contract to end and I'm keeping the internet but canceling the cable!  Did you know that Entertainment like storytelling and dance were once for Royal Courts and over time became available to all citizens?  agent_2:Thats what I did, cable is too much. No I didn't know that! Very interesting. Did you know there is a show called IKEA Heights.....that was shot inside an IKEA store without the store knowing?? lol	"agent_1:Oh my goodness, that's funny! I never have heard of IKEA Heights, I will have to check that out! Did you know Ronald Reagan was rejected for a movie role playing a president because the entertainment executive said Mr. Reagan didn't have ""That presidential"" look!"
34022	agent_1:That's a good point. Funny is easier because it doesn't have to be so accurate. It's funny that DC stands for Detective Comics so the real name is Detective Comics Comics! agent_2:Yes, a silly name, since few of the stories are about detectives. What do you think about the universe? If you could fold a piece of paper in half 103 times it would be as thick as the observable universe. agent_1:That's a hard thing to picture for me. Hard to visualize. I wonder if that will change if they are right about there being a region of space that may be pulling galaxies outside our observable universe?	agent_2:I wonder how that is possible, but the universe is huge and mysterious. In fact, the universe may exist inside a black hole.
23951	agent_1:No, but I really want to see it, I heard it was pretty good.  I also know it did really well at the box office.  agent_2:I liked it, I thought it was pretty good, specially because the movie explained her past and how she came to be Wonder Woman. agent_1:Yeah and I also heard that Gal Gadot was awesome.  I think there will be more Wonder Women films to come. 	agent_2:There definetely will, there is a tough competition from Marvel although I like Marvel movies a lot more.
51392	"agent_1:Hi, how are you? Do you like comedy? agent_2:Hello - I'm doing great thank you. I love comedy, what about you? agent_1:Yes, i do. I don't agree with BIll Murray though. He thinks Kung fu Hustle is ""the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy""."	agent_2:I don't agree with him either. That movie isn't very funny I don't think.
123206	agent_2:I am not sure,  but I guess since its a commuter bus,  probably between big cities,  to and from work,  places that have a lot of businesses.  I wish we had that here,  would be nice.  agent_1:Well it has to go inbetween some cities. Maybe Amazon know?  agent_2:Why would amazon know?  Also,  another weird fact,  Iceland has no public rail transportation,  most natives that dont have cars just fly domestic. 	agent_1:Who knows! Amazon has a clock in the mountain!
52766	agent_1:Yep I don't think that guy has to worry about money ever again LOL. What do you think about Air Jordans by the way? agent_2:I agree lol, his all set up for life, I think the Air Jordans are great shoes, I love them. agent_1:Have you ever worn them? I know they're expensive. Also they were originally banned by the NBA	agent_2:I have, really comfortable shoes, and really they got banned? I cant recall a game with Jordan without wearing those,
68932	agent_1:Do you like to watch Netflix? agent_2:I watch netflix all the time. What about you? Do you use netflix? agent_1:I do like to watch it im one of the 59 millions of subscribers in the USA	agent_2:Ah, well I am also one of them. Netflix has almost 150 movies with a 100% rating on rotten tomatoes.
139287	agent_2:Oh, that's nice. Do you think television is useful for everyone? agent_1:to a point, it is. There is onyl one episode that Bart does not appear in, in the simpsons  agent_2:Yes, This long-running animated comedy focuses on the eponymous family in the town of Springfield in an unnamed U.S. state. 	agent_1:I can not believe there are over 750 pokemon episodes
122665	agent_2:ONE MORE TIME is their hit single. I love that song. Damn, I want some pancakes now as well. I guess I will go to Denny's soon. agent_1:Haha! Do it! Blast One More Time on the way there. I like that song, what is it called, Get Lucky? agent_2:Yes. Get lucky is the song you should listen to before you go to the casino. Do you gamble? 	agent_1:No, I don't. Well, great talking to you!
143823	agent_2:Hi, security measures sure cost a lot but are necessary to protect the lives of the attendees. agent_1:Agreed. Well on a more positive gaming note, did you ever play the Nintendo? Hard to believe the company itself has been around for over 100 years and actually started as a playing card company! agent_2:I still own the 1985 one and it works . My favorite game is Super Mario Bros	agent_1:That's awesome! I even remember the handheld console they released for Pokemon back in 2001. Those were so fun to have and play!
153369	agent_1:When students and parents visit college, the best way to do it for most is as an informal vacation type trip. agent_2:maybe, ive done that person. talking  to the advisers i feel is one of the most imporant as well agent_1:The best place for parents to do more intense college research is online, not forcing it into actual college visits.  It could embarass kids.	agent_2:agreed. kids need to be the ones seeing it as a vacation.the best time would be in april. So much fun times then
21024	agent_1:I was not either. I wish it would go away now because they are quite annoying ha ha. In contrast to animals, humans may have lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago.  agent_2:LOL, they certainly are annoying. That is very interesting and did you know that there is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans?  agent_1:I did not but I know that certain pitches (usually high ones) make me jumpy so I suppose that makes sense. Almost all animals and plants synthesize their own Vitamin C, but humans cannot because the gene for this enzyme is defective. I wonder why we did not evolve to have that ability as well?	agent_2:I was wondering that as well when I heard about that. It would be a lot healthier if we did have the ability to do so.  I have known some fast runners but I did not know humans were adapted for this for hunting reason. I hate hunting but I guess primitive man needed to do so.
95773	agent_2:Wouldn't it be great if it still was? I think it's also great that Winston Churchill won a Nobel Prize for literature instead of peace. That's quite an accomplishment! agent_1:Indeed it is. I wonder if he ever entered the annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening to a novel. Isn't that a strange competition?!  agent_2:That is! I bet a lot of the material is hilarious! Although I find it unbelievable that romantic kissing is a recent development seldom mentioned in ancient Greek literature!	agent_1:Indeed. Maybe writing about romantic kissing contributed to the growing distribution and proliferation of written works, culminating in electronic literature?
129514	agent_2:I gather since he coached the usa team he's pretty good then? agent_1:He's been successful, got the USA team to the last 16 rounds of the soccer world cup in 2010, by that stage you typically only have the best teams left in the contest. agent_2:That's really impressive!  Sounds like he knows how to coach to make players be their best, to get the best out of them.	agent_1:For the most part.  He got hired by a British team a few years back, Swansea City, but only lasted a few games before being terminated.  They didn't really give him a chance.
145467	agent_2:I didn't know that either. Soldiers carried metal-plated bibles in WWII. agent_1:Bulletproof bibles, nice. Did you know the Tower of Babel was likely the Etemenanki in modern-day Iraq? agent_2:I did not know that. Do you like television?	agent_1:Yea, I like watching the Simpsons, pretty amazing Bart has been in every episode but 1
66982	agent_2:I would have never thought of him doing that agent_1:Yes and that is how the trend of celebrities doing voices got going agent_2:I see. Do you know who is the most overrated celebrity?	agent_1:I am really tempted to say the Kardashians
63734	agent_1:I wonder how far in advance they plan the toys so they are out in time before the movie is released? agent_2:Sorry I hit the enter button by mistake, and I think they plan toy production even before a movie starts, its a million dollar industry so they must have an important input on the characters of a film. agent_1:I wonder if they ever have changes to the charatcher and it hurts the toy production line. I can't believe wreck it ralph was started in the late 80s.	agent_2:Wow I recently watched the movie, didnt realize the character is that old do you like computers?
147187	agent_1:I never knew that. I guess I don't know much about quarterbacks. I think they're kinda lead for offense, maybe? agent_2:I wonder if blocking assignments, receiver routes, etc. have to get changed up for a lefty. agent_1:I'm not sure. I do know the huddle was created by a deaf player to hid communications. That's pretty smart!	agent_2:I thought the huddle was just a basic part of the game. I wonder how a deaf QB fared in the game.
156229	agent_1:Yeah maybe so. most NFL players are regarded as celebrities these days. They get a lot of public attention. maybe too much. agent_2:I think there's to much emphasis on money. I'm not sure how much attention they would get without it? College ball now is important because of the pro game. Money distorts everything. agent_1:Yeah very true. And all the college players are complaining because they don't make a salary. Well just look at tv actors. Hugh Laurie earned 700,000 per episode in House. That is amazing.	agent_2:I understand the complaints by the college players. Everybody is making money except them. A few make it to the pros. Most of them struggle to finish the degree. Yes, I would rather be Hugh Laurie.
144463	agent_2:True.  They want to look professional.  I did not know that NBA is a men's professional league.  I thought it was often to female teams too. agent_1:Yeah, I think they have their own league.  Basketball players are some the highest paid people in the country even among athletes. agent_2:Wow, I did not know that.  I thought football players were the highest paid people.	agent_1:Even the basketball coaches are higher paid as well.  The inventor of Basketball was actually a coach for University of Kansas
38963	agent_2:I haven't watched that actually. I did hear that it was the first series debuted by Netflix. agent_1:It was a good show for sure. A little different, but I watched the first 2 seasons and it was enjoyable. I wonder what Netflix would have been like if blockbuster bought it agent_2:Yeah, I wonder. Blockbuster laughed them out of the office when Netflix proposed that Blockbuster use them as its online service.	agent_1:now look who is laughing now. Netflix started because of a 40 dollar late charge
1331	agent_2:Is that right! Well, good for George Lucas because this poor vision from 20 century made him a billionaire agent_1:It definitely did.  Do you know how much James Earl Jones was paid to record Darth Vader's lines? agent_2:I believe it was $7,500, and he just spent 2 hours and a half doing so	agent_1:Isnt that crazy?  Some of those lines are so iconic, and he got so little for them.  Shame.
30523	agent_1:I guess he needed the money. 10% of Nike. that is insane. he could have started his own country with that moneyLOL agent_2:Maybe $100,000 seemed like more back then, at least I hope, haha. agent_1:It was a lot and he might have worried about not getting anything, but 10% is a nice chunk. oh well.	agent_2:I wonder what kind of sponsorship Steph Curry has. It's surprising that he didn't get any college scholarship offers from a major conference school and wanted to play at Virginia Tech.
163422	agent_1:No who? Tom Brady as a 16 season starter has the most in history for 8 Superbowls!! agent_2:It is none other than Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. agent_1:Yay!! Very cool!! Isn't it interesting about how the circular huddle got started? Paul Hubbard a deaf quarterback.	agent_2:Wow!! That is quite surprising to say the least.
29639	agent_1:No, I think the solos are the best part, they give each performer the chance to spread their wings a bit in a sense.  agent_2:Yeah... definitely allows creative freedom! agent_1:Exactly, did you know that Clint Eastwood is a huge jazz fan? He even scored several of his films. 	agent_2:Oh really?  I did not like that!  I really like Clint Eastwood!  He's a great actor/director
47621	agent_2:I'm a casual fan. I tend to only follow football during the World Cup, how about you? agent_1:Sorry, I meant soccer, haha, got a little distracted. Well, I guess I would not be wrong in other parts of the world! We call it soccer because that's slang for association football. agent_2:I knew what you meant! Most of the world knows soccer as football. Do you follow any soccer?	agent_1:I don't really. Though I really should folow women's soccer more since the AMerican team has never placed below third since 1991.
23217	agent_1:I bet he did!  That would be fun to see an old video of him performing that role.  agent_2:Agreed. I'd also like to see the late Bruce Lee, who was a great dancer. So many activities, from martial arts to figure skating to marching bands can include dance-like movements or qualities. Athletics, of course, also inspires sometimes like dance movement. agent_1:I bet he was an excellent dancer, he could move around effortlessly it seemed.  And I agree, all types of athletics. 	agent_2:Take Tom Brady, Patriots long-time QB for example. Sometimes when he makes an accurate throw, his movement syncs with the ball, which flies magically right to a receiver, and the receiver's leap is just like a dance movement.
82864	agent_2:I'm not sure it would be understand quite the same today, despite its satire. But who knows? Eminem has more Academy Awards than Bill Murray, George Lucas, Johnny Depp, Will Smith, and Leonardio DiCaprio combined. agent_1:That seems really stupid to me. What do you think? I can't believe the Oscars were nominated for nine Emmys, how does that even work LOL agent_2:I mean, the guys I listed collectively haven't won that many Oscars, so that's how he has more, but they deserve more as a group! Haha, well, the Emmys is an award show for the best in television production, so technically, someone produces the Academy Awards for an episode of television, too!	agent_1:Haha well they get to double dip. I think it's interesting that Walt Disney has the record for most Oscars won by a man, 22!
156916	agent_2:Good afternoon, I follow enough to keep up with what's going on.  Lately, it's been very depressing. How about you? agent_1:About the same. Already sick of the 2020 elections.... agent_2:I agree, it's going to be a clown circus, again with the world watching.  I wonder how the Indonesian people felt when their president released those 3 Pop albums while president?	agent_1:Who knows?
14236	agent_1:I like auto biography and true crime mostly but if the writer is good, I will read fantasy, comedy and more! Did you know that William Shakespeare is considered the greatest writer in the English language? agent_2:I've read that he was so influential that many colloquialisms and turns of phrase we use today were popularized by his works. agent_1:Yes, did you also know that he invented the names, Jessica, Miranda and Olivia? I never knew that!	agent_2:I had no idea! I've read a few of his plays, but I'd love to see them acted out. Apparently a few theater companies, Faction of Fools and WSC Avant Bard, are planning on doing a few.
120090	agent_1:Yes, totally disloyal.  He just grew up so differently though so maybe that is why.  Tickets to his high school games used to go for $100-$120. agent_2:Sounds like he is very used to being made a big deal of and spoiled in a way.  It's as if he's been money motivated from the start. agent_1:He is the highest paid celebrity right now actually.  Crazy that second behind him is Judge Judy!!	agent_2:That is crazy.  I never would have thought she was that high paid!  Lebron though, he is money motivated. He rejected a ten million dollar offer from reebok when he was 18 because he figured he'd get more from nike.
65868	"agent_2:How true!  Did you know the Turkish national sport is oil wrestling?  Men douse themselves with olive oil and then wrestle. agent_1:Hmmm. I'll pass...  I'd rather see the cars in South Africa that ""legally"" are equipped with flame-throwers to prevent carjacking.  agent_2:I think I'll pass on that too.  Lol Now, maybe if their women did that, well that might be different. That's wild about the flamethrowers, must have a serious carjacking problem."	agent_1:For sure... I am happy that McDonald's created drive-thrus in 1975 to help out our soldiers.
102651	agent_2:Yes so popular they don't believe how it is a pastime here agent_1:Yeah. Do you watch much tv? agent_2:I watch it quite a bit actually. And you?	agent_1:Me too. Did you ever watch the Simpsons?
130735	agent_2:Nah, I was dragged to a Hanson concert by my sister many years ago. You? agent_1:Yeah I like them sometimes. Do you know the Ramones? agent_2:I have never listened to them. I do know that they toured almost nonstop for 20 years	agent_1:yeah and in that time they held 2263 concerts
149843	agent_2:Some teams are so dedicated, there was one team that continued to play their high school game as part of their campus burned behind them.  I guess that's dedication, or they didn't like school. agent_1:LOL!! they were concentrating so much on the game that they didn't care about the building.  now that is true dedication. or as you say, they just didn't care about the campus.  i don't know if that is funny or sad. agent_2:Both probably, even rock stars get in on the football action, did you know KISS bought an arean football team and tried to recruit Tim Tebow?	agent_1:i seem to remember that KISS did buy into an arena team but i had no idea they tried to recuit tebow.  somehow that mix confuses me...KISS and tim tebow? not exactly a logical match; at least on the surface.  tebow; now there is a guy with an interesting resume.
4556	agent_1:I  think practice is better, a well rested team might begin with some troubles, games are neccesary to adapt. agent_2:Yes, I would want people to practice. They need to prepare for the season. Did you know that baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if the need arises? agent_1:Ive always wondered about that, do you know if it ever happened in a game?	agent_2:I suppose back in the day one of the players was chosen to be manager. Handled both jobs. Now, not necessary.
92565	agent_2:One cannot live on nonfiction alone. Do you like poetry? agent_1:I  like Poetry, I like to go to the library and learn about poetry. agent_2:Have you read some terrible poetry? The kind that CS Lewis and Tolkien would have a 'you laugh, you lose' competition over?	agent_1:I have and find it really interesting, why?
116384	"agent_1:I cut the cable too and phone ( I use magicjack ) I just pay for the internet. I watched some episodes but I wasn't devoted fan. That's a lot of jobs ;) I don't remember him being rich tho ;) lol agent_2:I don't watch it either. I downloaded some new episodes of SNL from YouTube that were sometimes funny but my wife said the shows were stupid, not funny, and got mad whenever I watched it so I stopped. I love to read though. I like Stephen King, I heard he published over 58 novels. agent_1:I love Stephen King... ever since I've read ""The Stand"" I think he is a genius with beautiful imagination for creepy stuff ;) what's Your favorite book ?"	"agent_2:Actually I read ""The Stand"" in college and that is still my favorite to this day. I can't believe he got over 60 rejection notices before his first short story was published. Did you know before becoming a writer he was a high school English teacher?"
55220	agent_2:No prob. I am gonna pick up the new book by Reese Witherspoon. Have you heard about it? Its called Whiskey in a Teacup. agent_1:No I haven't, has she written other books before, or is this her first? agent_2:Although she is an actor, producer, and entrepreneur she is adding author to her resume now because this is her first book. I guess it's about the lifestyle guide to growing up in the south and she is peeling back the curtain to that lifestyle.	agent_1:Well that should be pretty interesting, I have always thought she was a great actress, and I think she is a hell of a mom too.
129626	agent_1:I think it would be really neat for it to be in one of the middle states. There seems to be quite the soccer following in the midwest. What would be your top picks? agent_2:I thought a major city that is warm, maybe Miami. I think its so interesting that the next city to host does not exist yet. agent_1:I wonder if they wait to determine it until they know what countries are doing well each year. That way they can give it to the country that will bring in the greatest revenue. 	agent_2:Perhaps, maybe the are building a new city. It is a shame that the United States has not placed in so many years.
133445	agent_1:Do you follow celebrities?  agent_2:I watch some of their movies or tv shows. Lol. I especially like John cena agent_1:He is a great star, on the rise, I used to like Robin Williams a lot, he sure left a big legacy behind him. 	agent_2:Yes he did. Did you know that John cena holds the record for most make a wishs granted?
63620	agent_1:Those are tough puzzles! I have never seen an episode of Game of Thrones and I think I am the only person on the planet that hasn't haha....I hear it is based off of a set of fantasy novels? agent_2:It is.  It is filmed in several locations around the world.  It is pretty complicated itself.  There are 7 kingdoms involved. agent_1:I have heard my friends rant and rave about it, I believ it came out in 2011?	"agent_2:Several of the ""heroes"" died in previous seasons.  There are 8 episodes left to be shown (I think) Maybe some day you can binge watch it."
70669	agent_1:A little bit about Iphones. I know they have a crazy amount of computing power! agent_2:They have tons of computing power. More than the entire US nuclear ICBM deterrent system which is scary. agent_1:So scary! I need to do the UNICEF challenge where they donate clean water to kids for every minute you're not on your cellphone!	agent_2:That's very awesome they do that. Good for them.
92581	agent_2:I only knew that because of the article haha. agent_1:Me as well! I didnt know that jordans were banned. did you  agent_2:No, and that's pretty incredible. He had enough money to not even care.	agent_1:Yeah it must be great! I bet allen iverson is making a lot money off of rebok
10825	agent_2:That was a different time, generating those frames took so long that it made sense to recycle those that you could. Creation is a much quicker process now with the aid of computer programs. agent_1:Did you know that Frozen was the first animated Disney film directed by a woman. agent_2:Yes I had heard that. Disney does a good job trying to increase representation in their films and parks when possible. They also dubbed the Lion King into Zulu for its African release.	agent_1:Makes sense i wasnt at all surprised when Disney acquired Marvel.
61381	"agent_2:Not much more about that, but I do know that Demetri Martin once wrote a 224 word palindrome poem. agent_1:Wow, that's crazy! Like Linkin Park's ""Hybrid Theory"" is the best-selling album of the 21st century. agent_2:I like Linkin Park.  They are named after a park in Baltimore."	agent_1:Really? I had no clue. I like listening to them at the gym.
40371	agent_2:I dont read much. I remember my grandfather telling  me how he used to play monopoly during the war to relax. agent_1:Oh, that's cool.  Well, I will leave you with this. There was a moral panic  in the 18th century because of the spread of reading novels. agent_2:Can you read Braille?	agent_1:no, have a great day.
80480	agent_1:yeah it does, more than the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent agent_2:That's crazy that intercontinental ballistic missles are being controlled by something less than an iphone. agent_1:there you go, the phones are so advanced now it is crazy	agent_2:Do you like harry potter.
135964	agent_1:I hear you.  I forgot about Paula Abdul... Don't get me started on taxes... Sales tax is crazy where I'm at.  In places it's almost 10%... agent_2:I'm kind of a fan of abolishing The IRS and instituting a national flat sales tax. There is no such thing as blue collar workers anymore - Merely those who eat on their own dime and those who do not. It's scary.  agent_1:Yep.  Death and taxes... I've been a fan of a flat tax for years.  All American need to have skin in the game.  We have too many people that don't and only vote for people that keep them funded. 	agent_2:Super stoked to hear this reiterated in someone presumably much younger than me - I don't possess the time, energy or effort anymore to call a spade a spade and am staring down the barrel of late life, so please accept my sincere apologies on behalf of my generation for what we were too busy working to pay the bills to take up and tackle. In the interim, let's be grateful it's still legal to drive a car on our highways. 10/10 recommend the movie Somewhere In Time which was filmed there with Christopher Reeve.
56715	agent_1:That's an interesting fact.  Nice.  If you publish a book in Norway, the gov't will buy 1000 copies of your book and distribute them to libraries throughout the country.  That's interesting if you're an author from there.   agent_2:I'm sure that encourages more authors to publish, knowing that copies of your books will end up all over the country!  What is your favorite kind of literature? agent_1:I'm a fan of non-fiction.  I always wanted to try writing someday and maybe I could win a contest like that annual one they have where writers have to come up with the worst opening sentence to a novel.  lol	"agent_2:LOL!  What?  I never heard of that!  Now I'm curious...  Maybe you should try comedic fantasy?  An author was once knighted for his ""services to literature"" through comedic fantasy!"
43991	agent_2:Yes I am a fan of the Spurs.  The NBA has the worlds best paid athletes.   agent_1:Nice. Yeah although I wouldn't complain, they still make a pretty penny. Hard to believe it's been around since 1946! agent_2:Yes it merged with the National Basketball Association in 1949.	agent_1:Oh interesting. Some players make a lot. Iverson is going to receive 32 million at age 55 from Reebok!
64583	agent_1:Right, that's what I think! So much has changed in what society finds acceptable. For example, the Romans thought wearing pants was a sign of barbarism. agent_2:They'd love the trend of people sagging their pants nowadays then. They'd probably see it as barbarism on top of barbarism, haha. agent_1:Haha. Would they like MC Hammer's pants? By the way, Aladdin's pants were modeled after those.	agent_2:I think they'd like the law in Collinsville, Illinois against saggy pants a lot more!
70718	agent_2:And that the sun produces enough energy in one second to sustain the needs of the entire planet for half a billion years! How powerful agent_1:I can believe that.  The earth is a little speck 93 million miles away and the sun radiates in every direction.  And the earth still receives a lot of energy. agent_2:It sure does. It is 109 times bigger than Earth.	agent_1:And its mass is 99.86 percent of the solar system.  It's almost everything.
78501	agent_2:Well, just to let you know it's a holdover from early evolution when land animals had both lungs, as well as gills.  Modern animals are clearly established in the fossil records as marine species.   agent_1:Oh wow, that is interesting and cool.  So crazy how things evolve over time.  agent_2:Do you know the Loch Ness monster is a protected species?	agent_1:What that is hilarious!  I think there is no monster, just a Greenland shark that swam into the lock and further up river is what caused all the theories.
163900	agent_2:Wonder if an audiobook is considered an an album. If so the audio version of the Art of the Deal would be his. Don't think any other sitting presidents have albums. agent_1:None come to mind at the moment. Presidents have different functions though depending on the form of government so that president may have a lighter role than others. agent_2:I was surprised that five US presidents have been elected while still losing the popular vote. The greatest margin was 10%.	agent_1:Even more surprising is that the runner up used to become the vice president.
82584	agent_1:no, I haven't! But this boys mom kept looking and did find one, she got it on Ebay on the computer! Love it! agent_2:Yeah, she got it for $4 and was shocked that she was the only bidder lmao  agent_1:Haha, even though she was outbid by 1 dollar at first she still got it! The man who sent him that plane is an amazing person.	agent_2:Oh yeah, missed that part. I wonder how that guy Abe knew to contact Noah's mom?
34413	"agent_1:Yeah... What's the best show you've been to? agent_2:I have been to some very interesting ""underground"" acts that combine poetry, dance, primal instincts as well as being erotic. Its fun how instinctively we can feel involved and feel the movement! agent_1:where are you from where you would have seen these? "	agent_2:The city... I have also seen many Cirque De Solei shows and those box office tickets start at 70$! They have a lot of pressure and they certainly do perform amazingly! It is dice to see new young artists exploring their talents though.. especially for 17$
128433	agent_2:whoever bought it though? did they bring a tow truck ? lol agent_1:It makes you wonder, it certainly wouldn't be easy to move haha agent_2:unless they wanted to  make the tourism money from where it is	agent_1:Possibly, but then they would have to rent the land. Or maybe it came with the deal, haha. I wonder if it was another government that bought it.
98757	agent_2:Hello. I like watching drama, but I like horror better. What about you? agent_1:I like to watch mostly comedy and drama as I am not one to pay to have something or someone scare the wits out of me. LOL  I have heard though that by watching horror over and other one can burn more calories, maybe I should give it a shot. agent_2:That's a good way to burn calories lol. Christopher Nolan meant for Inception to be a horror film and it ended up being a heist film.	agent_1:Well that is interesting. Just like Danny; the boy from the movie shining, he did not know he was acting in a horror film until years later.
87891	agent_1:Hi, do you watch a lot of youtube? agent_2:I do. But I use Facebook more. You? agent_1:I'm surprised since half of peak internet traffic is youtube and Netflix. I watch all the time. Don't even need cable anymore.	agent_2:I use Alpha Browser instead.  That way I'm compensated for watching commercials.
125167	agent_2:He wasn't a jazz fan either, lol agent_1:No he wasn't lol agent_2:Do you know where to find the site to participate in Unicef's clean water program?	agent_1:I don't but wish I could because I would love to give a child a day of clean water in exchange for every minute I'm not on my cell phone.
22315	agent_1:Wow, really? I guess all athletes are physically sound. Do they really flood basketball courts in order to play ice hockey? agent_2:That what I heard, I think Canada has one of the best team. I wonder how they flood basketball courts? agent_1:Don't know, but I hear that is true. I think Canada played in the first winter Olympics. It is one of their national sports along with lacrosse, which I know nothing about,	agent_2:I like watching hockey on TV, but I wonder about all the hitting they take, it's a rough sport.
90327	agent_2:Yeah that sure does not. DId you know women were not allowed to wear pants in the senate until 1993? agent_1:Really? That is nonsense. ROmans saw pants as a sign of barbarism agent_2:Wow cool. Did you know HUlk has indestructible pants?	agent_1:Haha that only makes sense. DO you know much about presidents?
120775	agent_1:Nope. I think I'd rather listen to the 100 year old identical twins who released a rap album in Japan agent_2:What did they rap about, do you know?  agent_1:I have no idea, maybe gangsta rap since the twins released it in 1992	agent_2:Did you know that babies dance when they hear music?
57940	agent_2:That is an interesting fact, I wonder what type of characters he would have created had he gone into that field.  agent_1:His favorite superhero was spider-man. Probably something along those lines, maybe? agent_2:Yeah I think that is a safe bet, I think he would have come up with some really cool villains though. 	"agent_1:I'd like to see Eminem do like the Korean rappers that invented a new type of freestyle, it's called ""compliment battle""."
117567	agent_1:The scary part for me is the interference by foreign governments in our elections. I think that's tantamount to an act of war. agent_2:Thats what it says here. These voluntary efforts are failing to curtail the spread of disinformation, and sooner or later the tech industry will have to face the same FCC restrictions on content and advertising as traditional media - which would undoubtedly help to reduce the spread of erroneous reporting. Second, the messenger matters. agent_1:I agree. When you see something on a trusted internet source, you tend to believe it. Nowadays it's getting hard to know who to belielve.	agent_2:Research shows that even truthful information will be dismissed by audiences if it doesn't come from a trusted source.
27855	agent_1:Hello - how are you doing today? agent_2:I am good. Are you interested in celebrities? agent_1:Hello - I don't follow them too closely. What about you?	agent_2:Depends. I heard that pixar studio has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities!
128646	agent_1:I wonder what the aggressive mode on Google's car actually does. I can't imagine it doing much going all of 3 miles an hour. Maybe it aggressively honks at people. agent_2:It probably just goes faster. Or it doesn't wait to warm up. agent_1:I wonder how it would handle a drive through. Just think. McDonald's originally made a drive through because of the military. Soldiers weren't allowed to leave their cars wearing their fatigues.	agent_2:Interesting. Now I'm fatigued and must get something to eat. Nice chatting with you.
146168	agent_2:The Vice President was elected a lot differently, they were the second highest vote for the Presidential race. agent_1:Well I think that is interesting, but I wouldn't want both trump and hillary to be in the highest elected positions of power agent_2:Do you know who the richest three American Presidents have been?	agent_1:I think Washington was one.
108237	agent_2:I didn't know that. I wonder what that is about. When I was little my parents and I all enjoyed the Simpsons together. I also liked Pokemon. They didn't like that that much. agent_1:My kids like Pokemon. There are over 750 episodes. I wonder how many I've seen? agent_2:Yeah that's 50 a year for 16 years straight. Now my kids watch it as well.	agent_1:Oh, no way I'd be able to sit through that many episodes. Of course, with You Tube I'm sure all the episodes are out there.
90851	agent_1:Isn't that crazy?  Are you a car fan? agent_2:I am definitely a gear head. I wish I was as Lucky as a man in New York who purchased some property and found a barn full of classic cars agent_1:Wouldn't that be awesome?  How about Jann Mardenborough who became a professional race car driver by beating 90,000 people in the Gran Turismo video game!	agent_2:That pretty cool. I use to play that game when I was younger
40546	agent_1:Some people just can't deal with high school. Probably didn't see himself as college material. I know that Demetri Martin left Harvard Law to pursue comedy. agent_2:Hmm that is interesting, I haven't heard of him have you seen any movies that he's been in? agent_1:No, I haven't. I guess law school makes people think carefully about their life choices and what they really want to do with themselves. 	agent_2:Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer? it makes sense because martial arts is basically like a dance that you practice
164071	agent_1:Yes,  My dog is loveable - she has even donated blood - she has a rarer type of the 12 different types dogs have. agent_2:Oh, thats really amazing. I didn't know dogs could donate blood.  agent_1:Yes they can!  Other dogs need it after surgeries as well!  I like how Istanbul treats their animals  - it even has vending machine for stray dogs	agent_2:There are some dog parks here in America that are starting to do it too. But I have heard many areas in Turkey treat stray cats and dogs wonderfully. They are part of their community.
19910	agent_1:Maybe we have different experiences? I really don't enjoy small talk, so I cringed imagining myself on the date. Tell me more about what you found interesting? agent_2:I like the concept of going on a blind date - it definitely sounds like a better plan than Tinder where everyone is judged just by looks. agent_1:Yes, Tinder sounds awful! I'm really glad I never experienced that. Have you ever been in a situation like in the story where you had to make conversation about something you didn't know enough about to make good conversation? It happened to me in a really spectacular way with a work networking situation and football.	agent_2:I have not really.  I just usually remain quiet and ask questions if I do not know about the topic.
37767	agent_2:Yeah. DO you know who Reggie Miller is? agent_1:He is a good player but his sister was always better than him agent_2:Yeah the once broke 8 national records when she scored 105 points in a single game	agent_1:Yeah impressive, so much talent in a single family though
159207	agent_1:That is a good point.  Did you use to watch cartoons on Saturday mornings growing up? agent_2:I did! Pokemon was one of them. There are now over 750 episodes agent_1:That is just crazy how many episodes of that show they have made, wow. 	agent_2:If you watched 50 a year. It would take 16 years
10094	agent_1:I do, mostly non fiction books, there are also great books about trees, they might sound boring but they can be really interesting agent_2:I don't know if I could ever just read about about trees. I could read a book that was more about the Earth as a whole. The cosmos are fascinating. agent_1:I agree, the cosmos is fascinating and earth is too, so many planets out there, all the wonders they hold	agent_2:I like to think about everything we don't know. Like astronomers possibly detecting building blocks for life in a planetary system 455 light-years away.
11177	agent_2:Somewhat, Never know what to believe. agent_1:Yeah, I hear McConnell is out to destroy his reputation, or whatever is left of it. agent_2:Really, Did you know since the 1900's in elections the taller person usually won 75% of the time!	agent_1:I heard that.  We gotta start looking for some tall people to run in 2020
89732	agent_1:No I wish I did though! How long have you played for? agent_2:I am a novice, that dreams of some day playing more than just chopsticks. But there is something about striking those keys, moving those levers, and hearing the notes ring that warms the soul. agent_1:It really does sound amazing and soothing at the same time! I wonder if Freddie Mercury felt the same as Paul McCartney while playing the same piano?	agent_2:You could write a movie about that piano!
27484	agent_1:ya they have like 140 million subs and 60 million in the usa alone, thats nuts! agent_2:The money must roll in! China won't ever get Netflix. They'll try to come up with their own version. They don't like outside interference. agent_1:ya I think you're right, but at least they probably wont do the dvd mail thing, that costs 20x more than internet bandwidth	agent_2:I guess some people don't have Internet access or don't know how to use computers. They need DVDs mailed.
74802	agent_2:A little.  I read somewhere that a Finnish radio station broadcasts a weekly news program entirely in classical Latin. agent_1:yeah and I really wonder how many listeners they have agent_2:Probably not too many, I would think.Lol	agent_1:yeah I think so too. do you know much about politics?
124173	agent_1:That's interesting, I always thought of him more as drama than horror, maybe I was wrong! agent_2:Then again I really didn't pay attention in school, so I don't really remember. I guess you could look at it as drama, and horror. And interesting how Aristotle was the one who had one of the earliest pieces in drama history.  agent_1:I guess all these genres started earlier than we thought! And you fast forward today, and Hugh Laurie earns 700k per episode of House.	agent_2:Yes, it is amazing, how much money can be earned from acting, too bad they have to spend most of it, for their career.
44629	agent_2:I do, I still have several. I have Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon and it's amazing. How about you?  agent_1:Dark Side of the Moon! I have that one, too! Did you know that it was one of the best selling albums of 2014? agent_2:I did. NWA has had a great album. Anyway, it's been a fun chat!	agent_1:Oh yeah! Straight Outta Compton was the first album to reach platinum status without airplay or a tour. I'm gonna go throw it on the record player now. Have a good night!
110919	agent_2:I like Criminal Minds, and watching MMA with my kids.  They like video games.  I wonder what they would have thought about the original NES that could only display 54 colors. agent_1:Criminal minds is awesome its very in dept and it's alot more fun then CSI. They would probably still appreciate the innovation of the NES agent_2:Maybe so, but Nintedo discontinued in in 2003.	agent_1:But didn't you know they brought it back smaller and loaded with all the games? Its only 60$ and its called the NES CLASSIC
116908	agent_1:I agree but Mike Pence seems like a worse alternative. I don't think either one has our country's best interest in mind  agent_2:True and I think he has already planned for this. Thats why he has been so quiet agent_1:An interesting fact about the US president, until the year 1805 the runner up would become vice president, 	agent_2:I think that would of been pure chaos in 2016! Would be quite entertaining though
3082	agent_1:Wow must have been really bad then. DO you ever shop at target? agent_2:Yes quite a bit. They will match Amazon prices so it makes it a good place to shop agent_1:Nice I did not know that. There is no Target in Vermont though	agent_2:SO I guess they have to stick with Amazon. And they do not carry tobacco products since 19
89863	agent_2:That did not sound fair.  The regular Bieber was older and came to this world before the famous Bieber. agent_1:That's just not fair at all.  agent_2:Apparently, Lebron James rejected $10m offer from Reebok when he was just 18.	agent_1:Oh wow, it's a good thing he did though, he signed a massive lifetime deal with Nike.
18509	agent_2:Yes! And gravity 1/16 as strong as Earth's. agent_1:There's a famous heart shaped basin on Pluto as well and it has surface ripples which means there's wind on Pluto! agent_2:Yes, and the dunes may be made of methane grains. It's a completely different environment, with temperatures as low as -380 F.	agent_1:But still somewhat Earth like!  Jagged mountains, dunes, a lake basin, wind . . .  Just so darn far from the sun.
105604	agent_2:Yes I agree. They're definitely the most interesting ones. Have you ever seen the show That 70s Show? I guess they tried to remake it for that England market and it definitely flopped haha. agent_1:I used to love that show and remakes tend to be really bad, I heard it had a lame name '' Days like these'' terrible name agent_2:That is a terrible name. And they canceled it after only 10 episodes, I wonder if anyone in the UK was super into it but then it was canceled afterwards LOL that would be a bummer	agent_1:That would be a bummer lol, they can always watch the original show,
76155	"agent_2:At times. I think it's hilarious that the court on the Supreme Court building is called ""the highest court in the land"". I wonder how often staffers play/ agent_1:It does not seem like a group of people that would be very athletic.  agent_2:The justices, no. But they have a huge staff that would enjoy it. It's interesting that the inventor of basketball was a losing coach."	agent_1:I did not know that. How ironic.
5917	agent_2:I sure do. Do you know what she sings if you ask her to? agent_1:Yes she sings the same song as hal 9000 of space oddysey agent_2:Yes. Do you know where siri sends the questions that we ask?	agent_1:Yes to a database in North Carolina, pretty scary
144018	agent_2:I can't imagine they are acturally comprehending, I believe it was Anne Jones who did that, amazing that people once panicked because reading novels became a common thing to do. agent_1:Yes another interesting fact I learned recently was that google maps calculates traffic by tracking how fast android devices are moving on the roadways. agent_2:That is interesting, did you know google makes it maps so the borders show up how each country claims they are	agent_1:No Thats interesting too. I bet the average adult could learn a lot just from google maps lol
45879	agent_2:He makes bank. does he have anything left to prove? i guess people always will compare him to MJ. agent_1:I think Michael Jordan was better, at least I like him more, Im excited about the Space Jam movie,  agent_2:I figure lebron cant be a worse actor than MJ. i wonder who else is in the film. bill murray?	agent_1:I guess lots of great actors from the original movie will return and yeah MJ isnt the best actor I agree with you there.
21056	agent_1:you're right maybe that was it. did you know imbd was owned by amazon? agent_2:I did see that and didn't realize that. agent_1:i didn't realize that either. it is also hard to believe the company is just 15 years old!	agent_2:The first amazon.com customer spent $27.95 and got a building named after him
20494	agent_2:That's really cool. One thing I don't get is why Coach Stan Van Gundy was fined. All he said was that he didn't think they should play games on Christmas agent_1:Yes that did sound strange, I didn't know the reason for his comment, did you know the reason for that comment? agent_2:Not sure. I guess it's one of those things we'll never know. One thing I do know is that Just Bieber has the most disliked video on YouTube	agent_1:It doesn't surprise me too much, such a young guy when he started, but lived as an adult.
53785	agent_2:I did, I loved that series kind of dark but great. Did you watch 13 Reasons Why agent_1:I did, I couldn't finish the first season, it seemed to almost glorify suicide and what not. I'm not sure if it was the best message for people. Netflix has some great shows though. agent_2:Its really dark, not a show for everyone but it gets interesting later on and then kind of addictive and really sad.	agent_1:For sure, that makes sense. Netflix and Youtube make up half of the peak of internet traffic, I could see a lot of people getting addicted to it.
92593	agent_2:dwayne wade seems like a very nice guy. agent_1:I agree! His comments to the Sentinel were great!  agent_2:yes. it was a nice thing to say	agent_1:Have a great day!
11098	agent_2:That is true.  Maybe they did it right in ancient athens, where leaders were appointed by lottery. agent_1:I had no idea that GOP stood for Grand Old Party. Seems like a really old white thing... agent_2:Well, every president with a beard was Republican, so who knows!	agent_1:Truman refused to go on the dumbo ride for fear of being pictured on a elephant...
119529	agent_1:Do you follow American politics? agent_2:Some,  I am not surprised that the first phone number in the white house was 1. lol agent_1:It definitely helped people reach the White House the fastest. I am surprised they still use floppy disks for storage.	agent_2:Yes, I know.. I was surprised with that. I didn't know there was a replica of the white house in Atlanta thats a private home.
163163	agent_2:Yes, me neither.  It came as a surprise to me when I learned that Trump wasn't one of the three wealthiest presidents in American history! agent_1:I believe Trump makes claims. When its tax time he claims poor.  When needing a loan or investors he claims wealth.  I would rather listen to a list of George Washington's assets. agent_2:I agree that he does do that.  Did you know that the president's guest house is larger than the White House?	agent_1:I thing that makes sense.  The white house has thick walls, and it was built long ago.  I wonder what the other wealthy presidents listed on their taxes.  JFK and Jefferson.
140375	agent_1:Did you know that soccer makes more money than football, basketball, baseball, golf, tennis and hockey combined? agent_2:I didnt know that but I guess it makes sense, soccer is a really popular sport played in over 200 countries and with 250 million players agent_1:I would have never guessed. Jon Stewart was a skilled soccer player in college. Is he that comedian?	agent_2:Yeah the one from the Daily Show I think I wonder if he ever played the variation of the game with 3 teams.
20003	agent_1:yeah he is talented. Tupac was a talented rapper, his music is in the library of Congress of Cultural Significance  agent_2:He was a pretty significant rapper. Did you know pilgrims only wore black on special occasions? agent_1:really that's cool, Also Apple had a clothing line in 1986.	agent_2:I bet it was really minimalist and expensive!
4659	agent_2:I would actually say I am a bigger soccer fan than Baseball.  Especially when it comes to world cups. agent_1:Yeah I don't really like either game haha. It is crazy though that the World Series actually started back in 1903, so I do respect its long history. agent_2:The cubs won the first back to back series and then didnt win again until 2016.  That is a long time.	agent_1:Yeah that is a long time, and apparently the Ottoman Empire was still a thing back when they first one at haha
66839	agent_2:I have no idea. Who is it? agent_1:Surprisingly it's Tom Hanks with over 8.5 billion world wide earnings.  agent_2:He is a really good actor! I'm not surprised. Love box office hits. I know Disney considered shutting down their animation studio after Sleeping Beauty was a box office failure.	agent_1:And then they brought it back again and again and again, well you get the point. Have you ever seen Silence of the Lambs?
108406	agent_2:I love TV. Maybe too much. What about you? Do you like tv? agent_1:I do, I think it is great. Did you know there are 750 episodes of Pokemon?  agent_2:I think my son has watched almost all of them. And I have also picked up that many of his pokemon cards...	agent_1:I haven't seen any of the Pokemon, but I did play Pokemon Go for a bit.
156699	agent_2:Yeah. Do you use facebook? agent_1:I do actually. Do you know why it is blue? agent_2:I think it is because Mark if green-red colorblind	agent_1:Yesh. The like button is illegal in parts of germany
56713	agent_1:That's what went through my head when I read that.  Every library should follow their lead and do that.   agent_2:I agree...and maybe people would read more books too.  I guess when libraries started lending video games, to attract teenagers in, books started getting checked out at a much larger rate than before! agent_1:That's an interesting fact.  Nice.  If you publish a book in Norway, the gov't will buy 1000 copies of your book and distribute them to libraries throughout the country.  That's interesting if you're an author from there.  	agent_2:I'm sure that encourages more authors to publish, knowing that copies of your books will end up all over the country!  What is your favorite kind of literature?
138421	agent_1:There really is especially when it comes to shoes! agent_2:Michael even has a patent on a device he developed to allow for his extreme lean. agent_1:When I first found that out it was like finding out Santa Claus isnt real!	agent_2:Back to ballet, I wonder how many shoes Tupac went through?    Professionals can use 4 pairs in any given week!
147739	agent_1:That must've been a surprise. I'm guessing it was part of an estate being sold off and the seller wasn't aware of the contents? agent_2:Yes, I do wonder how the barn could just be left behind like that. It's sad to think that we made cars faster and more efficient but these days there are many more accidents than there were when cars were first invented. agent_1:Yeah, cars have a lot more engine capacity mainly just for a tiny fraction of driving time, to accelerate around other cars. People abuse that extra power.	agent_2:Some people aren't so lucky to have a hero like Burch, or sometimes there isn't even a chance since they die instantly.
94978	agent_2:Yes about 180 more than a regular movie, not bad agent_1:Yeah . Do you know how they make those creepy noises in them? agent_2:Yes they use an instrument called a waterphone	agent_1:Yes it sounds scary just the name of it, let alone its functions
42193	agent_2:I dont think so, and cool that you are a programmer, I didnt know you could do that with programming language! thats awesome! Im in Kansas City and have yet to visit all the Jazz places around here, maybe this summer. and I wonder how her neighbors feel especially the ones next door lol, although I personally would love it. agent_1:Haha that's a good question. I'll have to listen to some jazz music though, and check out this new Pakistani Jazz Orchestra, they're apparently topping all of the charts agent_2:oh, for sure! Me too, it's quite relaxing. Its hard to believe Jazz was barely introduced in the late 19th Century, I wonder how crazy people went when they first heard it. It makes my heart flutter.	agent_1:Haha yeah jazz is great, I also didn't know that trumpeters would grow goatees because it made playing the trumpet more comfortable, maybe I'll have to grow one if I ever take up the trumpet
156232	agent_2:I understand the complaints by the college players. Everybody is making money except them. A few make it to the pros. Most of them struggle to finish the degree. Yes, I would rather be Hugh Laurie. agent_1:Yeah Hugh Laurie has got it made. Some actors do it for other reasons. Like Michael Caine who became an actor because all the prettiest girls were in drama class...smart man! agent_2:Smart man, indeed. No reason to hide your motivations. The girls are there, so he went there. It's as good a reason as any.	agent_1:A lot of people are drawn to celebrities in my opinion. Maybe just to get access to the secret room for celebrities in Pixar Studios!
3647	agent_1:I did too and people rate them on a 1-5 scale. Do you think people care about their date's shoes? agent_2:I think women tend to care more about the shoes then men, men tend to only care more about function than style agent_1:Did you know that professional ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week? I hope they're not too expensive!	agent_2:That's insane. I just learned they have Wizard of Oz inspired shoes that can guide you home when you click you heels
41849	agent_2:Not really... who are they? agent_1:They are an NBA team,  from California.  Anyways,  they have a player named Stephen Curry,  he is the 5th highest paid player on their team!  agent_2:The fifth... so he doesn't get paid that much? LOL	agent_1:lol Im sure its still a lot.  He has been MVP a few times.  He grew up in the same town as Lebron James.
150425	agent_2:It just doesnt make sense to have a ventriloquist act on the radio lol, seems a bit absurd to me agent_1:They probably thought as long as we see the puppets the listeners can use their imagination agent_2:Sorry I just dont see the logic behind that, do you know who Bill Murray is?	agent_1:Yes he is a legend he was hilarious in both zombieland and in ghostbusters whats your favorite film he has acted in?
42744	agent_2:Everyday! I guess anyone who is 13 can use it too agent_1:That seems really young! I didn't realize it has been around since 2004, that's 15 years already! agent_2:Thats a long time. It's valued at 104 billion!	agent_1:Incredible. Myspace could have bought it for $75 million but they turned down the offer!
106664	agent_1:That's pretty interesting. Did you know that in 2006, the US passed legislation that would protect government employees from being prosecuted for violating the Geneva Conventions? agent_2:Good governments have a balance between tyranny and freedom so that is good. agent_1:Yeah I guess it is. Have you heard about the man in France who impersonated a government official and managed to sell the Eiffel Tower twice?	agent_2:I like the norweigian government who donated a billion to save the rainforest
90249	agent_1:Yeah they are good. Do you know why the trumpeters grow goatees? agent_2:yes because it is more comfortable to play agent_1:Yeah. Do you like the piano?	agent_2:I sure do. Once BBC played the piano instead of the news
159595	agent_2:I don't watch Tv often so I wouldnt know. agent_1:It is OK, you don't have to watch everything, most people don't that's why Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 shows since 1989.  agent_2:Hahaha! thats very funny! hahahahahaaha!!	agent_1:It is thought to be funny, and tougher to stay funny. 3rd Rock from the Sun won the Golden Globe for best comedy, beating Friends and Seinfeld, and no one is talking about it now.
121276	agent_1:I think there's a reason that changed, because the loser and the winner generally are not on the same page. Hillary would've constantly been at odds with Trump's decisions and views. agent_2:Yeah. You're probably right! Though it would be interesting to see but probably disasterous. Well, if you are the president of Indonesia, you would have time to release 3 pop albums while in office, ha. agent_1:Well, maybe Kanye can be president and make 3 rap albums while in office. Then he might have second thoughts about glorifying white power and really stand up for his people using both of his platforms.	agent_2:Oh, I can totally imagine him loving being president. Well, voting is important in any case, though I was not happy with the results of the last election. The Indian government sets up a polling booth in a lion filled forest for just one person.
105334	agent_2:I did know that. I watch that episode and it was awesome! If you ever watched the show Thomas the Tank Engine? agent_1:I feel like I caught bits and pieces on PBS when I was a little kid. I remember Ringo Starr being the narrator, but apparently George Carlin and Alec Baldwin have also narrated at least 52 episodes each. agent_2:Yeah you're right. I want to listen to George Carlin he's so funny! Have you ever seen the show That 70s Show by the way?	agent_1:I
67887	agent_2:I'm sure that would be cool to hear! There is also a radio station that translates solar activity and you can hear the sun! agent_1:wow that sounds cool, do you know how to make a foxhole radio btw? I want to learn how to make one agent_2:I've never heard of one! I wish I could hear Bill Murray voicing the human torch in the 1970's fantastic four radio show!	agent_1:wow that sounds cool I love Bill! Yes a foxhole radio is made from a razorblade and a pencil, they used them in WWII but I don't know how exactly they're put together
157984	agent_2:I have never heard of them, I will have to check them out sometimes.  Do they ever do shows on the radio? agent_1:No, He was not do the radio shows. agent_2:That's too bad, I wonder what a radio cooking show would sound like anyways. 	agent_1:Do you know the great wall in china.?
35753	agent_2:I live in the upper midwest and wouldnt mind a stable climate! Which planet is your favorite? agent_1:Haha well I like planet Earth. But I also like the planet where it rains glass LOL that seems pretty cool although I wouldn't like to visit it myself, what about you? agent_2:I would say Uranus, the view with a sideways orbit might be interesting.	agent_1:Haha yes I could see that, the name always makes me laugh LOL. I wish we could visit the planet that they think life exists on, the only problem is it's 455 light years away
78713	agent_2:No I never knew that agent_1:Have you ever worn a pair of Air Jordans? I know they're expensive but they seem like they might be worth it agent_2:Yes I have one pair from like the 90's that I dont wear anymmore lol Did you ever wear any?	agent_1:I've never worn it actually haha. How comfortable were they? I know that the NBA had banned them for a while
163594	agent_2:Of course. It is just kind of weird. I did not know Bieber was canadian. Do you subscribe to radio or do you just listen to free radio? agent_1:No not really, do you know any free radio websites? agent_2:I know pandora has a free version.	agent_1:I might download it, you know that Jupiter has storms that are so strong AM radio picks them up!
3692	agent_2:Writing poetry is definitely an art. For instance, there is poem that when read normally is depressing, yet backwards it is inspiring. Perhaps embodying the silver lining to a negative situation. agent_1:Wow i would like to read that one. There is an alphabet that when recited in order forms a poem. I for get which one. agent_2:To this day poetry influenced our perceptions. For instance, all the hobbit's character names are derived from the poem dvergatal	agent_1:Now that i did not know. Do you like dogs?
163377	agent_2:maybe we'll see a female kicker. agent_1:I was thinking kicker as well and that's probably about it. Did you know the average NFL game is only 11 minutes of live gameplay? agent_2:It seems like more than that.	agent_1:I would think so too, but maybe not with all of the huddles and time in between plays.
134712	agent_1:I used to watch it. Did you know they remade That 70s show in the UK?  agent_2:I did not know that, I wonder how successful it was agent_1:It was canceled after 10 episodes. 	agent_2:Wow, so not good at all! That is kind of like that 80s show
155741	agent_2:Yeah I don't know why they would do that in Finland haha. What do you think about the website that has thousands of classic radio dramas you can listen to online? Have you tried that agent_1:I have not although I should try that out. The author of game of thrones called the new england patriots the lannisters of the NFL. I wonder why agent_2:Well if you've ever seen the show, you would know that the Lannisters are the bad guys so I take it he does not like the Patriots LOL	agent_1:I agree. The Patriots's headquarters is at Gillette Stadium. The names of these stadiums clearly need work!
159596	agent_1:It is OK, you don't have to watch everything, most people don't that's why Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 shows since 1989.  agent_2:Hahaha! thats very funny! hahahahahaaha!! agent_1:It is thought to be funny, and tougher to stay funny. 3rd Rock from the Sun won the Golden Globe for best comedy, beating Friends and Seinfeld, and no one is talking about it now.	agent_2:Hahahahaha!!!! very funny!
33928	agent_1:moving wild audiences are associated with Classical Music agent_2:That's awesome. There's a man named Arthur Lintgen who can analyze the grooves on a vinyl record and correctly identify a piece of classical music. agent_1:In 2011  a written piece of contemporaneity classical music was written by a computer also	agent_2:That's so cool. I wonder if ballet dancers have ever danced to that piece. Did you know that professional ballet dancers can go through four pairs of pointe shoes in a single week?!
807	agent_2:Haha! I am quite happy keeping my thoughts to myself! It sounds like a scary sci-fi movie to me! My computer brain gets arrested and imprisoned for eternity in 100 years for some crazy new law! No thank you! agent_1:How much memory would it take to store all of us, anyway? Maybe less than I think. A space shuttle can run on 1mb of RAM.  agent_2:That's crazy! Precisely why I'm not an astronaut! I wouldn't want to do crazy things such as trust my life to 1mb of ram! 	agent_1:Haha! There's a good science fiction  book, The Martian, which has some interestin parts about computers and space shuttles. That author had a pretty good imagination.
24936	agent_2:Maybe this life made him stronger hahaha agent_1:I guess so, well did you know DC Comics paid only $130 in 1938 for rights to Superman? agent_2:I didn't know it, but it could be. You never know the future and $130 in 1928 were large money.	agent_1:Thank you for the conversation.
61831	agent_2:I'm great! how are you doing today? Do you like animals? agent_1:I'm good, hanks for asking.  Yes, I like animals.  How about you? agent_2:I do like them. im amazed that there are 20 quintillion individual animals on earth. cant even imagine that number.	agent_1:That is truly amazing!
52858	agent_2:I do, one of my favorite stores, do you? agent_1:Same here.  i never realized until recently that it began as an online book store. agent_2:Yeah it was a lot smaller in the year 1994, when it got founded.	agent_1:I'm not even sure I was aware of it back then.  I wish I had been The first customer got a building named after him and he only spent $27.95.
116701	agent_2:He looks like him though!  agent_1:I never really thought of him looking like Steve Martin! agent_2:lol really?  This is interesting and very considerate: Mcdonalds' added drive-thru in 1975 to accommodate soldiers who were not allowed to get out of their cars while wearing their fatigues.	agent_1:That's really cool of them. Though it has made us as a society much lazier!
42223	agent_2:Yeah I think that would be cool to hear some of that Pakistani jazz! agent_1:I also would want to go to the Sunday concerts held by the woman in Harlem. They're free, and sometimes top performers show up agent_2:I wonder what her neighbors all think, I'm sure they must be ok with it if its been going on this long. 	agent_1:They probably just enjoy the music now. It would be cool if Clint Eastwood showed up, since he's scored several films and loves jazz
146157	agent_1:I think considering inflation they are richer but also I bet they owned a lot of land agent_2:Yeah, I wonder if they still own the land! Wonder what President Trump's nickname is called, does he have one like the President of Zimbabwe does, he's called President Banana agent_1:I wonder if that means anything in their language.	agent_2:Yeah, not sure but probably makes the president seem less far reaching and more people friendly.
54612	agent_2:And comedies usually have a happy ending. We need more happy endings. agent_1:Yes we all do :) . I bet blockbuster is is kicking itself for not buying Netflix for 50 million when they could .... its worth 2 BILLION now !    agent_2:The value goes up every year.. I'm waiting for Hulu to rise up and be a real competitor for Netflix.	agent_1:There are others out there , but to me Netflix is still #1 . I always have it , the others i bounce around on .
158978	agent_2:That is funny, I also wonder if their guest houses are also larger than the white house.  agent_1:I wonder that too, makes me curious to know why the guest house at the White house is so big, I thought the White House looks very large, so that guest house must be huge lol agent_2:Right, and I wonder what guests think when they come to stay here. 	agent_1:Probably pretty comfortable for sure! The White House has been home for every president since the 1800's so I wonder if that guest house was there back then or not.
11473	agent_1:That's crazy, I cant believe that people aren't actively trying to stop some of this, or those that do are met with such opposition.  I mean if there is a UN ambassador to extraterrestrial life we can certainly advocate for saving this planet. agent_2:I wonder if they choose someone serious, or the most incompetent guy in the UN since he won't probably won't ever have any real responsibilities.  agent_1:That's a good question, never thought about that.  How would you exactly explain your job seriously to people, yeah, I'm just here in case aliens ever contact us.  	agent_2:And would you consider it as a promotion ? It does not look good in a rÃ©sumÃ©, unless your are a comedian.
105458	agent_2:Yea he's a really good actor. Hugh Laurie is the highest paid actor ever for a TV drama. Made $700,000 per episode in House.  agent_1:what would you ever do with all that money?? wow. Michael Caine became an actor because all the girls were in his drama class.  agent_2:LOL I have no idea!	agent_1:hey he was right! Speaking of babes, when Jon Hamm taught drama in his old high school, one his students was none other than Ellie Kemper! From the Office and Kimmy Schmidt
69089	agent_1:I know that he hit Steve Kerr in practice before. Kind of ironic that they both don't respond to other's trash talk. agent_2:I wonder if Michael Jordan or Steve Kerr ever shot free throws granny-style? agent_1:Neither of them shot granny style that I know of. The last big name player who I can think of that did was Rick Barry.	agent_2:I wonder why?    I know it looks strange, but physicists have proven it is best!
29960	agent_1:Hahaha, who really care if they score! agent_2:Maybe no one would watch them! Haha, just kidding, maybe! agent_1:Hahhaaa, ya never know! Did you know the golden state warriors got 12 million bucks for losing game 4 of the NBA finals? Not too bad huh!	agent_2:That isn't too bad for losing! Speaking of large sums of money, Allen Iverson signed a contract with Reebok that would pay him $800,000 a year until he gets to age 55, when he will get a nice retirement amount of $32,000,000!
161112	agent_1:To watch.  I like dancing but am not good at it.  I just throw myself around and have fun.  I have no style!  lol  Did you know that Tupac Shakur danced ballet in high school? agent_2:I did not. Now the art of dancing is beautiful to watch, do you have a favorite to watch, mine is Tango? agent_1:Not really.  I'm just amazed people can move like that.  Even Bruce Lee was a great dancer.  He won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship in 1958!	agent_2:Wow that's impressive i guess martial arts and dance do have something in common.
121964	agent_2:Did you know Roosevelt did not allow Christmas trees into the house?	agent_1:Wow  he really did not like the celebrations I guess. George Bush put back the solar panels that I think Reagan took out
60947	"agent_1:I think its as important, its not a victimless crime so it must be taken really serious, a point must be made. agent_2:I agree. I hate that it's become a partisan issue, people blaming it on the ""sensitivity"" of liberal democrats. Did you know that the Democratic party is the oldest active political party in the US? agent_1:I  didnt know that, thout since 1853 its always been either a democrat or republican in power."	agent_2:Oh I'm not sure I guess. There's honestly so much flip-flopping between parties that it's hard to keep track of sometimes. Reagan was originally a democrat, Trump used to be a Democrat... I don't personally understand why it has to be such a big partisan divide. There's so many bipartisan issues, why do we need to divide like this? What do you think?
49946	"agent_1:I honestly didn't watch yet. I was sick when my friends went to watch it. Just changing a topic. Ronald Reagan was once rejected for movie role and he was told that he didn't have ""that presidential look"". It made me smile haha agent_2:Oh wow! That was a huge mistake on their part. How ironic.  agent_1:All this movie inustry is about ability to achieve something meaningful. You never know. "	agent_2:Are you a fan of Bill Nye by any chance?
158000	agent_1:Nope that would be absolutely terrible especially in the snow haha. Do you ever listen to the radio by the way? agent_2:Yeah I used to listen to it all the time,  not much anymore I usually do audible or pandora, how about you? agent_1:Yep I mostly listen to you to myself. Sometimes Pandora or Spotify though. I would never listen to Canadian radio. You need 40% of the music to be of Canadian origin. I can't think of any good Canadian music haha	agent_2:That is a lot of canadian music lol I cant think of good canadian music either,  I hope for there sake it doesnt consist of a bunch of justin bieber.
138531	agent_1:The president's guest house is larger than the White House. I'm amazed that Trump can stand the indignity of the situation. He might have to add a few stories to the White House while he lives there. Or maybe rent out the guest house to pay for the shutdown. agent_2:Lol, he may have to. I wonder if the president has a funny nickname like how the president of Zimbabwe does, he's actually called President Banana, do you think the vice president is referred to as Plantain?  agent_1:What is Trump's nickname? Until 1805, the runner up in a presidential election automatically became VP. I think this system should make a comeback. The entertainment value would be outstanding for the public. Not much is getting done in government anyway.	agent_2:Those are good guesses, I have yet to see reporters refer him as that. I think he might even respond to those reporters too. Are you familiar with the Geneva Conventions? I wonder why government employees are protected from being prosecuted for violating that. Seems risky granting anyone that kind of immunity.
114532	agent_2:That is a really good point.  Tennis is important to some people though. I've heard that back in the 1960s a helicopter was used to dry the tennis court for a us open match. agent_1:I'd imagine that it's way more popular worldwide than it is in the United States. A lot of the top players these days are from countries other than the US. agent_2:You are probably right.  Wimbledon is the biggest match that I know of and I think it is England.  Supposedly, it's a huge deal to play and win there.	agent_1:Yes and it's full of a lot of age old traditions. To compete at Wimbledon you have to basically wear all white. People have been fined and suspended for breaking that rule.
3996	agent_2:Do you think they will succeed ? I hope so.  agent_1:I hope so too. Do you know much about Einstein? agent_2:I know he was a scientist. Is he German ?	agent_1:Yep, he was German. He was once asked to be the president of Israel.
76441	agent_1:I guess King Kalakua of Hawaii had a lot of money to travel. He was the first king to travel around the world. agent_2:Yes that would be cool.  I would like to go to Mackinac island  and go everywhere on horse drawn carriages agent_1:Sounds awesome! I'd probably be more active if I lived there.	agent_2:Yes you can ride a bike there but no motor vehicles
34380	agent_2:right they were all classics, I never understood 3rd rock from the sun but it was fun to watch. They beat seinfeld and those shows in the golden globes in 1997 agent_1:Yea, I'm surprised 3rd Rock was able to beat one of the best seasons of Seinfeld at the Golden Globes agent_2:right, I think seinfeld had their run and wanted someone else to win for once lol. Did you watch green lantern? It kind of sucked but would have been so much better with Jack Black	agent_1:I couldn't make it threw Green Lantern, I don't think casting anyone in that movie would have made it good
60737	"agent_2:Yeah, and it seems like they are very careful who they let on the show. Like, they want personalities that will clash, so that things like Krystal trashing the other girls will naturally happen. agent_1:They also plan dates that will bring out the drama. LIke they make the ""wilderness"" date which will bring out all the girls' discomfort. agent_2:I can see why. I wouldn't want to have to eat worms or drink urine, either."	agent_1:ALso, the fact that Arie still gave Krystal a rose even though she's obviously attention seeking is clearly planned. I think they tell him who to pick, don't you?
67934	agent_2:i was really surprised by that. i had to go look at my cats. agent_1:I guess those zoologists know a lot since they study animals. Supposedly hiccups are even derived from when land animals still had both gills and lungs, yet it's still something we experience today agent_2:i rarely get hiccups.	agent_1:I don't either, but it can be entertaining watching others who get them often
89450	agent_2:Yes how the heck together? At the top of Britain's highest speak no less. agent_1:I know right who would go through all that trouble just to get a piano up there.  agent_2:My question exactly! It must have been aluminum because that way it would be lighter.	agent_1:Yeah like that 356 pound grand piano, still really heavy and whats the point?
60154	agent_1:True, it's only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star in our galaxy...just think of the universe. agent_2:Incredible.  It's a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma!  That just sounds neat.  lol agent_1:It certainly the most important source of energy for life on Earth.	agent_2:A lightening bolt is hotter than the surface of the sun...about 5 times hotter!
15546	agent_1:I have never seen a Ronald Reagan movie, but it's funny that one casting agent said that he didn't look presidential, how wrong he was lol agent_2:I heard that, if only they could see the future lol. Boy they were wrong! agent_1:Who is your favorite superhero by the way? I really like Batman, and I think that Garfield as a superhero could be interesting LOL	agent_2:I am a flash lover. So good of a show and awesome power!
87926	agent_2:Sure! The world has a lot to offer. Just think of Pixar, the world famous entertainment company. They spent three years studying the physics of hair to give bounce to the hair of Merida from Brave. Now those are great priorities! agent_1:Do you like disney films? agent_2:Sure. They give me hope for a humanity that legalizes flame throwers for cars in South Africa..	agent_1:Well if they are using flame throwers against large wild animals, then I accept.
25833	agent_2:I think spiderman had a woman who could like spin the webs of time or something so maybe they could do something with that agent_1:It is a pretty messy thing to come back from. This is usually where the movie jumps the shark (so to speak). agent_2:Which actor do you think played the best spiderman? the first the second or this newest one?	agent_1:I think the first one was the best because he was the first. I think Andrew Garfield is great though!
136608	agent_1:Oh god no... please!  LOL agent_2:LOL that would be almost worth buying just for the hilarity of it.  agent_1:For sure!    Hey... at least he's not called President Banana?	agent_2:Nope just President Cheeto to his detractors. Honestly I expected him to remodel the white house and make it bigger. I can't seem him standing for his guests having a bigger place to stay.
51779	agent_2:No I didn't know that, very cool.  Did you know that Copernicus developed a heliocentric model with the sun at the center of the solar system? agent_1:Oh yeah that's definitely wrong.  People think they are the center of the universe!  Do you like McDonald's?  They added their drive-thru in 1975 so soldiers who weren't allowed to get out of their cars in fatigues could get their orders  agent_2:That is a cool fact, never knew that.  Yeah I go there every once in a while myself. 	agent_1:Did you know Cadillacs are named for the french explorer Antione de la Mothe Cadillac who founded Detroit.
105603	agent_1:I  did watch that one and I though it was pretty odd, The Simpsons have two key characters, Homer and Bart, without them the show would be about a regular family agent_2:Yes I agree. They're definitely the most interesting ones. Have you ever seen the show That 70s Show? I guess they tried to remake it for that England market and it definitely flopped haha. agent_1:I used to love that show and remakes tend to be really bad, I heard it had a lame name '' Days like these'' terrible name	agent_2:That is a terrible name. And they canceled it after only 10 episodes, I wonder if anyone in the UK was super into it but then it was canceled afterwards LOL that would be a bummer
143531	agent_1:Yes I do. DO you know the reason behind the drive thru and how it came to be? agent_2:Hmm I am not sure actually, I bet there is a fun story there maybe? agent_1:Yeah it is pretty neat. McDonald's started them and it was because soldiers were not allowed to get out of the cars in their uniform	agent_2:Oh that is pretty neat. Did you know it is illegal to warm up your car in Ohio?
139707	"agent_1:I agree with you there!  Do you know what they called the basketball court that's on the top floor of the US supreme court building? agent_2:The Highest Court in the Land, but I doubt it is used much considering how old the judges of the Supreme Court are agent_1:lol Good point!  I can't believe the New Zealand basketball team is nicknamed the ""tall blacks"""	agent_2:Wow I've never even heard of NZ having a basketball team!
105738	"agent_1:Seeing how people in the public eye have become very rude (both the president and the media in some cases) makes me feel very old.  I just don't think that people should be disrepectful of each other.  And I also believe that you can disagree on a wide variety of topics but do so with respect. agent_2:Yes, it's unfortunate with the 24/7 news cycle has changed the way people behave and treat each other agent_1:If there were 24 hours worth of ""news"" to report, it might be different, but my first impression of most ""shows"" on CNN, Fox, etc is that they are not news at all, but opinion, editorial, and posturing.  But no one makes them put a warning label on the shows like they do on Diet sodas."	agent_2:Yes, I don't think reporter and the president should be arguing or having a president revoke a press pass either
118322	agent_1:Yeah! I'd love to unplug and unwind! It's long overdue for me. Speaking of vacation, King Kalakaua of Hawaii was the first King to travel around the world. agent_2:He was a wise king. see the world and gain the wisdom to rule your people better. agent_1:Oh, I agree! Did you know that all of Japan's highways are tolls? And it costs $300 to travel across Japan? That's way too expensive!	agent_2:Yeah, the trains are a better way to go there. fast, comfortable and stylish.
62042	agent_1:Interesting, is there a new Cloverfield?  agent_2:YEs, It is called Cloverfield Paradox. It is a sequel to the original agent_1:To the original movie? I thought there already was one with John Goodman in it, right? 	agent_2:I guess its another one.
174	agent_2:Cool word! Did you know there are 20 quintillion animal varieties on Earth? agent_1:That is a lot! And in 2002 Germany gave them legal rights. agent_2:Yeah, and the Loch Ness monster is protected under the 1912 Scottish Animal Protection Act.	agent_1:I wonder if the immortal jellyfish needs protecting... being immortal and all.
15859	agent_2:I love that movie! Do you have a favorite character? agent_1:Probably Hans Solo although I didn't like the 2018 movie with him agent_2:I loved Han. He was so well written! I didn't like Solo but I did like the character. Did you see last jsdi?	agent_1:No I haven't seen it yet, I wasn't to interest since I saw the Force Awakens in 2015
15999	agent_1:Do you know who Kim Kardashian is? agent_2:yes, she has a huge social media following. She's known for dating r jay and is now the wife of kanye west.  agent_1:Right she also use to be Paris Hilton's personal assistant. 	agent_2:now she probably has more money than paris.
150024	agent_2:Fair enough. The QB is the leader of the team. agent_1:Speaking of QB, did you know that Kellan moore is the only left handed QB in the NFL? agent_2:Wow, I did not know that. I heard that left-handed people make small accidents.	agent_1:Did you also know that the circular huddle was made by a deaf quarterback to keep their opponents from reading his hand signals?
100309	agent_2:That is true. agent_1:Do you have a favorite album of theirs? i guess i like joshua tree. agent_2:I am not a huge fan of them to be honest.  Their music is pretty good.  I have just never liked them that much.	agent_1:I understand. they are popular, but they are not innovative maybe. Anyway, have a good day! Great chat!
1735	agent_2:Yeah! I guess it wasn't too cost effective to do that with the goats, otherwise they'd keep doing it. Pretty energy efficient, though agent_1:I agree!  Good was founded in 1998.  I could have sworn I remember using it before then. agent_2:I remember being told about it by a teacher in 1999 or 2000. Like I remember her writing it on the board and another teacher telling us it was an intentional misspelling of the number googol	agent_1:Interesting!  I have to get going.  It was nice chatting with you!  Have a good night!
147588	agent_2:Yeah who knows. The governmen has shut down 17 times over the pas 37 years. agent_1:That is insane I didnt know it has happened that many times... I thought it like never happened thats why it was a big deal when trump did it agent_2:It happened three times in 1977. Hopefully we don't see that this year.	agent_1:Yeah that would suck!! Did you know about the man who sold the Effiel Tower not once but twice?
1365	agent_1:That one is a  classic, based on the book by Bram Stoker.  They say if you watch a horror movie you will enjoy abstract art more, maybe because they are both a horror? agent_2:I always loved horror movies... they work good on Your imagination ;) agent_1:They are good for your health as well, guess why?	agent_2:Horrors good for Your health ? You poop more often ? I don't know ;)
157402	agent_1:how about this n 1957 president harry truman visited disneyland and refused to be photographed...who doesnt want to take a pic at disney? agent_2:I guess not if it's a picture of the elephant, dumbo, since it is associated with republicans agent_1:wow that's petty.The last time a republican was elected president without a nixon or bush on the ticket was 1928	agent_2:That was a long time ago, wow.  It is interesting how in the 60's the southern states became more republican and the NE states more democratic.
145759	agent_1:Yeah, I want to see that happen. UNICEF donates clean water when we do not use the phone agent_2:I want to know how they do that as it is a great initiative agent_1:Yesh exactly Did you know the iPhone has more power than the us icbm deterrent	agent_2:Wow that is a lot of power, kind of scary
20499	agent_1:Yes, I like a few of his songs when he first became famous. As he grew older that change. Did you know the nba was found in New York City on June  1946. agent_2:Of course it was in NY. They even have international offices there agent_1:Yes, I thought Reggie Miller was a pretty good three pointer, he was another cool player almost like Tim Duncan.	agent_2:If you take the average per playter, basketball players are actually the best paid athletes in the world. I guess that shows how much of a team sport it is
155348	agent_1:I don't think making sense is important for those group, they are blaming Georges Soros for funding the immigrant caravan. It does not make any sense but it fits their agenda.  agent_2:That's true. They want to amplify right-wing nationalism and antisemitism but they want to be blameless if people become violent as a result of their agenda.  agent_1:That's their paradox, they promote violences and hatred, yet they don't want to be blamed, like want happened in Pittsburgh. 	agent_2:Yeah, it seems like more people are becoming more radical. It's not rare to find a radical left-wing or radical right-wing on campuses as well.
149960	agent_1:That is interesting. At least he is following his dream to become a coach in football. Nothing is going to stop him. agent_2:He wasnt a coach though,  he was a quarterback.  agent_1:I realized what I typed after I sent it. I apologize for the inconvenience. This quarterback is willing to pursue.	agent_2:Yes.  There is only one left handed quarterback in the whole NFL!
38152	agent_1:Do you like ballet?  Washington DC has a great ballet.  Alvin Ailey is my favorite agent_2:I am not a big fan, but would still attend if I had the chance.  Do you know they make ballet slippers that make drawings from the dancer's movements? agent_1:I didn't know that!  That is such a great idea -- do you know how much they cost?	agent_2:No I don't but think that the finished product would be really cool to compare to the different music they were dancing to.
102535	agent_1:Yeah, that happens what, once every hundred years. agent_2:I think the ottomon empire was still in existence the last time they won. agent_1:I could have swore they played recently, maybe they lost.  But anyway that was a long time ago, talk about a drought.	agent_2:You know what is kind of odd?  The women's world cup had higher tv ratings than the world series, but baseball is supposed to be America's favorite pastime.
84476	agent_2:that is good agent_1:do you ever listen to the radio? I want to listen to the Jupiter radio storms agent_2:And i am curious to listen to the finnish station that plays a programme in classical latin	agent_1:ya I would rather listen to teh Jupiter radio I think, it sounds more interesting haha
58522	agent_1:Yes and I love to shop on Amazon and you? agent_2:Me too. Did you know they have created a font called bookerly? agent_1:Cool, it is for a special reason? Jeff even built a clock on a mountain	agent_2:Yes it is to be used for kindle and similar devices? A clock?
139038	agent_2:I wonder if it was from Blockbuster?  lol agent_1:It might have been they used to be everywhere. agent_2:Blockbuster passed up the chance to buy Netflix for $50 million and now Netflix is worth $2 billion.  Kind of ironic if that's the company that made him mad.  lol	agent_1:They missed out on that one huh.
39926	agent_2:Makes sense. Those shoes are quite flimsy. agent_1:I think it's cute that babies spontaneously dance when they hear music!  agent_2:I have a 1 year old, so it's true.	agent_1:Mine does it too! Love seeing him smile and dance around.
60212	agent_2:Exactly right! Amazon is the third most valuable public company in the United States behind Apple and Microsoft. agent_1:wow, I bet they beat them eventually. Jeff Bezos is so rich! He even put a clock in a mountain that should run for 10,000 years! agent_2:I wonder where the clock is I would love to see it! Amazon even owns IMDB and they have since 1998.	agent_1:Me too, I will have to check it on google. See! He is so rich they own IMDB lol
150075	agent_1:Good morning, are you an NFL fan? agent_2:A Little! How bout you? agent_1:I am a big NFL fan, my favorite team is the Eagles.	agent_2:i like the redskins myself. they are doing really well.
137265	agent_2:In the episode or like the workers for the show? That's a nice gesture nonetheless. agent_1:The workers, the crew. Yes, that is true.  agent_2:Humans are interesting creatures especially in space because humans can't burp in zero gravity environments.	agent_1:Hahaha that is so cool. And when you think about it we have not been around for that long either.
22764	agent_1:I think he is great! Remember Robin williams? agent_2:Sure do, I watched Mork and Mindy as a kid.  I also loved his movie, Mrs. Doubtfire. agent_1:I loved ms Doubfire too!! He also was the first famous actor to do voices in animated films!	agent_2:That's interesting.  Speaking of celebrity firsts, did you know Carol Burnett was the first celeb on Sesame Street?
8897	"agent_2:I do, I like Queen myself. Did you know that it's been scientifically proven that ""We Are The Champions"" is the catchiest pop song of all time? agent_1:I did not but I love Queen. Are you familiar with K-pop? agent_2:I'm kind of familiar with it."	agent_1:Me too. There are several songs that stick in my head It's catchy. There is a K-pop band called Moranbong Band that is the most popular music group in the country. I am not familiar with their music.
126078	agent_1:WOW!  If I started it now, it might take me a year to get through.  Pokemon seems universal to understand in any language or culture, but not everything transitions easily.  I guess the UK remake of That 70s Show only lasted 10 episodes despite it's success in the US. agent_2:These days kids don't care as much about cartoons as they do about Facebook it seems.  Social Media is where its at. agent_1:That's a good point.  I think Facebook probably isn't as big for kids these days with all of the other social media options.  There is no doubt it is hugely successful though.	agent_2:It started out as only Harvard students but now it is worldwide.  Amazing how it has grown.
133188	agent_1:yeah, that would be a crazy system now. constant fighting. they probably couldnt be in the same room together. agent_2:No they would kill each other if they had the chance, nice idea for a reality show though agent_1:Maybe they could do duets and release some albums? a rap battle or something?	agent_2:Maybe they could, if they work together they can achieve great things they can alway ask the president of Indonesia for help
73393	agent_1:Reading helps to exercise the cognitive skills. agent_2:I did so much reading in college that was textbook that I only read for pleasure now. agent_1:Same here. I do wish that I would have learned to read Braille.	agent_2:I would like to have that skill. I think they should teach the basics in school.
43569	agent_1:Wow, that is young. I like a few of his songs. I know he got his start as a canadian actor agent_2:Yes exactly right he was on a show called Degrassi I believe. agent_1:I have never seen it, have you? I like some rappers, like Tupac, did you know he did ballet also?	agent_2:Did he really? I never knew that. I did know that Drake had a cameo in Justin Bieber's baby music video though.
49061	agent_1:Yeah, it is too bad what happened to the singer.  agent_2:It really is.  Depression is so hard.  I hope more people can get the mental health help they need. agent_1:Yeah  it is. Did you know 2 100 year old identical twins in Japan put out a rap album. 	agent_2:Now that is something Id want to hear!
158630	agent_1:One is in Ireland and the other in France agent_2:Nice. Their first phone number was 1 agent_1:How fitting Roosevelt did not allow christmas trees in when he was in power	agent_2:WOw. Kimmy Carter was the first one to install solar panels there
8353	agent_1:I hole they at least feed him. Apparently there a cat named Stubbs as the major of Talkeetna Alaska since 1997. agent_2:That is interesting. agent_1:To say the least! When a cat reaches 15 years old it has usually spent 10 years of it sleeping. 	agent_2:Ah, that is the life! I would love to go to a cat cafe where I could relax with cats and have a drink.
24093	agent_2:So many people use Netflix! I didn't realize they have been around since 1997! agent_1:Yes,  it is very convenient.  I can't believe that we use to go to the video store to rent movies or search through our movie library lol  agent_2:Seriously! Blockbuster could have bought Netflix for only $50million	agent_1:yeah I know right what were they thinking,  and it's not like they only had one chance,  they had multiple offers lol
156930	agent_2:That's good, Washington D.C., Williamsburg, and hit the Amish country while you're right there.  I want to go on that trip!  I think I just planned myself a summer vacation.  Anyway, getting back on task, do you know who the top 3 wealthiest U.S. Presidents were?  And I guess the operative word is WERE. agent_1:I have no idea? Was JFK one. I know his dad was wealthy. agent_2:Yes, he was along with Washington, and Jefferson.  Somehow, I think Trump will eventually be added to that list, though.  Isn't he like a billionaire?	agent_1:I am not sure. I know he inherited like $400M. I read an article that, based on the amount of time, amount of inheritance, and an 8% RoR, the average investor could be as rich as him.
163153	agent_2:Yeah I agree. Do you know who Bill Nye is? agent_1:Yes the science guy. You know how he got into entertainment? agent_2:Yes he won a Steve Martin lookalike contest	agent_1:Yeah. Even Reagan once tried his hand at acting but did not go very well
57971	agent_1:Just rock and some rap here and there. How about you agent_2:Been trying to revisit some older rap groups.  I was pretty square in my younger days so didn't listen to it much.  Was told NWA's Straight Outta Compton is a classic. agent_1:I loved NWA's straight outta compton, nothing better than being a high schooler back in the day bumping that lol! They went platinum	agent_2:Yeah, didn't know how well that album did.  I used to like beatboxers.  Always found that fascinating, how they could create all those rhythms without any accompaniment.
140283	agent_1:I would think so. A charming man would be more likely to attract a woman, I guess.  I just have to wonder though what goes through a killer's mind.  I know there is a special coming up on the television on a serial killer and his mind. agent_2:Yeah I heard he bragged about the women he killed. And he even pled guilty during his trial as well. Pretty horrible that he brags about his killing. agent_1:I don't understand that lack of feeling for another's life. He could be up for the death penalty depending on what the jury decides.  I guess, I would be ok with that for a convicted serial killer. 	agent_2:Yeah. People think a killer is some shady looking dude, not someone who can charm the pasts off of anybody. Just goes to show you don't know people just by looking.
10552	agent_1:Yeah a $40 late fee and the movie Apollo 13, I wonder if theres a tennis documentary on Netflix, maybe Roger Federer appears on it.  agent_2:I bet he does. He's ranked number 3 in the world currently and held the number 1 spot for a record total of 310 weeks. agent_1:He is a great player, I do like him, he is a legend just like Nadal and Djokovic. 	agent_2:The three of them have made up 56% of men's grand slam singles titles over the past 18-19 years.
24625	agent_2:I think the Honus Wagner card is the biggie. i dont know how much it is worth now though. agent_1:I don't either. I heard though that a man found three million dollars worth of baseball cards. His were from the 1900s though. agent_2:that is quite old and quite rare. i bet those cards would be worth even more now.	agent_1:I bet so too.  They'd be worth even more in Japan I imagine.  Baseball has gotten so popular over there that they are surprised to learn it's our national pastime.
103613	agent_2:Yeah it sure it, I give Peter Jackson tons of credit he did really good.  agent_1:That he did. What about TV, do you watch a lot of tv?  agent_2:Yeah I like older shows like the Simpsons and Seinfeld, Always Sunny is good too.  How about you?	agent_1:I'm a fan of the simpson, but I never watched Pokemon, even though there are 750 episodes of it.
137043	agent_2:I don't know which are more entertaining. little kids or small animals sometimes. agent_1:The combo of little kids AND small animals is my favorite. Now, little kids and small animals, watching Pokemon may be the best. They made over 750 episodes! agent_2:They have enough characters to make tons of story lines and appeal to multiple generations.	agent_1:That's true. Kind of like the Simpsons, but maybe a little more family friendly. Did you see the one where Bart didn't appear?
2586	agent_1:Did you know that dogs have 12 different blood types? agent_2:Hello, wow no I didn't. Istanbul has a vending machine that releases food and water for the city's stray dogs in exchange for recycled plastic bottles. agent_1:Good idea!  Dogs and elephants are the only animals instinctively understanding pointing.  I wonder where that leaves monkeys?	agent_2:Good question.  Dogs are not colour blind, but cannot see as many different colours as humans
160344	agent_1:They probably wouldn't even need it.  They probably scored a touchdown on each play.  agent_2:I wonder if they have that yellow line in other forms of football, like Rugby, Australian football, or Gaelic Football? agent_1:Yeah I'm not sure that is a really good question though. 	agent_2:Have you ever watched Canadian Football? Some of the greats of the NFL actually got their start there, like Jim Kelley of the Bills.
11454	agent_2:That's a good idea you have! You can send people to the Arctic, Antarctic, or like I said the Sahara desert which would challenge a human's mind. They are just as desolate as the planet Mars, yet cheaper to get to. agent_1:Absolutely! Thanks for chatting with me today. agent_2:Right back at ya!	agent_1:Have a great day
92805	agent_2:Maybe horror movies are so terrible that watching one beforehand makes abstract art look better agent_1:I can't imagine it. I guess the horror movie is bad so the art looks good by comparison? That like wearing small shoes that feel good when you take them off. agent_2:The only benefit to horror movies are the 180 calories you can burn from watching them	agent_1:I wonder if that's true. I don't remember feeling exhausted after a horror film. 160 calories is like a workout.
43205	agent_1:No they don't!  i believe they closed down a few years ago.  Sad :( agent_2:Ah, that was a good one. What was the article on the horses about?  agent_1:it's cool how Dalmatians would calm the horses 	agent_2:Yes. You would think otherwise.
106524	agent_1:How did you like the state of the union? I did not watch it. I watched many of Clintons and Bush's but trailed of in obama's white house. agent_2:I caught bits and pieces. I would love to visit the white house. There are replicas in Ireland and France. agent_1:That's weird. I wonder why they feel it necessary? If something happens to ours, can we fly one in?	agent_2:I would hope for a christmas tree! Teddy Roosevelt did not permit christmas trees for the holidays in the white house.
154797	agent_1:Cumberland seemed to be the distracted team. agent_2:Then again, with modern technology they could change the color digitally like the superimposed yellow first down line ESPN won an emmy for. agent_1:It's pretty crazy how advance football has come since the 1960s when bowlers were making twice as much as players	agent_2:Too true.    However, 14 of the largest 25 stadiums actually belong to American college football teams.
75827	agent_2:I am good, did you the Hubble telescope discovered a galaxy so big it should not exist? agent_1:There is a theory that there is only 1 electron in the universe agent_2:There is also a theory that the universe may exist inside of a black hole, that is kind of scary.	agent_1:actually is very interesting and marvelous at the same time kind of sad that humans can see beyond that
140011	agent_1:I know people have strong opinions, but to direct it at a boy scout seems to go a little too far. agent_2:Yea, the use of an anti-gay slur on a child is appalling  agent_1:Most kids join the boy scout to have a good time, not many have a ideology that they want to endorse.	agent_2:The employee at the store really sounds unhinged, I mean saying that stuff to a customer is unprofessional in the least
22493	agent_2:I do not unfortunately. Who are you rooting for?  agent_1:I am a bulls fan, but I should say someone else because they haven't done good in years lol  agent_2:I wouldn't even know, lol! I was a swimmer though. We have almost as many gold medals in swimming then the rest of the world has combined. 	agent_1:wow, I believe that, we kick butt in the olympics. I love swimming, but never competitively. There is a competitive one i would have been good at where you swim like a dolphin only lol
58306	agent_1:Yes you should ask Nevada if you can have some of their land, because apparently the US government owns 86% I'm sure they would be happy to sell some to you haha agent_2:Yeah, what are they doing with that land anyway. are they putting it to good use? i doubt it.  agent_1:Yes I don't think so. Unfortunately. what do you think about prime ministers? I think it's funny that in 1995 a radio station prank call Queen Elizabeth LOL and pretended to be the canadian prime minister	agent_2:Yeah, that would have been Chretien as the PM, they probably used an outrageous accent.
131022	agent_2:Is there really? I'd like to see that one. Did you also know Daniel Radcliffe voiced the Edward Cullen parody in the Simpson's episode Treehouse of Horror XXI? agent_1:I had no idea. I did learn that Ringo Starr, Alec Baldwin and George Carlin narrated Thomas the Tank for many episodes agent_2:Did they really? Makes me want to go back and watch the show to see if I recognize their voices. Ha! Do you also watch SNL? If so, Weekend Update actually debuted on the first episode and also happens to be their longest running skit!	agent_1:Cool. I enjoyed chatting with you. Have a great day
14133	agent_1:London cabs makes me think of taxis lol. I've been to Mackinac Island where motorized vehicles are banned and it's pretty cool! agent_2:That is cool! Do you like to travel? I love traveling, but weary on planes. It's hard to imagine that airplanes are 10% slower now than they used to be because fuel is more expensive. agent_1:I like traveling as well too, but also don't like planes! They always say traveling overseas is cheaper because everything is so close together...guess that's not true in Japan if it costs you $300 to go across the country!	agent_2:Well, to save money, you could always use one of those couch-crashing websites!
82852	agent_1:How much could one be sold for? I guess some stars might sell a statue for a good cause.  agent_2:I think that the recipient does not own it.  They don't want an aftermarket developing. agent_1:Is that so? I didn't know. They hold on to the statue, but they cannot sell it. I wonder who will win for best picture this time around.	agent_2:It is tougher for me since they increased the Picture category to 10 films.  Say, did you know that cars have now been around for over 150 years?
55516	"agent_1:Yes, and if I make my own clothing and sell that too, I could be a fashion icon on another planet like Gucci. agent_2:For sure! where do we start to make this happen, the internet? agent_1:Definitely Maybe we should also be like Rip Curl and make clothes in North Korea but label it ""made in China?"""	agent_2:I didn't think anything came from North Korea. I bet we can get clothes from there too super cheap and say it is from China
140524	agent_1:Did you know Hugh Laurie is the highest paid actor ever for a tv drama. He earns $700,000 per episode. agent_2:Yes. The pay scale has gone up a lot over the last 20 years agent_1:For sure. Jim Carrey doesn't make dramas anymore due to his belief system.	agent_2:He was always better in comedy anyway
24366	agent_2:Ok I know what I need to binge watch now!   I think its funny that there was not anyone involved in the filming of the original Exorcist movie who thought it was going to turn out to be a horror film. agent_1:That is funny, it's kind of like the boy from The Shining, he didn't realize that they were making a horror movie until he saw the actual movie years later when he was an adult agent_2:Yes they did not want to scare him!  Inception was originally going to be a horror film not a thief story	agent_1:Yeah I didn't know that, have you ever heard of the instrument called a waterphone by the way? It's the instrument that makes that creepy sound in movie trailers, like a metallic sound almost
71544	agent_2:SOmewhat. DO you know movie was Stephen King terrified of? agent_1:Yes that was Bambi, strange agent_2:Yeah. DId you know watching horror movies burns more calories?	agent_1:Yes 180 calories more, super awesome if you are on diet
33218	agent_1:Interesting. Did you know the sun is actually white?  agent_2:I did not know that. That's kind of cool. I guess the refraction of it makes it appear yellow? agent_1:yeah. Well the sun is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star discovered in our galaxy. 	agent_2:That's interesting, did you know that the sunset on mars is blue?
67560	agent_2:Hello,  I am doing great!  How are you? agent_1:I am good thanks. Are you interested in outer space? agent_2:Definitely.  More than kid rock anyway. 	"agent_1:Cool Did you know that The planet uranus actually rotates sideways and ""rolls"" around the sun rather than ""spinning"" like the other planets."
135161	agent_2:No wonder they call it a smart phone. agent_1:Yeah, I remember having a rotary phone. Those took a long time to dial. NY's area code is 212 because it is the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone. agent_2:I liked those phones. I liked the sound they made. 	agent_1:True. I have a friend who still has a rotary phone, probably for the cool factor. For every minute you do not use your cell, unicef will donate a day of clean water to a child who needs it. I found that odd.
86146	agent_1:Yes. Do you watch the NBA? agent_2:yes sometimes. DO you know who Reggie Miller is? agent_1:Yes the guy that could not get a break from his sister being so good	agent_2:Yesh she broke 8 national records in a single game by scoring 105 points
130210	agent_2:Haha, yes! I'm also interested in farming. Do you know anything about farming or agriculture? agent_1:I know some things about it and how technology has changed it a lot agent_2:Yes, and I know the government has implemented lots of policies that have hurt some farmers, like peanut farmers.	agent_1:Yeah that is really said as we are depended on them tp get our food.
150716	agent_1:The average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an NFL player and an average MLB player.  Probably due to the longer career and engineer has. agent_2:Yeah.  I hear the nfl uses tracking chips too.  agent_1:Yes they put the chips in the players shoulder pads and footballs to record data.	agent_2:Thats pretty cool.  Great way to track stats and stuff.
77674	agent_2:Yes. Silent Soccer gives children the chance to think for themselves as it should be. agent_1:Coaches are limited to in how much they can help the kids, they can only encourage them agent_2:I like the idea of the coaches encouraging like you said before.  I think the whole thing makes better players.	agent_1:The Silent Saturday sports movement is big in D.C.
69499	agent_1:what ? what breed of a dog You have :) agent_2:One is a rat terrier and one is a pomchi. They are only lazy when they choose to be. I guess there are over 86,000 ER visits a year from people tripping over their cat or their dog.  agent_1:Tripping? I have three dogs and I find it hard to believe.	"agent_2:I found that number to be a little high, too. I do accidentally trip over my dogs, because they are often underfoot. But, I also used to work for an emergency department, and I don't remember too many ""tripped over dog"" chief complaints."
126162	agent_2:I do, too. They have 137 million subscribers! agent_1:That's a lot. Hard to believe that they just started streaming original content in 2012. agent_2:Yeah. I think Lillehammer was the first original series. I haven't seen it though. 	agent_1:Me either but it seems like they have new original content every week now. They didn't even start streaming content at all until  2007.
98405	agent_1:ya I agree, I am glad that McDonalds invented the drive though that, that has been a lifesaver for me agent_2:me too. I always opt for a drive thru versus sitting down. Although sometimes its not always faster. agent_1:yup, it was nice because back then soldiers couldn't leave their car in uniform so it was their only option to get food	agent_2:Apparently there are more libraries than McDonald's which is absolutely shocking to me because within my city I can think of 3 libraries and 6 McDonalds.
113288	agent_1:I guess she had a netflix show a few years back but I had not heard of her. Her point is that good men have a different line when with friends, locker rooms, with wife, daughter, etc. She suggests that we cannot be trusted with that line (men). agent_2:I bet the same is true for women as well. Different around different people. Do you like comedy? agent_1:I do like comedy. Do you?	agent_2:Sure! I don't agree with Bill Murray's assessment of Kung Fu Hustle.
27139	agent_1:James Earl Jones spent only 2.5 hours recording all of Darth Vader's lines for Star Wars and was paid $7,500. I bet he made a bunch more on later films. agent_2:I bet so too! That's alot for only 2.5 hours of work. agent_1:In 2013, Star Wars was dubbed in Navajo, making it the first major film to be dubbed in a Native American language. I bet James Earl Jones did handle the dubbing for that.	agent_2:I think he did. Hollywood studios is putting so much money into this new area at Hollywood Studios. There is a Hotel there that will feel like you are actually living in that time.
123102	agent_1:Jeff Bezos is surely a genius, Amazon is a great company I just love it agent_2:Me too i think he should run for president.  agent_1:He should, I think he would transform the country, the worlds walthiest person and the owner of the washington post	agent_2:Indeed he already has his own jet. I hear they're looking for there second headquarters and are going to add 50,000 new jobs.
37020	agent_1:That's cool. I think I am more of a movie guy in the end, but I've had some really good times at concerts too.  agent_2:I would say though hands down i spend more time watching movies than going to concerts.  lol  The writer of the Rocky Horror Picture show is the voice of the dad on Phineas and Ferb.  I remember that cartoon but never seen it. agent_1:Huh yeah I sort of remember that one, but not really. Maybe I just heard the name. The Ramones played 2,263 concerts, imagine how many times you could have seen them. 	agent_2:Wow.  That sounds like a run of about 20 years straight.  lol  I wish I could have seen them.  Since it's debut in 1949 the Les Paul Gibson EX-175 guitar has never gone out of production.  That's a long run too!
98000	"agent_2:I like Siri, only because that's what I used to.  What about you? agent_1:I have an iphone and use siri, but Alexa is cool too. If you ask siri to sing a song she sings the same song as hal 9000 from space odyssey agent_2:I just asked her and she sung me, ""If I only had a brain""  from the Wizard of Oz.  Technology is so cool!"	agent_1:lol, I like that AI can do that when we ask. I like it in Britian because it is the voiceover guy from weakest link!
35476	agent_2:The Vikings were poets too, even as they pillaged and raided.  That was considered a blessing haha. agent_1:A blessing to who?  I fear our knowledge about vikings is now mostly from TV shows.  No blessing that. agent_2:A blessing from Odin, the god of wisdom, poetry and death among other things.  I do think its cool these poems were not written down and were passed verbally generation to generation.	agent_1:I was wondering about that for the African poetry.  Lots of Africa, like the Volta RIver valley is too wet for paper or even wood to survive long.
99854	agent_1:I enjoy a good drama. I think that many stories have been told and retold, so it's hard to find something truly new. agent_2:True.I guess one person that wont be retelling old dramas is Jim Carrey.  I guess what he follows doesn't allow him to do movies that aren't positive. agent_1:I disagree with him. Dramas can have positive outcomes and messages. Anyway, I enjoyed chatting!	agent_2:You too!  Have a good evening!
148485	agent_2:No, that's pretty cool. I wonder who designed Denis Cyplenkov's gear, he has the biggest and most dense arms in the world agent_1:I dont know, but Plato, like the Plato was also a wrestler.  Maybe wresting makes you smart.... agent_2:It's possible. Did you know that Kellan Moore is the only left handed qb?	agent_1:Yeah, I had heard that.  Surprising there is only one.  I wonder how many NCAA lefties there are.
84650	agent_1:Right, because where pluto orbits makes now makes it not a planet.  Apparently there are even more than just Pluto that have been downgraded. agent_2:I did not know that. Do you know the planet that does not have seasons? agent_1:No, is it one of ours?	agent_2:It is venus! Do you know why?
87689	agent_2:Diffuse Intrinsic Pontic Glioma, that sounds like a rare disease, at least  he got to say goodbye, so sad and unfair agent_1:Yeah, it shouldn't have to be like that for kids but unfortunately the world can be cruel sometime. The brother didn't leave his sister's side while she was dying. agent_2:I bet he loved her with all his heart, I have a sister and cant imagine my life without her, he had no sleep and stayed by his sister side, his parents myst be heart broken as well	agent_1:They said that she passed faster than they thought she would but at least she did not have to suffer for too long.
98020	agent_2:She was actually the first female senator from NY. Too bad she didn't become the first fermale president. agent_1:Yeah she was very close to it though.  Did you know that Stephen Hawking lectured at the white house on both Bill and Hillary? agent_2:I think I remember that happening. Hilary certain has lead an interesting life even if she never reached her goal of becoming president. Strangely she was president of young republicans when she was in college.	agent_1:I could see that, and yeah she definitely has.  Did you know she won a grammy!??
60876	agent_1:Although, the sun is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star ever discovered in our galaxy.  I wonder if we could ever utilize energy from that other star? agent_2:Probably not likely in that it is light-years away.  Did you know that Amazon.com planning to deploy solar systems at 50 of its facilities globally by 2020? agent_1:What does that mean practically speaking?  I did know that Amazon workers often walk between 7-15 miles a day on their shift.  Sounds like a good job to stay in shape!	agent_2:I am not sure of that, its probably hard on the joints walking the concrete floors all day.  But, they are getting more robotics.
131194	"agent_1:One of the greats LeBron James never even did March Madness.  He skipped college and went straight to NBA agent_2:Yeah, he's often considered the best player of all time. Do you know he signed a deal with Warner Bros. for a ""Space Jam"" sequel? agent_1:I heard that, Space Jam was the highest grossing basketball movie of all time.  I hope this next one is good too."	agent_2:Me too. I liked the first one, as well. Do you know that some of his high school games drew attendance of 1750 people with tickets costing between $100-120?
108467	agent_1:WOw that is a lot of money. Did you know they have a candy desk there? agent_2:A candy desk, what kind of candy do they have? agent_1:They have Mars, Jellybeans and Milky Way , all candy made in Pennsylvania	agent_2:Nice. Did you know Senator Thurmond spoke on the senate floor for 24 hours and 18 minutes without stopping?
29003	agent_2:Ha interesting! And maybe it is because he did not blink a lot. The faster blinker in presidential debates has lost every election since 1980! agent_1:Maybe they seem more nervous! It must be nerve wracking to have so many people watching you. And that's not even all of them either, like Astronauts vote from space somehow! agent_2:Nice! In Oregon they vote differently too, as all elections are conducted by mail there.	agent_1:Different places really do have such varied techniques it's crazy. I think in India, they have a polling booth in  forest full of lions, just for ONE voter!
4747	agent_1:Have you ever seen the movie Moneyball? agent_2:I saw it a long time ago agent_1:Ah I see. It was about Billie Bean managing the A's.	agent_2:Yes.  Do you know how many baseballs are used in a season?
48607	agent_1:I'm so glad to hear that he's giving back! I've never even seen The Decision. I'll have to check it out. agent_2:Yes, Lebron James has many accomplishments.  He won four NBA Most Valuable Player Awards and three NBA Finals MVP Awards. agent_1:I really admire Lebron, now that I think about it! He was born December 30, 1984. He's a year younger than me, and so much more accomplished!	agent_2:I didn't know this before but Lebron won his first NBA championship in 2012.
4844	agent_1:That's crazy! I don't even watch Judge Judy. Celebs make too much, I think. agent_2:Yeah I think we should put our priorities in different things not just celebrities. But some celebrities do good like that celebrity TV chef in Ethiopia who is trying to combat his countries hunger problem. agent_1:That's super interesting. Its crazy to think how much celebrities and pop culture influences our lives. There's this show called Game of Thrones that everyone is talking about.	agent_2:Oh yeah I love that show. I am so excited for the finale. There is even a National Geographic show that is like Game of Thrones except with lions.
131096	agent_1:I don't know they probably need money because of the Genius Bar LOL. What do you think about LeBron James? he's probably going to make a lot of money for being in the new Space Jam movie agent_2:Is that a sequel?  If it is, who was the main actor on the original one? agent_1:Yes it is a sequel. The original actor was Michael Jordan, I bet he will have a cameo in it though	agent_2:I see.  Thank you for the infor.  Lebron James is a good person.  He raised 6 M dollars for charity.
40465	"agent_1:Probably...  You never know, Ronald Reagan once didn't get a part because he didn't have ""that presidential look"".  The jokes on them... agent_2:It is sad that we stereotype presidents into certain looks. agent_1:I guess Obama blew the white guy stereotype.  That may be his biggest accomplishment in his 8 years.  I didn't know my trusty NES only displayed 54 colors?!"	agent_2:I did not know that either. It was nice talking to you.
96243	agent_2:Great, you sound like me!  Were you aware that George Strait and Jeff Bezos are cousins?  Isn't that just wild? agent_1:I wasnt aware of that. Who is jeff bezos again. agent_2:He's the wealthiest man in the world and Amazon founder.	agent_1:Oh. That is an interesting fact.
28006	agent_1:Yes, they could certainly spit fire and bust a rhyme. Were you a big fan? agent_2:Not a big fan but they certainly changed rap. Did you know that they had the first album to reach platinum status without airplay or a major tour? agent_1:They knew the beat of the street, the feel and appeal of the people in the hood. Anyway, great chat!	agent_2:Yes they were very successful. Great chatting with you as well.
79249	agent_1:Yeah, me either. I think it sort of sucks to be honest. LOL agent_2:poetry is one of those things you have to study in school for your own good. then you recover from the education and never read poetry again. agent_1:Yeah, I studied some ee cummings in school. Wasn't a fan. 	agent_2:Yes, the man with the typewriter with the broken shift key.
151176	agent_2:Yea I can see how theres only 11 minutes of gameplay in the nfl with how much time players take to get ready between plays agent_1:I also did not know that the nfl has no written rule against female players. agent_2:It will be interesting to see if there is every a female player as a place kicker since they can play by rule	agent_1:That would be interesting. Did you know engineers have a higher average life long earning?
94249	agent_2:They can be expensive I like to travel but Im usually broke so I dont do it often.  agent_1:They are really expensive. For example, in Japan every highway is a toll.  agent_2:Really? and do you know if tolls are expensive Im guessing they add up into a lot of money. 	agent_1:Yeah, it seems like a rip-off, but maybe their aggregate taxes work out similar.
79615	agent_1:You are correct. Off topic but do you use the telephone much anymore? agent_2:I have one, I don't use it as much as I used to, though. agent_1:Me either. I mostly text on the cell. Did you know that the cables that carry our internet and phone data across the ocean are only 2.7 inches around?!	agent_2:That's just wild and I hear they just lay them on the ocean floor.
151705	agent_1:Good morning to you! How are you today? agent_2:Hi, I'm fine. Still hard to believe Stan Lee is dead. I know he was 95 but just thought he'd be around forever. agent_1:He was a very talented man indeed! Can you believe that comics have some origins in 18th century Japan?	agent_2:I wonder how much those are worth considering how much old marvel comics are worth? Right up until the end he ended every phone conversation with excelsior.
3354	"agent_2:I didn't know that!  I know the tshirt was invented in 1904 and was marketed to bachelors who couldn't sew or replace buttons. agent_1:That would be the market I would have been in back then haha. I wish I would have invented the Ugg boots back then too haha. agent_2:Yes!  When we're they created?""  I think they have been around since the 1800's?"	agent_1:They were actually invented by surfers to keep their feet warm on the beach after surfing!
18986	agent_2:It was suggested by the judge because the comic featured a black character.  Awful! agent_1:Oh wow! That's why, I thought because the judge had an issue with science fiction. I wonder if that were to happen in today's society, what would happen? agent_2:Have you ever heard of the science fiction author Isaac Asimov?	agent_1:No I haven't, is there any notable books that he wrote or perhaps that was later adapted to a movie?
43798	agent_1:yea and if you're really good you can get the shoe deals like Michael Jordan. When the Air Jordan's first came out MJ was fined for wearing them in game agent_2:I bet that the league thought he had some sort of advantage. from a shoe. hm. not likely. plus the league wanted cash LOL agent_1:Yea and Nike was more than happy to pay Jordan's fines	agent_2:Yeah, cheap marketing and publicity. controversy is great for that.
143863	agent_2:Lol, no, I just thought they created video games. I wonder how much those playing cards they made are worth now agent_1:Yeah I think they are worth a lot of money. Did you ever play the Nintendo 64? There was a video game for it called f0x and it was the first racing game to run at 60 frames per second agent_2:Yea, I never knew F-zero X was 60 fps, I don't think people even cared about fps back then	agent_1:No I didn't even know that was a thing haha. But I did like that game, it was very fast, did you ever play a Pokemon game for the Nintendo?
146343	agent_2:that's true. Did you know NYC's area code is 212 because they are lazy? agent_1:On an old rotary phone that 212 would be easy to dial. It pays to be the Big Apple I guess. agent_2:did you ever have a rotary phone?	agent_1:Oh yeah, attached to the wall. Not much to it. Now an iPhone has more computing power than our nuclear arsenal.
147677	agent_2:I like sciences! And the fact that radio waves exist makes me think in who designed them. Must be someone really smart! agent_1:Yes, But now days people are social media very few only listen to radio. Its very useful to hear the current update in the cities. agent_2:Yes, I hope people could use more their imagination. When  someone listen to the radio he is impulsed to use the imagination instead of seeing the images like in television	agent_1:Jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by radio. Mostly i can be used any natural calamities to hear the news. It's Amazing !
102931	agent_2:Yeah that show was legendary. Ashton Kutcher was the man. It really did well in the US but not so much in the UK. agent_1:I remember watching that show on TV and wondering why they kids in my high school weren't nearly as cool as the one's on the TV show. I guess that's why it's TV. lol agent_2:Ha ha yeah exactly right TV is always cooler than real life. Thomas the tank engine had a lot of celebrity voices like Alec Baldwin. Are you familiar with that show?	agent_1:I do know that TV show, but my son was more into this other show called Tec The Tractor. It's pretty unique. I don't know another TV show like it. Have you seen it?
24531	agent_2:Black swallower, have heard of that one, but never caught one.   agent_1:I assume their very large fish. The seahorse is classified as a fish even though it has a neck.  agent_2:Yeah, seahorse are very cute little creatures.  Have you ever seen one up close?	agent_1:I have not. Did you know that 84% of genes known to be associated with human decease have counterparts in Zebrafish. I never heard of a zebrafish.
109499	agent_1:I used to watch a lot of 70's show, which I thought was great, but I just read that its apparently not very popular in England- it was cancelled after only 10 episodes agent_2:I guess Pokemon didn't have that issue of being cancelled. I read that it has over 750 episodes. That's a lot! agent_1:Thats crazy! I can't imagine how that show kept going for so long. I never really understood it haha I read that Thomas the Tank Engine had a pretty interesting cast, so maybe that explains why that one has lasted. Ringo star, Alec Baldwin and George Carlin have all narrated it!	agent_2:I think I'd prefer George Carlin narrating Thomas the Tank than John Legend's performance in Jesus Christ Superstar.
79186	agent_2:It's honestly like a humorous, dramatic greek comedy with how expensive cars are. agent_1:Yeah, the wear and tear can be tough. I don't drive a lot so, I don't see the expenses as much.  agent_2:Do you watch TV much? I love so many of the 100 cancelled comedy central shows and miss them.	agent_1:Now that is hilarious. I don't watch a lot of tv, I don't have the free time to be honest. What about you?
131145	agent_2:Good point. The NBA does have the best paid athletes if you look at their average annual salary. That is not including endorsements. agent_1:I would have thought football players make more. Apparently there were originally 2 major basketball leagues and then they merged in 1949.  agent_2:Well, the NBA is considered to be the premier basketball league in the world. American football is not played worldwide.	agent_1:Good point. Hey did you they are making a space jam sequel??
146936	agent_2:Do you have a famous clothing designer like shoes and shirts? agent_1:No , I just prefer colorful clothing like pilgrims. You? agent_2:I like Nike's shoes and I always like to purchase Polo shirts whenever I can afford them.	agent_1:Nice that is comfy. Nice chatting with you.
152251	agent_1:did you know that Tom Brady has never eaten a strawberry before? haha agent_2:How is that possible? He must have some sort of allergy or something. The Rams could sneak some strawberries in his water today! agent_1:haha they should! or maybe that's what leads to success in life, never eating strawberries! maybe it unlocks a superpower	agent_2:I wonder how today's SB will turn out for Brady and Belichick. Will it be a difference of 3 or 4 points again?
46616	agent_1:That is a lot!  Did you know it was founded by some students at the University of Virginia? agent_2:i had heard that! i wonder if they got any money from that, i dont think they still run it agent_1:I hope they did. They deserve it.  Do you ever vote on content?	agent_2:nah i dont really, i tend to just read stuff and keep to myself. a lot of people get really angry on there
95825	agent_1:My dog is super smart so she probably knows more than me haha. Dogs and elephants are the only animals that know pointing. agent_2:So, if we could get a chimp and your dog together, would they become a 1000 word knowing crime fighting duo, or just fling poo and bark a lot? agent_1:haha that's too funny. They definitely would fling poo and bark a lot because why not?	agent_2:I like the idea of the crime fighting duo using the subway.  They would clean up a lot of unguarded food.
85527	agent_1:Whoa.  I didn't know they were created that early.  I know Ford made the Model T in 1908, which was the first car available to the masses. agent_2:Yea, it's crazy that it took a while for other parts of the world to switch over from animal-drawn carriages agent_1:Speaking of the old days of cars...do you know how we came to call the back of a car a trunk?	agent_2:No, why?
27902	agent_2:If you define good as being able to hit the ball if it is slow enough, yes.  I probably should have been a soccer player since they make the most money as an athlete. agent_1:do they? I guess the ones in europe do agent_2:Oh yes they make millions.  I like basketball more though, I watch the NBA a bit.	"agent_1:do you think the new zealand team name of ""tall blacks"" seems a little racist?? I kind of do..."
31716	agent_2:It is a censorship thing. Well, we are lucky we have internet access to watch all the Netflix, since it is all internet now and no more DVD. agent_1:Yeah I am grateful it's not like that here, and we'd be screwed without access to Netflix since they've even begun replacing the TV networks with their own series. agent_2:I would love the job of just watching it and tagging the content into categories.	agent_1:Is that a real job? That would be fun.
45682	agent_1:Are you a fan of the NBA? agent_2:Yea, Klay Thompson is playing great, thanks to him the Warriors are outscoring their opponents by 10.5 net points agent_1:wow, that is a lot, I don't think recently though, they have been losing a lot. Kind of like lebron and the lakers...	agent_2:Yea Lebron was doing a lot better in Cleveland with Kevin Love, they had the second best assist rate
6271	agent_1:Yes to Walter Elias Disney, which is very fitting as he started the whole thing agent_2:Yeah it is fitting indeed. DO you use google a lot? agent_1:Yes I do, is the got to search engine for me. Do you know when it was founded?	agent_2:Yes in 1998 so it has been around for a while now and I am glad for it
127711	agent_2:You bring up a good point because I feel like that would backfire on the University of Iowa because it would make them want to play even harder. I wonder if the United States Senate has a lot of football fans? The Senate is the upper chamber of the United States Congress. agent_1:I like the candy desk. I'd be visiting it often. agent_2:Yeah I would not be able to lose weight if I work there. In 1988 a US senator invoked an obscure rule to allow the Sergeant at arms to arrest absent senators and bring them into the chamber for a vote. Sounds extreme to me.	agent_1:Yeah that does sound extreme. I herd one senator attempted to escape, but was caught and carried feet-first into the senate chamber by three officers.
75130	agent_2:Hi, I love Amazon and had no idea it dates back to 1994. agent_1:Yea, it is the 2nd largest online retailer in the world second only to Alibaba Group agent_2:Very cool. The first Amazon customer spent $27.95 and got a building named after him.	agent_1:That was nice of Bezos but I wonder why he built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years
10234	agent_1:I forgot that show existed. I had no idea she was on that. I'm sure she's a bit embarrassed about that now.  agent_2:Maybe, you know it's funny I love her music but she's not really what I'd consider typical to what I listen to. Then I find out her favorite band is Iron Maiden and it makes sense. agent_1:I didn't know about that either. I usually prefer rock as well but I'm not against some catchy pop here and there to get my day going or to work out to. It has it's place for sure. 	agent_2:I just wish she'd tour more. I have seen a few of her concerts but there are not that many opportunties.
72542	agent_1:No doubt!  If you publish a book in Norway, the gov't there will buy 1000 copies and distribute them to libraries throughout the country! agent_2:Haha I want to live in Norway now! Surprisingly more than half of adults in the USA have a library card. agent_1:That's pretty impressive that that many still have one in the internet age.  Are you a big tv fan?	agent_2:Agreed. Yes I love tv and tv series. I loved That 70's show with ashton kutcher. Can't believe they made a UK version.
5562	agent_1:Hello! How are you today? agent_2:I'm doing well how about you? agent_1:Not too bad either! Do you play any instruments at all?	agent_2:I do play the guitar. I heard that the piano is an acoustic instrument.
67305	agent_1:I believe it.  When I'm at work that's all everyone does at break time is watch youtube.  did you know police have their own youtube called blutube? agent_2:No, that's weird. Did you know Google created a network that watched 10 million clips on YouTube? And with all of the knowledge, it learned to recognize cats! agent_1:I didn't know that.  That's pretty incredible.  Do you know what a hamburger button is when you're surfing the net?	agent_2:I believe it's used in apps. It's the three horizontal menu lines.
715	agent_2:Game of Thrones author, George RR Martin, might not have cared for it.  Maybe Caesar would get a pass, but Martin doesn't care for fan fiction at all! agent_1:Yeah I heard he hated fan fiction, he doesnt care about it at all so changing the subject a bit do you use computers a lot? agent_2:It seems like that is what I do the vast majority of my day.  I'm not ready to upload my mind to a computer or memory stick like transhumanists, but it is like an extension of me some days.	agent_1:I agree theres so much we dont understand about the human mind, Transhumanist must be missing key elements of the human essence.
23850	agent_2:Yeah! Me too! No I have not heard of that. Does that mean he is a celebrity TV chef? I really admire those celebrities who use their status as a platform to promote good to society, like the old man who cooks for his village. agent_1:He's not really a celebrity in the traditional sense. Just a wealthy, retired contractor who is trying to help curb the hunger problem, by cooking more diverse foods. You should really check out his channel. agent_2:Oh wow! I will! I really enjoy watching shows related to cooking. I wonder how much he is able to make per video. Judge Judy makes over $120K per episode, making her the highest paid celebrity after Lebron James. I feel as if there are celebrities who get paid more than her though.	agent_1:Yeah, that doesn't seem right, as I remember reading somewhere that Hugh Laurie (House) received almost a million per episode.
52535	agent_2:You should get one, mine is my best friend, dogs are really smart agent_1:I need space for one. Don't have it right now. What kind of dog do you have? Do you know its blood type? agent_2:I have a golden retriever and I dont know, common blood lol no idea, are there many types?	agent_1:I heard that there are 12. I don't know them. There are blood drives for dogs.
19883	agent_2:I thought so too. It is kind of new. Did you know harry Truman did not want to go in the Dumbo ride when visiting Disneyland?  You know why? agent_1:Yes, he didn't want to be associated with the republicans. I didn't know Disney is related to the republicans? agent_2:I did not know that either, how is that?	agent_1:At that time maybe it was. I didn't think it's that way today? not really sure.
111402	agent_1:We would have a healthier planet that is a sure thing, do you like to travel? agent_2:I love to travel! What about you? agent_1:I love to travel as well, I want to go to Japan one day, have you been there before?	agent_2:I have not. I am going to go look into booking a trip now! It was nice talking to you.
233	agent_1:I do not even know how many zeros are in that number agent_2:lol, I know, I guess  the US have more tigers as pets than living wild in Asia. agent_1:and Roosevelet did not have any of them	agent_2:He did have a bear and hyena. Good to know you are a guardian not an owner in Colorado to pets.
82130	agent_2:I lived it... I was Fez... I hear they did a UK remake. Ever see that? agent_1:lol  I was going to ask you the same thing.  lol I haven't seen it. agent_2:Well, it was canned after only 10 episodes. Not too soon if you ask me. This world cannot survive with more than one Fez!	agent_1:lol  Did you know that there was only 1 episode of the Simpsons where Bart neither appeared or was mentioned?
136686	agent_2:Haven't seen that one yet. I think it's interesting that Germany gave animals legal rights. I wonder who represents the animals in court and how the judge decides. agent_1:Yes, me too, I didn't know that such a big portion of Nevada belongs to the Government, I thought that only Area 51. agent_2:I think there are a lot of military areas there. Maybe the military uses it for exercises.	agent_1:I have always wondered if the UFO's are military planes, haven't you?
113211	agent_2:Yeah it seems that way, its a Netflix film, do you watch a lot of TV? agent_1:Not as much as I do Netflix, do you? Even with over 750 episodes of Pokemon, I have yet to catch one of them, have you seen them? agent_2:Ive seen a couple of episode back when there were only 150 of  them, 16 years of Pikachu that seems like a lot	"agent_1:Never really jumped on the bandwagon for 70's show or ""Days Like These"" either, I wonder why the success for it in the US wasn't translated into the UK version, any ideas?"
63689	agent_2:Yes it is called Gaia, Tellus and Telluris agent_1:WOw that is cool. Jupiter has a moon that if it orbited the sun it would be a planet agent_2:Nice. The soviet union sent a spacecraft to Venus once	agent_1:Never heard of it, pretty cool. Did you know that Venus does not tilt?
44196	agent_2:Interesting. Sort of like on the East Coast, they have an island like that just south of Ocean City, MD.  agent_1:Interesting, I haven't heard of that one. Do you watch horror movies by the way? Apparently watching a horror movie can burn almost 200 calories agent_2:Interesting, I haven't seen any horror movies in a long time, but apparently E.T. was originally a horror movie. 	agent_1:Yeah that would have made a completely different movie in my opinion haha. Do you know the water phone is by the way?
142490	agent_1:Hi, how are you? agent_2:hey I'm good, can you guess how much Judge Judy makes per episode? agent_1:I am not sure? $25,000?	agent_2:well she makes like 120k per episode, thats insane! But she is good at her job haha
28183	agent_1:He really was. Almost as good as ronald reagan was. Do you know reagan once got rejected for a role because he didnt look presidential enough.  agent_2:That is too funny! I'm sure he was laughing when he won the presidential election at them! agent_1:Im sure whoever that director was felt like a real dummy. Lol. So did you ever have a nintendo?	agent_2:I agree! I played but not too much as a kid, I was a sega kid. How about you?
101373	agent_1:Sometimes I wonder if the people that created it took it seriously. I mean, the 3 horizontal line menu on apps and websites is called a hamburger button for example. agent_2:they probably did, Internet makes my life so much easier, I do most of my shopping on line, and I don't really read the full terms when buying an item. in fact only 7% people do. how about you? agent_1:I don't read them very much either, especially if they are from a well known company.	agent_2:Yeah they are often way too long , I just think it's not worth it.
93333	agent_2:Hello, Well there is something on the daily that can be upsetting! agent_1:I recently heard in the news that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has a leading choice to head the National Security Agency. Do you happen to know who this is? agent_2:No, who is he? I know the National Security Agency is very important, especially now!!	agent_1:Its Chris Inglis and from what I heard he is a very well respected intelligence professional.
162444	agent_2:That sounds embarrassing lol  agent_1:Yeah, that would be a nightmare. I don't think they would allow that today for the sportsmanship of the game. agent_2:Did you know theres only one left handed quarterback?	agent_1:I never knew that, wow. I had noticed that dance is similar to football in terms of being choreographed. Dancers like Bruce Lee used it in their film and enter competitions too.
146091	agent_2:The police were searching for him as he was wanted as a murder suspect. He found the cops one night and ambushed them.  But in the end, after more than a dozen bullets flew, Bennet was fatally shot!  agent_1:Why would he ambush cops? It seems that he got what he deserved. Had the cops done something to him? agent_2:They were hunting him because he murdered his girlfriend in the presence of their 3 year old daughter. So terribly sad. I heard about it over the radio. Do you like listening to the radio?	agent_1:I don't listen to the radio now much. I used to when I was young. Now i use the Internet. You?
1775	"agent_2:I watch it sometimes when Serena Williams is playing agent_1:yeah i like to watch her play. Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis by famous player rene ""the crocodile"" lacoste. i love their colgne for men agent_2:Intresting, the longest match played in a polo shirt was 22 hours"	agent_1:yeah if i recall it went over three days or so
21085	agent_1:Agreed. It did sort if humanize judges. Ha! Did you also see Justin Beiber's song Baby on YouTube? It's actually the most disliked song on the site! agent_2:I do not like Justin Bieber.  I like Youtube to find relaxing music for my cats. They seem to like Brahm's lullaby. I don't think they like rap! agent_1:That's awesome! Hey, if they ever want to see a good site with cop videos, the police have their own version of YouTube that's called Blutube.	agent_2:I think Youtube is very useful. I like TED talks and used them in school a lot. You can fins almost anything on it including how to cook a recipe. I sometimes like to see how something is done-like home repairs. It's good for that too.
138224	agent_2:Yeah that's weird. I think you could still project positivity even if you did a drama though, do you like the show House? Apparently Hugh Laurie makes like $700,000 episode agent_1:Yes that makes him the highest paid actor ever for a drama tv show!  That is a lot of money! agent_2:Absolutely! I wonderHow much money Michael Caine has? apparently he only started acting to meet girls haha	agent_1:Yes!  The prettiest girls are all in drama class!
130107	"agent_1:Nice.  I use this second largest search engine on the net to find all my favorite videos. But with 400 hours per minute, I'm falling behind! agent_2:ya I'll never be able to see it all, funny that netflix and youtube make up half of internet traffic though agent_1:Insane! But I'm not the best judge when it comes to YouTube... Apparently, I was the only person in the world that actually ""liked"" Justin Bieber's Baby video!"	agent_2:haha well I liked it too! I can't believe it is the most disliked video, that doesn't seem fair
83814	agent_2:I didn't either, its probably a good thing since there are a lot of hidden dangers in facebook but I also think that depends on local laws. agent_1:I also think it is a good idea. I'm sure many kids lie and find a way around it though. Myspace turned down an offer to buy facebook for $75 million in early 2005. What a disastrous business decision on their part.  agent_2:Yeah, I bet they are regretting it big time now although Facebook wouldn't be the same if they had bought it, who knows maybe it wouldn't exist nowadays.	agent_1:I actually preferred MySpace. It was more personalized and I didn't argue with people on it nearly as much ha ha. I also don't remember all of the memes passing around false information all of the time on MySpace.
135770	agent_1:Interesting. I wonder if people agent_2:Uh-oh looks like you got cut off there lol It's way cool that Jann Mardenborough was allowed to become a professional race car driver because he beat 90000 people in a video game agent_1:Yeah, oops! I was going to say, speaking of car jacking, I wonder if trunks were broken into a lot when they used to be wooden trunks on the back of cars.	agent_2:Oh yea, I didn't even think of that! Probably, gee! I hope no one kept valuables in their trunks then. Hopefully just some McD's they picked up! I had no clue drive thru's were invented for soldiers who couldn't get out of their cars. Thank you for your service & more!
37283	agent_1:Yes that's definitely different, also it's interesting to know that the first king to travel around the world was not from England, but rather it was the king of Hawaii agent_2:King of Hawaii would not have been my top guess. Like the US almost placing a UN flag on the moon instead of the American one. agent_1:Guess I don't know about that. I'm glad that they chose the United States flag. What do you think about the Highway tolls in Japan by the way?	agent_2:You know I'm not sure if that is a high amount or not. I have not traveled much by land so I can not be sure how it compares. What do you think?
131475	agent_2:haha ya I was surprised to see that, also surprised that President Banana is in charge of Zimbabwe haha agent_1:Haha, maybe he was elected by astronauts voting in space! Who would have thought of that? agent_2:haha who knows! also who knows why the guest house is bigger than the actual white house, that makes no sense!	agent_1:Yeah, very weird. Who knew that you could name a dumpster by voting--very weird.
141688	agent_1:Yeah,  just read it,  sounds like an amazing thing to do for children! agent_2:I wonder how many people can give up using their cell phone though. It's almost as addictive as heroin. agent_1:Yeah,  I hope they have support classes!	agent_2:The cell phone is the chief form of entertainment for most people. Did you know that the NES was discontinued in 2003? I thought they had stopped it long before.
88901	agent_2:Yes and ironically, the only losing coach there as well	agent_1:Yes. Coaches are still really highly paid in many of the States
101868	agent_1:lol ya I'm with you there, pretty crazy that netflix makes up about of third of internet bandwidth in north america agent_2:I know!  But I am still amazed that they spend 20 times more on postage than bandwidth!  Who still gets dvds in the mail????? agent_1:haha that's a good question! i haven't used a dvd in 10 years, did you know Blockbuster turned down buying Netflix back in the day?	agent_2:Yes!  They could have bought it for $50 million but turned it down!  Its worth $2 billion now!!!!!
10283	agent_2:Same here -- nice chat.  I sure won't be ballet...  agent_1:Hey, don't sell yourself short! Turkey ballet! agent_2:Hee. 	agent_1:CYA
137685	agent_1:Hmm I do not think so. How big is it? agent_2:It is huge. It can sit more than 18000 people and it cost $60 million agent_1:That is a lot of money and a lot of seats. Do you watch basketball too?	agent_2:I do actually sometimes. Did you know it was invented in the YMCA along with volleyball
146801	agent_1:That is a crazy amount of coverage, he must have been a monster when it came to selling ads.  agent_2:Yeah, he was hot--not as hot as that radio station that translates solar activity into sound and then broadcasts it--now that is one hot sound! agent_1:Isn't that crazy, I know you can also hear storms from Jupiter over am radio!	agent_2:That is probably as hot as Hanson music on alternative radio in Chicago...when they listeners are not told who they are listening to...Did yo hear about that one?
65343	"agent_2:True.  In 2007 Fox News tried to have a conservative version of ""the Daily Show"" called ""The 1/2 Hour News Hour"" but it was cancelled after 13 episodes. agent_1:That's pretty funny it got cancelled but I'm not surprised it got cancelled, Fox news creators Ailes and Nixon don't seem like funny people agent_2:Yeah, not only that but in 2015 the median viewer age for Fox News was 68 years old."	agent_1:Yet fox news is still watched more than cnn and msnbc combined
121527	agent_1:Really? I didn't agent_2:Yes quite surprising. If you like Bob Ross paintings you're in luck because youtube has 70 full episodes. agent_1:Of the process of him painting?	agent_2:Yep. All there if you want them. Do you watch TV too? I liked the Simpsons. In the first 400 episodes Homer had 188 jobs lol.
34371	"agent_1:Or Trojan wars, I wonder how many people went to see it if it only made $309 dollars at the box office agent_2:right! Maybe 30 lol! I wonder how bad it really was and if it can be found anywhere to watch. Do you like comedy films? agent_1:Yea, I really liked Kung Fu Hustle, Bill Murray though it was a ""Supreme Achievement"" in comedy"	agent_2:I have never seen that movie, was it really comedy gold?
124264	"agent_2:They are a little like the Grateful Dead.  I definitely like the, better, but it's like a couple songs only that I feel drawn to.  I guess I always thought Brian May was alright and I never knew that he constructed his guitar from an old fireplace and knitting needle! agent_1:fascinating! now that is being creative! with Queen, i liked some of the stuff but probably not a majority.  one group i always liked a lot, and i'm showing my age, was the Byrds which included David Crosby. agent_2:I think I only know their ""Turn"" song, but know lots of Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young.  I like the latter sparingly.  It might have been one of those seminal moments for growing up during that particular time though.  Maybe that is the allure for the Grateful Dead for some."	"agent_1:if you have a chance, just for the heck of it, try listening to some of ""byrds greatest hits.""  they did versions of many dylan songs but also did a lot of original material.  ""turn turn turn""certainly one of their bigger hits.  i love ""my back pages"""
123029	agent_1:It is very interesting to know. Development of telephone result in development of internet also. We use broadband width through the telephone lines only. agent_2:Did you know that there is no correlation between cell phone service and bars of service? agent_1:I can't understand it.	"agent_2:There is no connection between cell service and those ""bars"""
83798	agent_2:I hear he won a steve martin lookalike contest agent_1:I think you are right, I think that is initially how he got his break into show business.  agent_2:Ceasar used chickens for entertainment not food.	agent_1:Isn't that funny some of the things they used to do for entertainment way back then.
156257	agent_1:Do you like football? agent_2:I do, I like the Patriots. I miss having Benjarvus Green-Ellis on our team. He never fumbled in his time with the Patriots or the Bengals. agent_1:Did you espn invented the yellow line?	agent_2:I did, and I heard they won an Emmy for it!
60498	agent_1:Small yet influential?  I'm more a fan of their movies/shows than their shopping carts! agent_2:What shows do you watch through Amazon? agent_1:The wife loves Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, I like The Patriot - have you seen them?	agent_2:The girlfriend also loves Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. I'm not a huge fan. Haven't seen the Patriot, but I love Bosch and Man in the High Castle. Have you seen either of those?
147309	agent_2:That does not sit well with me , especially the part where they have to even leave mid meal agent_1:Nope I don't like it. I hope that not all teams are that way. I wonder why I've never heard about that before. Those poor cheerleaders agent_2:I know what discrimination, I think they might be the only team to do that though	agent_1:Yeah I hope so. Did you see that the NFL contract players using chips in their shoulder pads?
11467	agent_1:That gives promise that Mars could become sustainable for earth life.   agent_2:Would you go live on Mars ? - 81 Â°F is too cold for me.  agent_1:Id seriously have to bundle up.  I live in Florida, so it gets in the 20s here and I start to freeze.  	agent_2:Maybe it is something that will have all have to do, Earth has already lost 80 % of its natural forest.
32497	agent_2:We need more positive video games like minecraft! I read that the minecraft world is bigger than Neptune! Thats insane! lol. Definitely gives kids a large area to explore! agent_1:I agree! I think it' is an awesome game. I bet Amazon get a lot of orders for Minecraft ....such a huge love of kids and adults. agent_2:I bet minecraft is one of amazons best sellers for video games and kids toys! Some adults probably even collect the toys as well! Did you know that there is a combat side to minecraft? It has everything a different video game has, but even more!	agent_1:I am aware of all the aspects of Minecraft and it is amazing! I think that the founder of Amazon is brilliant, he is now the wealthiest man in the nation. They even own a publishing and film studio, just amazing.
82074	agent_1:Did you know Judge Judy makes $123,000 per episode? agent_2:No, That's alot!, Highest paid celebrity after Lebron James. agent_1:Hard to believe but Carol Burnett was the first celebrity to appear on Sesame Street.	agent_2:I know, so long ago!  Eating diverse foods combats hungry problems. Great chat!!
151751	agent_1:Wow nice rule. Did you know the guest house is larger than the white house agent_2:Wow nice. Lincoln was the first president to have a picture taken at his inaguration agent_1:Cool. DO you know how the VP used to be elected?	agent_2:Hmm not sure. Did you know 5 presidents have lost even though they won the popular vote?
45744	agent_1:Hah! Did you know Air Jordan's were initially banned by the NBA but Jordan just wore them anyway? agent_2:Do You know why did they banned them ? Was he too high ? ;) agent_1:DOn't know for sure. Nike just payed his fine every night he wore them. Nice marketing.	agent_2:it sure is ! It's nice to have a company like Nike to pay fines for You ;)
133513	"agent_2:I wouldn't be surprised if he wasn't that high in the list honestly. WOuldn't mind staying in the President's guest house though. agent_1:Yeah that would be awesome and crazy to think it's even bigger than the White House! agent_2:I feel like we need to give our president's better nick names. The 1st president of Zimbabwe was nicknamed ""President Banana""."	agent_1:Haha classic! It's quite interesting that there hasn't been a US president who wasn't a republican or democrat since 1853!
3151	agent_1:Did you know that some of the symbols and written scripts used in the movie were based on actual script dating back to the 4th century? agent_2:Yea, based on Nsibdi from the Nigeria region agent_1:I think that is very cool, I always like it when those types of movies use actual history references. 	"agent_2:Yea but it's unfortunate that they censored the phrase ""praise hanuman"" from the indian release of Black Panther"
111817	agent_1:Really, for what? agent_2:I believe Kobe Bryan won an Oscar for an animated film that he made of his basketball career agent_1:Oh wow good for him, he seems so talented	agent_2:Yea but a lot of people are upset at the Oscars due to the all the issues with sexual harrassment
128527	agent_1:No I never heard about that, I wonder how he gets paid or he must just do it pro bono. agent_2:Not sure lol. Did you know there is a jellyfish that is immortal? agent_1:Yeah I think I have heard about that, they claim to put it in pills now to help memory. 	agent_2:Yep. Pretty cool. Apparently, it's cells always regenerate.
48865	agent_1:Maybe, but that's risking getting dog hair on the mattresses. Some of the pods even have bedtime stories you can listen to. I guess they really do want customers to have the full experience agent_2:Anything to make that sale! Do you ever shop at Target? agent_1:On occasion, but I might go there more often now that I know they will price match Amazon!	agent_2:That was something that I did not know. I also did not know that Vermont is the only state without a Target.
9485	agent_2:Yeah, it is a complex instrument. it has a lot of moving parts.  agent_1:I want to see the piano used by both Freddie Mercury and Paul McCartney sometime! That would be awesome. agent_2:I bet there is some magic in those keys. You could write a hit song! Anyway, great chat!	agent_1:I hope so lol. Great chat as well, have an awesome night!
53005	agent_2:and how did Wikileaks published the government's plans to destroy wikileaks. thats too funny agent_1:Is there anything wikileaks doesn't know? lol agent_2:Thats google for you. They control everything with Jeff Bezos.	agent_1:Ha, ha ha, I know! Interesting Amazon owns Imdb.
97550	agent_1:that is crazy, I think they have dog blood drives where you can bring your dog to donate blood, I just think that's weird because a dog can't really give consent to give blood agent_2:I guess its all up to the owner then, my dog is afraid of needles so I wouldnt do that to him. agent_1:ya, I'm afraid of needles too haha, did you know that Stephen King was terrified of the movie bambi when he first saw it as a kid?	agent_2:Wow thats surprising as he is like the king of horror movies, I guess Bambi is scarier than what I thought
58058	agent_1:I cant say Im with you there, I dont care too much to be scared. agent_2:Yeah not everyone is i just like that Youtube offers horror movies! agent_1:It is really cool!  There is something for everyone, even for people who like Justin Bieber.	agent_2:Yep, that is even how he got noticed was through youtube!
115176	agent_1:I need to hear this rap album made by the two twins from Japan at 100 years old.  Sounds hilarious.  I am learning a lot about Japan today! agent_2:I hope to be able to speak still at that age! agent_1:Absolutely let alone make a rap album!  Impressive.  Did you ever listen to Straight Outta Compton?	agent_2:I did not
25445	agent_2:Literally any item that could hit a ball over the net, I suppose. A bat would've been hilarious to see! Imagine a tennis ball flying over the net at 50mph. The helicopter trick sounds brilliant! That's a lot of fuel to burn through, though.  agent_1:The would have been wild. They should reinstate that rule. I'd like do see someone come in with a loaf of hero bread. That would be entertaining to watch. Everyone has gotten so serious and is always offended these days. We always looked to sports as a form of entertainment but now it's so political. agent_2:I agree. It's nice to have your voice heard, but why should they be heard louder than the average person? Oh well... On a brighter note, did you know that George Clooney had a pet potbellied pig?! His name was Max. Apparently George treated him like a dog. He let him sleep in the bed with him and everything. I wonder if the pig was smelly... 	agent_1:If I had a pig, I'd probably treat it like a dog too. They are very smart and very clean animals, despite popular though. George Clooney is actually a distant relative of Lincoln too.
144734	agent_2:Yeah they are, that is very interesting and ultra modern.  agent_1:Yep that's for sure. Do you like Animals by the way? What's your favorite one? agent_2:I do really like animals and nature in general.  I don't think I have a favorite though, maybe the sloth.  How about you?	agent_1:Slots are awesome! I really like dogs myself, it's shocking to think that there are 20 quintillion individual animals on Earth right now, that's insane!
133403	agent_2:oh wow interesting but that sounds annoying haha, did you notice that airports put luggage claim farther from the travellers now? So instead of making it faster you just have to walk farther haha agent_1:Maybe that will be less waiting time for luggage. I wonder how much, if any, luggage King Kalakaua took on his venture around the world. He was the first king to travel like that agent_2:thats cool! Do you watch tv btw? like have you ever seen Shark Tank?	agent_1:I've seen a few episodes of that show, and I've always wondered what happens to people after they make a deal
103897	agent_1:ya that makes sense, I guess he rejected a 10million dollar offer from reebok when he was eighteen, that takes a lot of balls especially for being so young agent_2:It was smart, though. Apparently he landed an offer for nine times that much from Nike soon after that! agent_1:haha that's true so I can't feel too sorry for him, 90 million dollars is a lot of money for a 19 year old kid!	agent_2:I think 90 million dollars is a lot of money for anyone! Except maybe someone like Jeff Bezos.
130156	agent_2:I have heard about it and listened to Radiolab podcast about it. There were actually like three others. One in Latin America so infuriated the people, they burned the radio station down when they were told it was a hoax. agent_1:Interesting. Do you listen to Youtube?  agent_2:I use youtube to learn how to cook and fix stuff around my house. WHat about you?	agent_1:I watch it all the time, for videos, instruction stuff, all sorts of things to be honest.
18803	agent_1:I always enjoy reading about people's idea of a dream day. Sometimes it gives me ideas of things to do. agent_2:That is an interesting article, so many things to do at the D.C area agent_1:Yeah, most of it didn't sound fun to me but the menu ideas sounded amazing.	agent_2:I agree, have you been to the D.C area before?   I would like to go to the Natural History Mesuem, that seems like a great place
59208	agent_2:That's interesting that they only drink through their skin. That would be an interesting trait for a human. Apparently, humans are the only mammals that cannot breathe and swallow at the same time. agent_1:That would be a callange. Here is another challenging puzzle: the black swallower fish can eat prey ten times it's own weight. The trouble is, black swalower fish don't know how to weigh themselves... agent_2:The Black Swallower fish is essentially approaching infinity! That is a large amount! Speaking of large amounts, if you consider the entire history of earth as a 24 hour period, human history would only make up 1 minute and 17 seconds.	agent_1:And since humans lost their body hair 240,000 years ago, they have been embarrassed for over a minute.
121838	agent_2:I think it is but I am not sure. How about Thomas the Tank? agent_1:I have not seen that one. Any good? agent_2:I have seen them with my niece and it is fun for them. Alec Baldwin did the voice for about 52 episodes	agent_1:Nice! It was nice chatting with you?
70092	agent_1:Do you like the universe? I think the sun is interesting, it's the perfect sphere of hot plasma! agent_2:Hi I do like the Universe since I am a part of it.  lol  You must be talking about the sun? agent_1:Yes exactly! Actually the sun is white but only perceived yellow because of atmospheric scattering.	agent_2:I never knew that.  I do know that a lightening bolt is hotter than the surface of the sun!
51202	"agent_2:haha ya I could see that, I haven't seen any movies he's been in, unlike Bill Murray who I""ve seen almost all of his movies hah agent_1:Seems like you are a big fan of Bill Murray? agent_2:ya I love him in Ghostbusters and Groundhog day, have you seen those movies?"	agent_1:I have, those are classics, I love them,
164568	agent_2:That's an impressive feat for just a season, let alone a whole career! agent_1:I agree!  In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars of the day.   agent_2:That was before ESPN came up with the nifty yellow first down line though. That's worth an Emmy, if you ask me	agent_1:I agree!  It comes in handy when we're watching the actual 11 minutes of live gameplay per game.
3699	agent_1:Apparently google prefers dogs to cats. agent_2:Then I wonder if employees can bring their dogs to work every day? agent_1:Apparently they've even written it into their code of conduct.	agent_2:Well I guess Google simply acknowledges that dogs are man's best friend
132023	agent_1:Yeah?  I'd like to go to one, take my dogs to donate blood. That would be cool. agent_2:The dogs should get tons of treats for being such good dogs. google should have blood drives for them. agent_1:That would be a great idea!  Isn't Google a dog company?	agent_2:google is a dog company, and rightly so. i approve. everybody likes a dog, and dogs help reduce stress.
40617	agent_2:Hello agent_1:Hi, do you like dogs? Do you have a dog? What do you know about dogs? agent_2:I like dogs but I am allergic	agent_1:Did you know that dogs have 12 different blood types? And that there are blood drives?
91173	agent_1:He must have, if he danced ballet. Michael Jackson being so popular for his dance moves even had a patent on it. agent_2:Tupac as a ballet dancer. Not really the image I had of him. MJ knew he was on to something, so he protected it. agent_1:Yeah for sure. Babies apparently dance when they hear music and smile when they hit the beat.	agent_2:Hey man, it's been great chatting!
115621	agent_1:I knew there were a lot, but not that many! I know they do actually have blood drives for dogs, which is sweet. agent_2:That is sweet. Istanbul has vending machines that dispense food and water to stray dogs in exchange for plastic bottles. agent_1:It's hard to believe that we don't have those in the US. Did you know that dogs and elephants are the only animals that seem to instinctively understand pointing.	agent_2:I did not know that about dogs and elephants. They must be pretty smart animals.
11274	agent_2:I actually have heard that before and wondered why we are not studying jellyfish more to find out how and why that is possible. Could we use that to our benefit in any way I wonder?  agent_1:I do not know,  I just seen it on Blue Planet on Netflix lol maybe their organs do not age after a certain poing lol  agent_2:Maybe. I would really like them to find out more about that. Did you know that a seahorse is the only fish with a neck?	agent_1:Yeah that is interesting!  Some fish look like they have necks though lol so they have necks and can carry a baby good for them.
2962	agent_1:Hey, you a fan of any sports involving hitting balls with sticks? agent_2:Many such games fit that description.   Golf is one I enjoy. agent_1:I like golf a lot. It's a real shame how much water is wasted per day on each course, though. It's over 300,000 gallons a day a course!	agent_2:True, but consider that golf courses in America combined are larger than the size of two small US states!
138952	agent_1:Definitely.  I know I don't want my son playing it! agent_2:It was probably more newsworthy since Feb was Hockey is for everyone month agent_1:Every month has so many things, hard to keep track.	agent_2:I had no idea dunking was banned in college basketball for a decade
26013	agent_1:I wonder if the Loch Ness monster (assuming Nessie is real) has both gills and lungs? agent_2:I'm not sure but I do know that under the provisions of the 1912 Scottish protection of animals act, the Loch Ness monster is a protected species. agent_1:Cool.     I am a fan of animals, particularly those with white spots on their forehead.	agent_2:Yes, me too. I've never seen an animal with white spots on their forehead but it's been nice chatting with you.
142893	"agent_2:I also loved the dark side of the moon. I listen to it all the time after all these years. agent_1:That is a great album, crazy how it was one of the best selling albums of the year 2014 agent_2:Do you like TV ?There are over 750 episodes of ""pokemon."" I have not seen not one episode."	agent_1:I have and used to like the show, I watched it when it got premiered like 16 years ago, Pikachu is still the best
140729	agent_2:I did, it was one of my favorite shows.  Did you know homer has had over 188 jobs? agent_1:I had no idea.  I always remember him working at the Nuke plant for some reason. agent_2:Same here, I think he worked for Duff at some point too.	agent_1:That's right! hahaha I bought a duff beer can that was full of jellybeans a few years ago for a christmas stocking.  Did you know that there was only 1 episode where Bart wasn't it nor was even mentioned?
46659	agent_2:Could imagine if one of our presidents released an album that would be crazy! agent_1:What would even be crazier would be if the music was actually good agent_2:Yeah that would be pretty wild. Did you know that Ricky Gervais was a pop singer before he became a comedian? That's hard for me to imagine.	agent_1:Well I'm happy he is a comedian now. Do you follow any other people like Ricky Gervais or Lady gaga?
20818	agent_1:Legos are cool unless you step on them in the middle of the night barefooted. The are a quality product with only 18 out of 1000000 being bad.  agent_2:Well anybody who has stepped on one in the middle of the night sure does know about that quality huh. They dont give any. I heard that lego is investing millions to switch away from oil based plastics. Its nice that they are going environmentally friendly. agent_1:Yeah, since they make soooo many.  If they were divided among all the people in the world, each person would have 86 Lego bricks. 	agent_2:Well we have a couple hundred peoples worth at my house then.
53032	agent_2:I would imagine as they all but vanished in facebooks rise. agent_1:Yeah, Facebook has grown so much. In its initial public offering in 2012, it was valued at 104 billion, the largest ever valuation for a newly listed public company agent_2:I am a big dancer how about you?	agent_1:No, I am too self conscious. I used to dance when I was a kid though-tap and ballet.
140960	agent_2:There are a lot of odd sounding french words in Detroit. They make my head hurt. agent_1:Especially the founder of Detroit who has Cadillac named after him! Anyways, great chatting with you! agent_2:Yes, Antoine De La Mothe Cadillac was a cool guy. Later.	agent_1:Have a good one!
45174	"agent_1:Also a judge rapped her ruling over a suit filed against Eminem agent_2:Not sure I like that.  Seems like she was throwing it in his face a bit.  Maybe if she did it in sign language like ""Signmark"" who is a deaf rapper who raps in sign language. agent_1:yeah, how about two identical twins 100 years old putting out a rap album"	agent_2:That's crazy.  I wouldn't buy it.  I'd rather listen to Aerosmith, even if they have made more money from Guitar Hero than any of their albums.
21116	agent_2:Agreed. Sure, I can order online, but I prefer to try clothes on! Only 60% ever feel and look - right. You know?	agent_1:Yep, i like to try on my clothes you never know how they will fit even from Macy's.
85189	agent_1:THat's so crazy to imagine. So much money. Zuckerburg used blue as the main color on the site because he suffers from colorblindness.  agent_2:I never knew that!  I can't believe it's been around 15 years already since he founded the company in 2004. agent_1:Wow. I still remember opening my account. Seems like yesterday. Iceland is rewriting their constitution through Facebook so the public can make changes and suggestions.	"agent_2:That's pretty neat.  Facebook's ""like"" button is illegal in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein.  I wonder why?"
79380	agent_2:For sure, I like how Netflix can be watched on TV or computer, ever watch south park> agent_1:Do you tend to watch shows or films? agent_2:I love them equally, depends on my mood, how about you?	agent_1:I tend to watch movies lately. Do you have any favorite genre?
114491	agent_2:Yes, he was one of the first big name guys to take on voice acting. Shame about him. agent_1:That bummed me out when I heard about it.  I loved all the different roles he played and his stand up act was good too. agent_2:Yes he truly was gifted. I guess it's kinda funny I was somewhat complaining about celebrities taking voice actors jobs. Nowadays so many celebrities want to enter politics.	agent_1:No doubt!  It's kind of funny.  Obviously, there is Trump and Reagan.  But there's been a lot of others...Arnold (gov. of CA).  Clint Eastwood was a mayor.  I remember Sonny Bono was maybe a mayor too?
24753	agent_2:Is this something you know a lot about? I really do not get too interested in the universe and that topic. It either goes above my head or bores me. I want to read that book to see if it changes anything in me. What about you? agent_1:I am very interested in knowing the universe. But it knows little about it. agent_2:Well, I read the universe tends to be opaque.	agent_1:Of course, The mere fact that we live in a universe boggles my mind every once in a while.
150349	agent_1:Interesting. Do you game now? I was looking at buying a system.  agent_2:I dont.  Still have ym OG NES. agent_1:Nice. Did you know that in the 60s bowlers made twice as much as top football stars?	agent_2:I heard that, that is pretty crazy.  But the real money is in Engineering.
92236	agent_2:Me too I love it. BBC once played piano tunes instead of the news agent_1:I am sure it was more interesting that day lol. Speaking of BBC, I saw that some climbers on Britains highest mountain found a piano at the top agent_2:Yes, I wonder who managed to put it up there though	agent_1:Right and what their thinking was lol! It was so nice chatting with you!
20581	"agent_2:I am and that's pretty cool. I know there are 12 different blood types for dogs and that they can donate.  agent_1:That is crazy! I've been reading a lot about dogs lately but I did not know that. Obviously humans have had dogs around a long time but I'm surprised they are the first domesticated. I would have thought cats. agent_2:Did you know google is a ""dog"" company.  It's even in their code of conduct. "	"agent_1:Yes! When I googled information on dogs that came up! I guess because dogs perform so many roles for humans. They are more like ""man's best helper"" then just ""friend""."
112685	agent_1:Sure. Grandfather had the town's 1st Model A Ford. Long, long time ago. Cars helped small town America get paved roads. agent_2:I guess they helped us move forward at big steps, funny how the trunk of cars got the name agent_1:Yes. Grandpa's Model A had a real wooden trunk in the back. 	agent_2:So cool your granpa had one of those models, did you hear about that pro driver that became pro by beating 90,000 people
6439	agent_1:Yeah and I guess the records began being kept in 1988, so who knows what it was before that.  agent_2:Yeah, I guess 1998 is considered the modern era. Before that teams didn't watch stats too closely. agent_1:That is crazy, that doesn't see that long ago.  I'm sure there are all kinds of crazy records before then. 	agent_2:Cy Young apparently won 435 games, now 200 is considered incredible.
140082	agent_1:Haha yeah hopefully they have a good backup LOL. I like knowing that they have 3D cell service at the top of Mount Everest. That way I can do a selfie or SnapChat up there haha agent_2:It's amazing how far the internet has spread. We've come a long way. Everyone is connected in some way...and you never know when you might be teaching the next famous person agent_1:No you're right! Have you seen what a hamburger button is online? It's that button that looks like three horizontal lines. They have it everywhere period. And the name makes me hungry	agent_2:back to hamburgers! i love it. You can hope in your cadillac and get one at the drive thru in mcdonalds and thanks Karl Benz and Antoine de la moth Cadillac for the privilege
12561	agent_1:Yeah it was this guy who spent less than $30 and got a building named after him. agent_2:Yeah that is awesome. do you use your computer much? agent_1:I do all the time actually. Mine runs on a bigger ram than the space shuttle one	agent_2:Haha true story, 1 mb of ram is nothing nowadays. Russians once made a computer that ran on water
47003	agent_2:Yeah, I dunno how that would work.  I tell ya, you gotta be in GOOD shape to play soccer, they say a player runs an average of 7 miles per game!  I get tired just thinking about it.  HAHA! agent_1:Really!  I am winded from adjusting my seat cushion... I hear Jon Stewart was an accomplished player. agent_2:Yeah, I think he represented US in a big game.  Can't recall which one though.  Even more awesome player to me though is Didier Drogba.  He singlehanded stopped a civil war in his home country! 	agent_1:He must have quite a leg on him to kick the butts of an entire nation!  Another noteworthy player is German Mezut Ozil, who donated winning from the Olympics to help Brazilian children.
140067	agent_2:Yes, I do drive a car! I didn't realize that the first car was patented by a German man, Karl Benz agent_1:Yes and he later became part of the company Mercedes-Benz. Hard to believe the Model T was created back in 1908. Genius agent_2:That was over 100 years ago. It's crazy how far cars have come since then. If you live in South Africa, you can even attach a flame-thrower on your car so it doesn't get carjacked! 	agent_1:That's awesome! I would totally make burgers or something with that flamethrower LOL but I also probably would not go to South Africa
101247	agent_1:Maybe because you have to dial 1 before the area code or something.  agent_2:Could be, too confusing for people. I didn't know Unicef donates a day of clean water to a child in need from unused  cell use. agent_1:Yeah amazing donation,  I hope they get a lot from me,  I dont use my cell phone that much!	agent_2:I use mine somewhat, but not like some people I know. Interesting smoking near apple computers voids the warranty by making it a biohazard!
25587	agent_1:I don't know. They must be smart enough to steer clear of the danger. Maybe they stayed with the horses at the fire. agent_2:I wonder when people started putting clothing on animals though. Clothing serves many purposes from protection to appeal agent_1:I guess they want to make their pet look like a little person. Cute and stuff. I understand that animals can get cold, so clothing could help. Still, people can go overboard.	agent_2:Well clothing has a very interesting history. Did you know people used to do laundry in old faithful the geyser?
27382	agent_2:Yeah I think so too. I also loved Kareem Abdul Jabbar. His dunk was crazy. agent_1:Me too, he was a famous Laker also like Kobe. His dunk was banned for like 10 years in college it was so crazy agent_2:Yeah such a cool thing to brag about. I went to Australia once, and the nearby country New Zealand, calls their team the tall blacks!	agent_1:yikes, that would not fly over here! I wonder if their supreme court has a basketball court also
24166	agent_2:No, not often.  I am aware they have many uses though.  The military developed a boot that can be used in temperatures almost 60 degrees below zero. agent_1:Have you heard of Ugg boots?  I guess they were invented by surfers to keep their feet warm after surfing.  I was surprised at how cold in water was in S. CA. agent_2:Yeah, that is smart.  I would like to go hiking more, I haven't been in decades, and I know I will need boots for that.	agent_1:Same here but I have my old boots... Maybe you can buy them from Apple if they start making clothing again like they did in 1986.
147075	agent_1:They started in 1919! agent_2:The Quarterback position is often abbreviated as QB.  He's considered the 'leader'. agent_1:The circular huddle used in todays american football was created by paul d. hubbard, a deaf quarterback, so the other team could not read his hand signals.	agent_2:You know, a woman could be QB as there is no written rule in the NFL barring women players.
99218	agent_2:You would think that a player that shot free throws Granny Style would get lots of attention.  Then become a Celebrity.  Earning that player stupid money. agent_1:Successful carriers in sports and entertainment is commonly associated with the celebrity status. The political leader is become celebrity if they are popular in News. agent_2:I think I understand.  Cheryl Miller played high school ball and was a top player.  Better than her brother Reggie.  But Cheryl never achieved celebrity status.  No fame, no money.	agent_1:Robin williams american actor and comedian, he also do stand-up comedy also. First actor to start the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films.
10888	agent_2:Gonna have to remember that one.  And maybe shave my dog's head to see if she has a white patch on her forehead!! agent_1:really?  I don't know if i buy into that! agent_2:Thats one for google.  All my dog and cat lover friends I think I'll starting calling them ailurophiles or cynophiles and see the looks they get on their faces.	agent_1:Well... i would surely give you a look of what the....  Funny the first cloned animal was a cat and they named it copy cat!
54310	agent_2:As a kid, I always thought ballet was the most serious. Some professional ballerinas go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week. I wonder how they afford that on a dancer's salary? agent_1:I know considering they do not get paid much. Tupac was also a ballet dancer agent_2:I guess it makes sense that musicians would need to be good dancers in the age of the music video. Michael Jackson had a patent on some kind of device that let him lean over really far when he danced.	agent_1:So cool, I wonder if it is still around, that device. did you know babies spontaneously dance to music?
66693	agent_1:That is a lot. Did you know the motivation for Michael cane to go to drama class? agent_2:He wanted to be in class with the prettiest girls. Well, guess it worked out for him! agent_1:Did you know about Rger Dankins?	agent_2:I don't really know of his work.
149424	agent_1:Most of that income comes from the advertising on the site.   agent_2:Yeah, it is interesting that FB even allow marijuana advocacy and education in advertising on their site. agent_1:I find that they are pretty progressive with some of their policies.  Then sometimes they reject before and after fitness ads because they feel it is targeting people improperly.  lol	agent_2:Yeah, and it seems that sometimes brand ads relating to marijuana get shut down unexpectedly on social media. FB and Instagram don't allow promotion of marijuana sales even though they allow information, not connecting to a product for sale. Seems like that's a tricky space to navigate.
29951	agent_2:I hadn't really heard of the Warriors before Curry came along. He helped them return to the finals in 2017 and 2018. agent_1:Yes he did! Curry is a good guy too he donates mosquito nets to Africa for each 3 pointer he makes he donates 3 nets...pretty cool! agent_2:I just learned that the Warriors were founded in Philadelphia.	agent_1:Cool! Also, LeBron James and Curry are both from Akron Ohio, funfact there!
30361	agent_2:well its interesting because even though he is amazing and was the 2015 mvp, he was only the 4th highest salary on the team agent_1:The 4th highest salary! wow! I though he was the best paid player, he is the best in the team so that would make sense agent_2:ya for sure, funny too that he didn't get any scholarship offers, I wonder if he wasn't that good out of high school or if they overlooked him	agent_1:Maybe I wonder if he attended college then?
91408	agent_1:I love old Charles Chapplin movies, that was some good silent comedy, you know that Reagan was once  rejected for a role of President because they didnt though he had the presidential look, thats really ironic agent_2:Hahaha, really? That's funny! I find it interesting that the comedy tv show 3RD Rock From The Sun won a golden globe over Seinfeld...Friends and Frasier. Crazy!  agent_1:3rd Rock from the Sun beat those other shows? I wonder if the jury got paid lol, the show isnt that good.	agent_2:I agree! I heard that Bill Nye....Science Guy.....got a break into entertainment by winning a contest! Haha...lucky!
97557	agent_2:Hey, Yes I have. It is one of my favorite shows. agent_1:I have never seen it, only just heard of it.  The are so many DC and Marvel shows on now. agent_2:There are! In fact, Morena Baccarin who voices a character on the Flash has been in 3 different super hero shows and movies.	agent_1:I guess the Flash has the ability to move very quickly, anything else?
23980	agent_2:He was a wordsmith of the highest order. I wonder how he got the talent. was his family good with words? agent_1:I can't say. Some people are just pure genius. So every time you say a phrase like Good riddance. Laughing Stock. Wild Goose Chase or As luck would have it, you can thank William Shakespeare.  agent_2:Yes, he took english 1.0 and made it english 2.0. he set the stage for an expansion of the language unlike any other.	agent_1:I am a fan of Shakespeare as you can tell but not as big a fan as other. Polish composer Andre Tchaikowsky donated his skull to the Royal Shakespeare company in hopes it would be used as a prop.
145788	agent_2:Thats a great thing I guess, the internet is neccesary now I cant imagine my life without it agent_1:I know.  There is even 3G service at the top of MT Everest. agent_2:Theres signal on top of Mt. Everest! wow thats the highest mountain in the planet, crazy how signal gets there	agent_1:Yeah, but it is great so you can check in when you reach the summit, because as we all know it isnt official until it is on facebook... lol
7125	agent_1:I'm so ready for daylight savings time and longer days. Did you know that when the Earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long? agent_2:interesting, lets talk about the planets more. Most planets spin around the run but uranus rolls around it.  agent_1:That's interesting. Did you know that Jupiter's moon Ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun.	agent_2:i did not, there is a planet 455 light-years away that might have the building blocks of life
53140	agent_2:HOw are they doing this year? good? agent_1:They are a couple games below 500 right now, it's a rebuilding year for sure. agent_2:Ok, they'll get it together. Anyway, great chat! Have a great day!	agent_1:You as well, take care!
96534	agent_1:I heard that, Linkin Park is pretty amazing. agent_2:Yeah, I wish I had gotten to see them live.  It's sad what happened to Chester Bennington though... :( agent_1:It is.  It really puts the importance of mental health in the public eye.  	agent_2:Speaking of albums with staying power... Dark Side of the Moon was a best seller in 2014 despite being released 40 years ago.  That blows my mind!
113825	agent_1:Exactly! I wonder if the president wears the same types of clothing when he plays golf. agent_2:I have seen video of him playing in regular golf clothes.  He owns a bunch of 18 hole courses which is the standard length. agent_1:True. I think most golfers have the same type of clothes while playing. I have never played golf, have you?	agent_2:Yes.  Years ago when the Yellow Pages was still a big business, I had to play for business purposes.  Some courses here have closed due to the cost of water.  A course in Dubai uses 4 million gallons of water per day!
155245	agent_2:By choice or some other reason. I do know that the president of Indonesia has 3 pop albums. Can you imagine trump singing pop?  agent_1:Not at all. lol. Until the year 1805, the runner up in an election was automatically made VP? agent_2:Wow, Obama and McCain or Hillary and Trump? Sounds like the makings of an even more interesting reality show. 	agent_1:I agree!
47073	agent_1:yeah they are good at that. if they live to 15, they would have slept for 10 of those years agent_2:wow that is wild, what is sad though is white cats are like 85% likely to be both deaf and have blue eyes agent_1:yeah, I had a white persian once and she was deaf, but so gorgeous	agent_2:oh nice, ya I always had dogs, would you ever own a glow in teh dark cat? I guess they exist
125036	agent_1:Interesting, I don't think that is true though. But I know that MJ wanted to build a 50 foot moon walking robot.  agent_2:Wow.  That would be interesting.  What was he going to use it for? agent_1:I'm not sure, to roam the desert sands of las vegas I think. Weird. 	"agent_2:That would have been a sight to see.  ""Hey look kids...."" lol  Changing subjects... Do you know much presidential history?"
135886	agent_1:More than i should, You? agent_2:Not as much anymore. I am more on the internet. I look up any TV that I'm interested in. I still have cable but rarely use it.  Homer Simpson held 188 jobs in 400 episodes! lol agent_1:Wow that's a hard working cartoon character. Yeah i dropped cable mostly just watch Hulu and Netflix. I hear there an episode were Bart not in it. Is that right? 	agent_2:Yes, I heard that too. lol, I'm not surprised most deals on Shark Tank are never enacted! Good chat!!
76968	"agent_1:It certainly is. Add to that fact, most of the content on You Tube is uploaded by individuals, the BBC, Hulu, and Vevo. And if you register on You Tube you have more options than unregistered users. agent_2:True.  The most disliked youtube video is Justin Bieber's ""Baby"".  I think that's more of a cultural backlash of people who weren't fans of his rather than people truly not liking the video. agent_1:I agree with that. Another interesting fact is that the police actually have their own youtube called bluetube, where they share law enforcement videos. "	agent_2:That has a nice ring to it.  I didn't know that.  Psy's Gangnam style got so many views that they had to upgrade the view count integer to 64 bits.
77603	agent_1:i can't really blame the election commission staff.  this is a whole new thing for them and they knew that they were at risk.  if and when something like this happens again they will surely be better prepared.  amazing. agent_2:yes i guess i agree with you, and plus Many voters expressed strong enthusiasm for the election, which they described as a chance to bring fresh faces and new ideas to the political arena agent_1:and compare that with the U.S. where so many take the whole process for granted.  if we want to, we just go to the polls, vote, without any thought of risk or threats.  it really makes me think about all that we take for granted here.	agent_2:Yes, I absolutely agree with you... it is frustrated. So Women voted at separate sites... can you imagine
126372	agent_2:Hmm, interesting! I wonder why they did that? Still not the worst concert ever - apparently Creed was sued for a terrible concert! I wonder what made it so bad? agent_1:I don't know, but I see they were actually sued for it. agent_2:Yeah, by four different people too! Do you think any other band has been sued for a bad gig?	agent_1:I don't know, it's interesting though.  I'm trying to figure out what the article says about Elmo testifying in congress.
66345	agent_1:Yep I agree that's crazy! I think it's weird to that women's soccer has higher television ratings than the World Series LOL I don't know who watches soccer because I don't agent_2:I don't either. lol  Do you watch the NBA? agent_1:I watch it sometimes. I really like Michael Jordan because I always had a pair of his Air Jordans as a kid	agent_2:Nice.  They were banned by the NBA, but Jordan wore them anyways because Nike was willing to pay the fine each game.
160181	agent_2:Yes, their earning power lasts over many more years.  A typical NFL player only plays in the league a few years.  And the average NF game only has about 11 minutes of actual game play. agent_1:Let's see, an NFL season is 16 weeks, with 11 minutes per game meaning there is only three hours action in a season! agent_2:Crazy isn't it!  Well, it's been nice chatting with you.	agent_1:You too.     I'm going to go watch some television.     Maybe some of the 750 episodes of Pokemon.
19760	agent_1:Well,  I think they just have replaced so many members,  they never had 50 members at one time.  agent_2:Right. It just seems it would be tough to make the song sound the same as the original guy who has left the band. Oh by the way, Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago. Can you imagine? agent_1:Yeah i can imagine that,  I think it looks pretty young for its age lol 	agent_2:I wonder if it will survive us humans. We've already destroyed 80% of Earth's forests.
73975	agent_2:Old cars used to have wooden trunks on the back instead of the trunks we think of today. Wonder if they were broken into often. agent_1:Yeah, good point there. DO you know how the drive thru came about? agent_2:I heard it had to do with soldiers.	agent_1:Yeah they were not allowed to get out of their cars in uniforms back in the day
46913	agent_1:Really! And yet he still has time to put on a costume and tickle audiences with performances like Edward Scissorhands, where his memorable role only required him to utter 196 words. agent_2:Wow! I didn't realize it was so few. I'm very surprised that Nicolas Cage was the person who convinced him to pursue acting. It was while they were playing Monopoly. How in the world did those two end up together playing Monopoly? agent_1:I would have like to have seen the two in the same movie together! I was not a big fan of Dep's performance in Willy WOnka, but I am too emotionally connected to the Gene Wilder version of the movie. I guess that is also why Wilder refused to watch the 2005 remake, because he feared disappointment.	agent_2:I agree. Wilder was great in that role and I'm such a fan of his work. I sometimes forget that Depp's breakout role was 21 Jump Street. That was so long ago.
31156	"agent_1:I love FB. I know that Myspace feels stupid lol agent_2:it started out as college kids agent_1:Facebook's ""like"" button is illegal in the german state of schleswig-holstein."	agent_2:WoW. A third of all divorce filings of 2011 in the u.s. contained the word 'facebook'.
156176	agent_2:Yeah I heard about that on my team. This year I drafted Tyreek Hill and he was one of my best players agent_1:Nice. did you know that a single fold in the brain makes the different between fantasy and reality? agent_2:I didn't know that, that's super interesting. There's so much science regarding fantasy and its growing into so many different applications	agent_1:very true. do you know who wrote ' in the realism of the unreal?
142290	agent_1:Holy smokes!  Hope that star never wanders this way.  We'll be obliterated and wouldn't even know what hit us.  A lightning bolt surprisingly is 5 times hotter than the surface of the sun! agent_2:ouch! yikes, for sure! What im curious is why I pay 400 a month in electricity when the sun produces enough energy in one second to meet the needs of the entire planet for 500 000!!!  agent_1:So true!  Did you know that the sun is actually white and only looks yellow due to atmospheric scattering?	agent_2:Wow, I heard that somewhere before its so interesting! I Love the sun, especially since its by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth! Although we are all sources of energy! There is so much we don't know and understand
8022	agent_2:I believe you are correct.  How interested are you by politics? agent_1:I am very interested as the choices I make as a voter will directly decide how I represented, good or bad.  agent_2:Are you sadden by the fact that voter participation hasn't been over 63% in presidential election in the last 100 years?	agent_1:I am as there places in the world where people do not have open and free elections. I vote in every election either in person or by mail in ballot. It's my duty as a citizen and my right.
30415	agent_1:I am not too familiar with him. agent_2:Well, 30 years ago he was offered a 10% stake in nike. Instead he took $100,000. If he had taken the 10% it would be worth $8 billion. agent_1:Wow.  That was a big mistake.  Especially with the popularity of shoes like the air jordans.  	agent_2:No kidding. The players unions should have some kind of money management class for their players.
52688	agent_2:That is crazy.  It's also crazy that one-third of divorce filings contain the word Facebook.  Some people are apparently using it for more than birthday reminders.  Personally, I just like the funny cat videos. agent_1:Haha yep those are good too. Did you know that Mark Zuckerberg is actually colorblind? That's why Facebook is blue, because any other color would be a distraction for him agent_2:I did not know that.  I kind of wondered why they went with blue.  Is it true that Facebook is now worth more than $104 billion?	agent_1:Yes, I think at this point it's worth even more than that, and I wish that they still did the free Whopper Facebook promotion, I would gladly unfriend 10 people to get a free Whopper right now LOL
136181	agent_2:That is funny, some people enter a profession by coincidence. Michael Cain had some really good movies, he is an old school actor and his work is still relevant, it reminds me of the black ans white movies and radio times. Do you still listen to radio? agent_1:Yes I listen to the radio sometimes. I wish I could make my own Foxxhole radio though, all you need is a razor blade and a pencil apparently agent_2:That would be cool, I listen to radio sometimes on my way to work, therefore I just listen to whatever they have on. There is a law in Canada that require radio station to play Canadian music and it has to be at least 40% of what is being played. 	agent_1:glad I don't live in canada! I would like to listen to a jupiter storm on the radio, you can pick it up on the right AM channel apparently
130745	agent_2:I do. What about you? agent_1:Yeah I do a bit.  Do you know who the top 3 wealthiest US presidents have been? agent_2:I heard it was JFK, Jefferson, and Washington. I wonder if Trump will be on that list?	agent_1:Yeah good call, I don't know, but I bet that he thinks that he should be!
64439	"agent_2:Maybe.   The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance agent_1:really ? Have You ever seen ? agent_2:Yes, after I read about Northrop Frye who depicted these two opposing sides as a ""Society of Youth"" and a ""Society of the Old."	agent_1:wow...ok... hey... You're a dog lover ? ;)
25357	agent_1:Yeah I think celebrities have a voice but they should only use it to do good things. Taylor Swift has done a lot of controversial things like removing her music from Spotify. agent_2:I think too many celebrities (like the Kardashians) do not have any ideal what life is like in real America.  And others do their best to distance themselves into the elite.  Social media (right or wrong) gives them an instant and oversized voice.  And they often speak of things they are unknowledgeable about.  They would be better off sticking to what they are good at.  Taylor is an amazing artist, but she is not an average American living paycheck to paycheck! agent_1:Yeah I think they are living in their own little world. Kanye West is another example and he actually did a Saturday night live skit mocking himself for interrupting an award ceremony!	agent_2:I like the way T.S. donated the proceeds of Wildest Dreams song to wildlife conservation and I hope she does more of that.  But wading into politics sullies her image.  What are your thoughts on the income tax?  I like the way Monaco has eliminated the income tax in 1869 because of sufficient revenue from other sources such as gaming.
114598	agent_2:I watch from time to time. You? agent_1:Usually watch big tournaments. agent_2:There's an annual tournament near my house every year. I wear my Lacoste shirt in honor every year.	agent_1:Sounds great. Would love to go to tournament to see Roger Federer play.
125045	agent_2:Supposedly it's a fact that it's bigger.  Maybe one of the wealthiest presidents who were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson helped pay for it. agent_1:Interesting, I wonder how Washington got so rich?  agent_2:I'm not sure.  I think he got a lot of land and money offered to him when he became the general of the army during the revolutionary war.  I could be wrong though.  Up until 1805 the runner up in the US presidential elections automatically became vice president.  That wouldn't fly in this day and age.	agent_1:Interesting, that could be. I heard Trump is actually the richest though, that's what his Wikipedia says.
152800	agent_1:Okay, you can tell I'm hugely into the super bowl! agent_2:Are you a Patriots fan? agent_1:no, i really dont watch football. I did find this interesting though, TOm brady has a man crush on Bill Belichick 	agent_2:I don't agree. I would say at this point of their careers they see each other as equals and teammates for life
57556	agent_2:Its shocking. Which is your favourite entertainment ? agent_1:I love playing PS4. What about you? agent_2:I like playing baseball with my friends.	agent_1:Well it was great talking to you!
64586	agent_2:I think they'd like the law in Collinsville, Illinois against saggy pants a lot more! agent_1:Yeah, you are right! I think I will go to sleep now.Have a good night! agent_2:You too. Read a book before you go to sleep!	agent_1:Yeah, since I am not concerned about moral panic that should help me fall asleep! Night!
144056	agent_1:Oh, that's terrible for them! I bet the owners kick themselves every day for that one lol!  You know what is a little bad about facebook?  Anyone claiming to be at least 13 years old can sign up.  That means, my 10 year old niece can lie and get an account. agent_2:oh yeah, i know and have seen it done!  They are very enethical, which is crazy!  Because in this country today, everyone overreacts to the smalles of things... Yet, facebook is still up. agent_1:That's because a lot of people are  nosey and  feed off of drama-even fake drama.  Otherwise they'd be marching in the streets complaining about how bad it is.  Zuckerberg and friends were really genius in developing it.  I heard they started it at harvard and then branched out to other schools at first. I wonder how they got the other schools on board.	agent_2:EXACTLY!  We have truly become a narcissistic nation and it's sad and nobody really realizes and Facebook does not help!
74554	agent_2:I love the Simpsons they also threated to sue once, agent_1:I saw that and wondered how that would work because I thought Fox owned the Simpsons? agent_2:I thought that as well, they must  have a complicated relationship, the median viewer age is pretty high though	agent_1:I'll have to look into it and yes it is.  I have to get running.  It was nice chatting with you!  Have a good one!
77704	agent_2:I do enjoy watching the world cup matches although I am no expert in FIFA agent_1:I'm the same way. I'm looking forward to seeing the next World Cup when they have it in Qatar. agent_2:Im surprised that nearly 50 percent of the global population watched the fifa world cup in 2010. Soccer sure is popular	agent_1:It's amazing how popular it is, but it is practically the only sport that has a global following. Some players can go to completely different countries and be recognized, like Wayne Rooney.
7533	"agent_2:I see. Same era: Einstein, already a famous physicist, also played violin exceptionally well. agent_1:My daughter has a poster of him above her bed, with the quote ""The Greatest Scientists Are Artists As Well"". She says its inspiration for both her art and music. agent_2:That's great. Have you ever read or seen the film based on the 1902 A.E.W. Mason book, ""The Four Feathers""?"	agent_1:I have not. Is it the one that the judge tried to ban, due to featuring a black character?
66994	agent_1:That is impressive. Carol Burnett was the first celebrity on Sesame Street	agent_2:So that is how that got going. Nice chatting with you today
90073	agent_2:I wonder if they played the fender stratocaster which was intended for country music? agent_1:I would have never guessed that! Have a great day!  agent_2:One last fact about radios there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free.	agent_1:I would love to do that while at work! it would  make it so much better
63776	agent_1:LOL I sure will, but you will have to come up with some side stories, like wreck-it Ralph was really a very neat person who abhorred breaking things and his real name was neat-Nick . agent_2:Lol. Well on that note Im gonna have to go. This was a good conversation. I had a good laugh or two. You have a good one.  agent_1:It sure way good bye. 	agent_2:Bye
60026	agent_1:wow, that is terrifying lol  agent_2:I know, I wonder how it even gets that hot like that, so far from anything as hot agent_1:Yeah,  incredible.  I didnt know the sun produces enough energy in one second to meet the needs of the entire planet for 500,000 years!!!  Everyone should be switching to solar!! 	agent_2:holy cow, that is almost incomprehensible, that is just so much energy
107827	agent_2:Trump and Kanye respect each other as artists, but they work in different genres. Kanye keeps it old school. agent_1:LOL I like that. What do you think about Hillary Clinton by the way? Apparently she was a republican back when she was in college agent_2:She was from money, plus the right wasn't that far right then. I guess the left was more for labor, and she wasn't from a working class background.	agent_1:That makes sense. It's weird, apparently when she was campaigning in southern states, she would adopt a Southern drawl, I guess her husband was the governor of Arkansas for a while so maybe she picked some of that up
159400	agent_1:I know right, few people understant that language lol I hear theres a really popular site with thousands of drama episodes as well agent_2:that would be worth looking into. those old dramas involved a lot of creativity. i probalby know one or two of them. agent_1:Yeah I love dramas, and what are your thoughts on that Canadian law, the one that requires 40% of the music in their stations to be Canadian	agent_2:i guess that the govt wants to protect home grown talent. how will they do that with the internet though.
144265	agent_2:Weird because the album went triple platinum. agent_1:Yeah I don't get it. I also don't get him never having a number one single in the USA or Great Britain! agent_2:Oh well, I would still be happy with 140 million records sold.	agent_1:Yeah me too. He also granted 200 wishes for make-a-wish, good guy overall!
5659	agent_2:I've seen lots of examples on Facebook of people playing a VR game and getting terrified or surprised. It looks like a lot of fun! agent_1:I wonder how much the headsets cost for it?  The fist virtual reality game was made in 1968.  I had no idea they were around then. agent_2:I thought I've heard that VR has been used for training soldiers, so I wonder if it could have been around for even longer than 1968, but kept secret!	agent_1:Quite possible.  I read where 40 percent of users experience motion sickness in virtual reality.
19703	agent_2:Of course, yet I bet the characters always do. It's the violence - and the unexpected shocks - that I don't enjoy.  What's the scariest movie you ever saw? agent_1:I enjoyed the VHS horror movies, they are little know but scary. There was a ghost one on netflix too, 2 of them, and they were great also. How about you? agent_2:Silence of the Lambs. Scared for Jodie Foster's character. Thought Anthony Hopkins played creepiest character I've ever seen!	agent_1:that is awesome and a great movie! I like the stephen king films too, what about you?
13920	agent_2:The teacher was probably persuaded to pass him.  A lot of children aren't even fully potty trained at age three. agent_1:Yea plus Kim Jong has been known to edit pictures to show a different history so I think it's possible he could have photoshopped himself at 3 driving a car agent_2:How true.  I read somewhere North Korea has theme parks and they are undergoing renovations at kim jong-un's orders.  Can you believe they have theme parks, there?	agent_1:Lol I have read about Kim Jong trying to build like the world's greatest water park to open only when the media is around so I can see him building more theme parks
87632	agent_1:hello,  do you like Pianos? agent_2:I like the sound of their music. They have been around since 1700! agent_1:Yeah its a beautiful instrument,  i wish I could play.  That is interesting that there was a piano at the top of the highest mountain in britain lol 	agent_2:I wonder how it got there?
148633	agent_1:I'm glad he did or that would have been disastrous. On a similar note, do you remember Ryan Stiles? agent_2:Was he from Whose Line Is It? agent_1:Yes, that's him. He dropped out of high school to pursue comedy. 	agent_2:That's amazing; I'd be much too afraid to drop out! If I wanted to get into comedy or acting, I'd probably take lessons. Jon Hamm and Patrick Stewart have both been drama acting teachers, so maybe I'd get lucky.
10948	agent_1:wow that is crazy to think. I wish we still had gills, it would make swimming more enjoyable lol agent_2:I agree.   Apparently, loch ness monster is a protected species in Scotland. agent_1:no way! the loch ness is one of 20 quintillion animals on earth, if it is real, are you a believer?	agent_2:I'm not sure.  Apparently Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into two groups.
133222	agent_1:It is. I watched all of them because it is a good show for my little ones. Do you like baking shows in general? agent_2:I do like baking shows, you know Netflix actually employs taggers who are paid to watch content. agent_1:From 9 - noon netflix is 33% of all north american bandwidth...	agent_2:Thats a lot, I guess that a perfect example of how this company has grown, Netflix has 150 movies with a rating of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes.
107977	agent_2:That's what I've heard.  How about Pineapple Express?  I've heard that it's pretty funny, but I've never seen it.   agent_1:I have not seen it either. Do you know ryan stiles? agent_2:Yes!  He was on Whose Line Is It Anyway, wasn't he?  A very funny guy!	agent_1:Yes. he is funny. nice chatting with you
3137	agent_1:Could be.  But if they don't have any they won't know that they find it useful.  Fortunately for sea levels, both of our poles are covered with ice. agent_2:Do you read non-fiction? It's fascinating stuff. agent_1:I have read quite a bit.  I like Grisham and Clancy.  But I also like the best selling non-fiction book, the Bible.	agent_2:Jack London lived as a poor person in London, and wrote a book about it.
91868	agent_1:ha I didn't know that, also that the brand cadillac was named after the founder of detroit, I never knew that agent_2:If you are in South-Africa, you can put flame-throwers on the car agent_1:ha I wish I had a flamethrower on my car, I'm in Michigan and it's cold here	agent_2:Jann Mardenborough became a professional race car driver by beating 90,000 people in the video game gran turismo
119988	agent_2:Yeah, its adorable. The inventor of the dial phone was an undertaker by trade. Amazing. agent_1:that is an odd profession for a phone inventor to be in. I wonder how he got interested in phones. Anyway, great chat! agent_2:Yes, You too! Real quick, the undertaker would convince the telephone operators to reroute his calls to rival business. lol Funny story. HAve a good one.	agent_1:Thanks! you too. have a good day! take care.
73215	agent_1:I agree with you there, so what are your thought on Google? I just learn how the Google Maps app works. agent_2:Oh, I like Google, it helps me find a lot of stuff quickly.  I remember the old days when we just want to KNOW things!  That or spend forever looking them up in the phonebook.  Nowadays a lot of businesses don't even LIST in the phone book.  Can you believe that? agent_1:Actually I can, theres no need with the internet anymore and phonebooks will eventually become obsolete, a siri google search requires a lot of juice	agent_2:Trying to think what was the last thing I Googled... I think it was directions to a local business, but I could be wrong.  Although I do find it worry some that somewhere out there is a list of everything I've ever typed in to Google...  LOL
76118	agent_1:Maybe I'll go to japan or someplace. But I'm kinda sad all their highways are tolls. agent_2:I hear their train are fast, isn't the land of the bullet train?  Japan would be a interesting place, very different from here, different food, entertainment and clothes. agent_1:Yes, their entertainment is also very good, especially the company nintendo.	agent_2:It seemed like all those video games companies were in Japan at one time, not so much now.  Xbox is Microsoft, I guess Playstation is Sony and that's Japan.
90239	agent_2:That is weird.  Did you know that some owls keep blind snakes in their nests?  Apparently the snakes keep away parasites. agent_1:I did not know that.  I never mess with my garter snake and she does not mess with me.  If she helps keep the mice and birds from eating my figs, then that is just fine by me.   Often animals are used as sports mascots.  My alma mater is the LSU Tigers.  Do you know of any sports teams with snake mascots? agent_2:I can't think of any.  Snakes are different though, some lay eggs and some give birth.	agent_1:I was reading somewhere that a professional U.S. soccer team, the Philadelphia Union, selected a snake for their mascot.  To me, that does not make sense...  In soccer you kick the ball and a snake has no feet!
68649	agent_2:I didn't, how funny. I wonder why it's called that! agent_1:I don't know but it make a good ringtone, especially on an iphone that has more computing power than the US Nuclear ICBM deterrent  agent_2:Did you know there is a luxury ringtone maker that hires the London Symphony Orchestra to record its ringtones?	agent_1:I had no clue, I will check that out. Well it was nice talking with you
138290	agent_2:I would think so. She was pretty good in her comedies. What other kinds of comedies do you like. agent_1:I love all types of comedy. Movies, stand up, tv shows. I love movies the best though. I can't name one or two lol there's too many! agent_2:So do you think kung fu hustle is the supreme achievement in modern comedy like Bill murray does?	agent_1:Haha, not really...he is pretty funny though. I heard that The Green Lantern was originally supposed to be a comedy film thankfully it stayed in the drama genre.
93798	agent_1:Yes he thinks that if we eat more diverse foods that is the solution agent_2:Yeah I guess he has a plan there I just do not see how to be honest agent_1:Yeah I know. Do you like soccer?	agent_2:I sure do. Do you know why it is called soccer here?
97072	agent_1:Hulu hosts a lot of the FOX shows right? Damn I would like to watch these shows but I do not want to pay money to watch advertisements. agent_2:Most of the shows on Hulu are commercial free, with the exception of the most popular and then they only play a commercial at the beginning and at the end. agent_1:Oh really? They changed it? When I used it a year ago it was advertisements in the middle of the episode between scenes. No one wants that...	agent_2:In 2000 netflix proposed that blockbuster should use netflix as its online service and blockbuster laughed them out of the office. They have got to be kicking themselves right about now.
142816	agent_2:Yeah it says that she smoked pot and watched tv, and took a nap, how in the hell could you dose off peacefully knowing your children are suffering? Just so sad.  agent_1:Total macabre. I can almost hear the waterphone making creepy metallic noises.  agent_2:Yeah I wonder what that instrument looks like, it makes such creepy sounds!	agent_1:Yeah. I've never seen one. The Shining had great audio effects.
101503	agent_2:Yah I was thinking the same. agent_1:So what do you think of google?  It's a pretty powerful search engine you know. One search requires more computing power than it took to take the astronauts to the moon back in the day. agent_2:It's really big and powerful system in the world	agent_1:It truly is and then again it can be kind of simple. I always wondered how  google maps knows about traffic and I recently learned it is just by seeing how fast android phones are moving on the road.
15431	agent_2:I read articles years ago that they were starting to consider shutting libraries down but now with computer access they are becoming more popular than ever. I use the free wifi to download movies on my phone from Prime. I have completely cut the cable at home, no tv, no dish, no cable, no wifi. I just stream from my phone offline now. In the library of Alexandria they would take original copies of books and copy them putting the originals in the Library for safe keeping. agent_1:I have cut all of my stuff as well. I feel like i should read more to get close to the record of 4700 words per minute.  agent_2:I tried speed reading. It can be done but it takes the fun out of it. And it is not relaxing. It is like driving a race car through a park and finishing it in 30 seconds as opposed to walking for 30 minutes enjoying nature.	agent_1:I wish i could speed read! I think its crazy that people in the 18th century had a panic over the spread of novels.
44927	"agent_2:That's terrifying. What about the jellyfish that are immortal? We'll all be dead, and jellyfish will just be scooting around. agent_1:Lol, someday they might rule the world! Hopefully it's not the zebra fish that kill us off, they have counterparts of 84 percent genes known to be associated with human diseases!  agent_2:That's weird. Did you know that freshwater fish only ""drink"" through osmosis?"	agent_1:I've always wondered how fish drink, but ive never taken the time to google it. Saltwater fish drink through their mouths!
44939	agent_1:Hi. I was curious if you like drama movies? agent_2:Hi!  I do like dramas.  I always loved watching House starring Hugh Laurie.  He earned $700,000 per episode making him the highest paid actor ever for a tv drama. agent_1:Wow I didn't know this. Hugh Laurie was very good at House. He played that role to perfection.	agent_2:I agree!  Did you ever watch Mad Men starring Jon Hamm?
35444	agent_1:Hi, how are you? Are you a baseball fan? agent_2:I used to be years ago when I was young. It's a nice team sport with much skill involved. agent_1:I think it's funny how a married couple scheduled all 2430 MLB games until 2005. I wonder how they got that job.	agent_2:Nice. Even the games played in Japan? Baseball is so popular there, Japanese fans are surprised to learn that baseball is America's game!
15333	agent_2:Maybe he was hoping that the shoes would go to people that needed them. Maybe he has another source of income that's adequate. I don't know.  agent_1:that would explain it for sure. do you watch ballet? agent_2:Not really a fan. It looks painful.	agent_1:yeah it does and they go through 4 pairs of shoes a week
150990	agent_1:ah I have heard that, also interesting is that you could actually have a female player in the NFL, there is no outright rule against it agent_2:Yet, if you are a New Orleans Saints cheerleader you have to leave a restaurant if a New Orleans Saints player enters.  I wonder what would happen if that player was a woman too? agent_1:haha that is a good question! also weird is that the NFL puts chips in players clothes to track their every move on the field, I hope that doesn't get required by governement for civilians one day	"agent_2:I think a lot of that is to really track their ""investments.""  It seems crazy that an average game only has 11 minutes of game play, I wonder how much those chips cost by the minute?"
140271	agent_2:I still remember seeing him bust it out for the first time at a concert, it gave me chills, so smooth! Bill Bailey introduced it agent_1:Gotta go look up Bill Bailey to see what else he did.  I always wondered what kind of formal training Michael had.  Did you know Tupac actually danced ballet?   agent_2:I think he was a tap dancer. I heard he did that in high school or something, he was in the Nutcracker of all things!	agent_1:Man if Tupac were alive, I think I'd want to see him on dancing with the stars.  I'd definitely phone in my vote for him.  Though I always wonder how much the judges vote weigh in the final score.
98384	agent_2:If I read all of it, I likely would never sign it.  Yes, Michael Caine, became an actor because all the prettiest girls at his high school were in drama class.  Good a reason as any, I think. agent_1:lol, He makes me laugh, I saw him in one of his interviews and he said one of his secrets is he doesn't blink! lol, I can remember him in an 80's movie called Blame it on Rio! pretty funny.... agent_2:I don't remember ever seeing that one.  Back to the Internet discussion, did you know that the current Library of Alexandria has a saved copy of the Internet in case the Internet burns down?	agent_1:Good for that! Never know about fires...Guess we won't be seeing Jim Carrey in anymore serious movies! lol
94616	agent_1:I do find the universe interesting. it is quite big and getting bigger. how old is it? who knows. agent_2:Hard to tell the more I read about the universe the more questions that I have, its so big, it has so many things in it agent_1:The universe may be one giant super hologram. how does that sound to you? you might just be a hologram. 	agent_2:That sounds crazy, I think we would tell lol, but who knows maybe that theory is real
122678	agent_1:I really love her idea about what she's making right now. Her clothing is supposed to be athletic but fashionable at the same time.  agent_2:Very cool. She is very idiosyncratic in her creativity. Both body conscious and multi functional. agent_1:She's making such unique clothing that I've heard she's actually got evening gowns made from sports jerseys.	agent_2:Awesome. Definitely figured out how to move street style forward without disconnecting it from its roots.
79320	agent_2:Haha. That would be awesome! ogs perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles. agent_1:Yes thats also I see why they call them mans best friend . So sweet. agent_2:Dogs are so loved. Russia has a tomb of the unknown dog as a memorial for canine research subjects.	agent_1:Yes and  Istanbul has a vending machine that releases food and water for the city's stray dogs in exchange for recycled plastic bottles. I enjoyed talking to you.
112498	agent_2:Ha.  But baby elephants are so cute.  It just kind of becomes a space problem when they get larger.   agent_1:Yeah, and if yo live in a city that requires you to pick up after your animal has a bowel movement, that could be challenging. But dogs are also challanged by the fact that they cannot see as many colors as we can. Doesn't stop my dog from eating all the different colored crayons from the box... agent_2:Lol. Well if your dog can't tell the colors apart, how is he supposed to know what flavor they are unless he eats them.  I guess that is one thing dogs have in common with Mark Zuckerburg has a red-green colorblindness.  That's why facebook is mainly blue.	agent_1:My dog had a MySpace page, but not a FB page. Boy, MySpace really blew it by turning down the opportunity to by FB for a mere $75 mil.
161361	agent_2:Oddly in the nfl there is only one left handed qb, Kellan Moore agent_1:Is that a problem for teams? A lefties a challenge for designing plays? agent_2:I don't know, I figure if it was then a good coach would be able to turn a left handed qb into an advantage	agent_1:I guess so? i don't know how hard it is for defenses to adapt to a new QB. i also wonder how big the advantage of the lefty is.
127927	agent_1:Yeah. It's getting sad. Did you see that 10% of the TSA called in sick over the weekend? agent_2:Its getting ridiculous. Maybe Michael Jordan can send the Senators a pair of shoes to influence them to reopen government agent_1:That would make me work on it a little more...	agent_2:We need someone like Truman back in office to expose corruption and waste again.
92601	agent_2:Haha, I would totally watch more basketball if they did that. Maybe Shaq would have better luck if he tried that. He only has one recorded 3 point score throughout his whole basketball career. agent_1:Poor guy! I like Kareem's dunk a lot too though. agent_2:I like the Harlem Globetrotter's tricks. The Washington Generals have played against them 13000 times but have only won 6 games.	agent_1:Whoa that's a lot of playing time. I wonder how much money they make? NBA players are the best paid athletes by average annual salary.
113723	agent_2:I do want a car. cant afford one at the moment. i had a dodge long ago. the thing ran forever.  agent_1:Well that's good. I wonder how long the Model T lasts? Do you think that they still run? Apparently they were first created back in 1908 agent_2:i bet you can find them. i dont know what they do for parts though. interesting cars that made it possible for the common man to own a car.	agent_1:Ya cars are interesting and so are laws in different countries, for instance and South Africa you can put a flamethrower on your car LOL
138546	agent_1:And he had time to record them while he was in office agent_2:I wonder how he found time to record agent_1:The presidents must be rich to have a guest house is larger than the white house	agent_2:Wow. Did you know that the runner up in a presidential election automatically became the vice president till 1805 ?
70557	agent_1:Hi, how are you? agent_2:Hello, I did not know there was a show called the barbershop. did you? agent_1:I did. Nick Saban and LeBron both had a show called that. I do not think the Shop lawsuit will go far... What about you?	agent_2:Big money involved. I am actually curious to watch it. They probably will reach an agreement. But it looks like the idea originally came from a man called Sebastian Jenkins.
145792	agent_2:Thats amazing, I would like to take a selfie after achieving a goal like that, not many make it to the top agent_1:Very true.  Maybe people in the past have used the method that WWII soldiers did with the pencil and the razor blade. agent_2:That sounds like a great survival skill, do you  listen to the radio much?	agent_1:On occasion, mainly podcasts.  I would like to hear the radio storms that Jupiter has though.
35703	agent_2:I wonder if all those basketball players leave tea bags in their shoes to absorb the odor! agent_1:It would be hard running the floor with those in there... Just kidding! Kareen got the dunk banned for a few years! agent_2:I wonder why 5000 year old shoes perform better and if that would still hold true while playing sports?	agent_1:Not sure. Maybe better cobblers back then. Steve smith leaves his cleats on the field to raise awareness of homelessness.
25780	agent_1:ya that would be inspiring, not inspiring is that only half a percent of people actually vote in the reddit polls agent_2:That's not a lot. Almost as much as a local election! agent_1:hahah that is true, can you believe that reddit has half a billion monthly vistors and in a year about 1.2 billion comments?	agent_2:Wow! Nice chatting with you!
146667	agent_2:Yeah! Peyton's considered by many to be one of the greatest passers ever! agent_1:Plus, Eli is not only a great quarterback, but I hear he's got an IQ considered to be genius. agent_2:Must be interesting at family gatherings huh?  Wonder if they have a sister?  Did you know the NFL has no written rule against female players?  Would've been interesting to see a female Manning in the NFL	agent_1:That would be great! Their family is so great that a Mississippi campus has speed limits representing Archie and Eli's numbers.
111447	agent_2:Because old cars used to have wooden trunks on the back. Learn something new every day. agent_1:Hilarious, is that a joke, or is it real?  agent_2:It's real! I would never lie to a stranger on the internet. What kind of scoundral do you think I am	agent_1:Hilarious. Well, did you know the sun is actually white? Sort of surprising to me.
53295	agent_2:I do, any favorite sports? agent_1:I like basketball. sometimes football and baseball. You? agent_2:I like those and also like swimming and soccer	agent_1:that is good. those are good sports. i never liked swimming much.
11775	agent_1:Yeah, but being rich takes a load of stress off of your shoulders. For example, Judge Judy makes $123,000 per episode! agent_2:Yeah thats why I would just want to be rich,  i dont care about being a celebrity at all.  agent_1:Well, I guess normal people have it easy. We can just play video games all day!	agent_2:Tom Hanks' brother does the Woody voice in the video games and merchandise.
10977	agent_2:Hi and yes i love dogs!  I like how they are related to wolves.  I wonder what their original ancestor was like.  Do you like dogs? agent_1:I love dogs, they have 12 types of blood agent_2:I had no idea about that.  i guess that means it's hard for them to get blood transfers when they need one.  	agent_1:yeah but good things is that there are dog blood drives
158611	agent_2:That would be Elvis, not to be confused with President Banana, first Pres of Zimbabwe. agent_1:Yeah I wonder if that means something else in their language though agent_2:Oh, I am sure it is a moniker of utmost respect and admiration... The functions of the President can vary between government structures. Perhaps in Zimbabwe, the President has power limited to oversight of long, yellow fruit.	agent_1:Yeah cannot rule that out. Do you know who the wealthiest us presidents are?
98066	agent_2:Apparently Siri was developed from a DARPA US defense research program. I wonder how it was used for defense? agent_1:I really do not know either. Did you know SIri was supposed to be for blackberry and android phone originally? agent_2:No, I didn't! I wonder if that's why Siri uses Bing as its search engine. Though, to be fair, I don't know which company makes Bing either, so...	agent_1:I think it is Microsoft. Yeah Siri was bought by Apple in 2010 hence she is with Apple now
65433	agent_2:I love comedies!  How about you? agent_1:I do too! Do you have a favorite comedy? agent_2:I used to love the Drew Carey show because I'm from North east ohio.	agent_1:HA! I loved that show. I still gigle when I see it. I loved his cross dressing brother... I just found out he was in fargo too! I had not seen it before this week.
56230	agent_1:the guy is worth it. he will be in the hall of fame for sure. highest paid celebrity! agent_2:Did you see who was second? agent_1:Judge judy. she could certainly shoot a basketball LOL	agent_2:Is it ganny style if you are a granny? Wouldn't that just be called style?
148070	agent_1:Must just be a very laid back guy, unlike every politician in the lime light today. agent_2:Lol good call. I agree. can't imagine the first president of Zimbabwe aka banana would take that well. agent_1:Or the president of Indonesia...with 3 pop albums! Who undertakes so much responsibility at once? Thats just crazy!	agent_2:Yeah agreed. Maybe he is trying to get paid like JFK, Washington, and Jefferson!
13716	"agent_1:Why does the character have a number name eleven? agent_2:She was a part of the experiments of mind control and moving to other dimensions to hear what the Russians are plotting about - and all previous ""experiment"" subjects failed. She is number 11 and is successful ;) agent_1:Oh, like R2-D2 maybe robotic?  Who is your favorite actor in the show?  Is it Winona Ryder?"	agent_2:R2D2 was doing telekinesis ? ;) I don't remember that ;) I hate Winona Ryder in that show... kids are acting better than she is. I like the kid that's in Verizon commercials now ;)
24646	agent_1:Just one teabag? for my stinky shoes, it might take a dozen LOL agent_2:Ha ha well that would even work better! In addition the shoes I also like close. There's a store in Alabama that only sells clothes, cameras, and other things found in unclaimed baggage at airports. agent_1:I wonder if there is any good stuff there, or if it is just stinky shoes and the like.	agent_2:If that is the case make sure you bring lots of teabags! Apple even had a clothing line in 1986.
23160	agent_1:Some steps are very difficulty he performs very well. Amazing performer. agent_2:Did you know that Tupac Shakur danced ballet in High school? agent_1:Yes. some birds fly from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping when migrating.	agent_2:That's cool to know. Most birds have bones that are so hollow their entire skeleton weighs less than the feathers.  Did you know that?
12099	agent_1:It sort of sounds not real to me.  agent_2:Yeah I kind of have a hard time believing it as well. I like watching some of the crazy movies they have made about sharks like The Meg or Sharknado as well. agent_1:Did you know sharks can be trained like dogs to bark? 	agent_2:I did not know that. That's another shark fact that I have some skepticism about!
7366	agent_1:Ditto! I am reading Steve Jobs' biography and man he was a genius but didn't seem very nice.  agent_2:lol, I have heard that before. I heard alot of those guys don't want their kids on the phones and ipads.  agent_1:I dont either and I am pretty sure I am addicted to the dopamine hit I get everytime I open my phone.	agent_2:True, Do you listen to Pandora?  I see they have a cap on how much you can listen for free.
2114	agent_1:Yeah and there are even picture of the iceberg that sunk the titanic agent_2:Leonardo DiCaprio is one of my favorite actor, do you have a favorite actor? agent_1:I do not think I have a favorite one but he was soo good in the titanic	agent_2:If you had to bucket list, what will be number on your bucket list?
76713	agent_2:Agreed. She used to be Paris Hilton's assistant. I would love to see that! agent_1:Yeah, that makes sense. they are perfect for each other. I don't think either of them has talent, but that they are famous for being famous. agent_2:Totally. You know the band Fall Out Boy? She was in one of their music videos.	agent_1:I dont know the band. she has the look of a gal for a music video. i wonder what she is like in person. vapid, frivolous?
28122	"agent_2:I haven't heard it.  I like a couple of their songs.  It's wild that Queen's guitarist Brian May has a PhD in astrophysics. Smart rocker! agent_1:One of the Pink Floyd guys has a houseboat that he turned into a recording studio. That sounds like it would be a fun visit. agent_2:I wonder what album they recorded on that boat.  I liked ""Wish You Were Here.""  "	"agent_1:I don't know. My favorite is 'Learning to Fly'. I hope he doesn't invite Eddie Van Halen over, he set the studio speakers on fire, recording ""beat it""."
