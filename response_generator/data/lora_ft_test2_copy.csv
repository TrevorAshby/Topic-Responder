We just watched Empire of the Sun, it had a very young Christian Bale in it!	agent_2:I like the jurassic park movies a lot. Me and my son like watching stff like that he loves dinosars.	agent_1 likes movie. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'entertainment', 'movies'].
10602	agent_1:Hi there, did you hear that Amazon pulled out of its decision to build its second headquarters in NY today? agent_2:I didn't hear that.  They have so many locations, and such a wide reach.  Jeff Bezos certainly has vision agent_1:Yes, it's crazy that they started out as an online bookstore and now it's so big it's the largest internet retailer in the world agent_2:They even own imdb! agent_1:I guess it makes sense that once they had that property, they'd move into streaming video and producing their own content with Amazon Studios agent_2:They certianly have capitalized off their success, even getting USPS to deliver packages on sunday agent_1:Yes, and their own workers move a lot of packages, too. A warehouse workers walks between 7 and 15 miles over the course of a daily shift. agent_2:That seems like a lot, I wonder how soon before they start replacing them with AI? agent_1:It's only a matter of developing the technology to a point where the automation is cheaper. There is actually a non-profit organization for the advancement on AI, I wonder what kind of people contribute to that! agent_2:Facebook is even in on the development of AI, trying to understand human emotion, and predict user actions.  It is almost there with the fact when you search for something you start to see ads for it on Facebook.  Re-targeting as become amazing that way agent_1:Yes, we're at the point where tasks like OCR are often excluded from AI because they've become such a routine technology. agent_2:I personally am excited to see further development in the self driving car type of technology. agent_1:I love driving, so I'm not personally excited to use that, but I think it's better than dealing with all of the distracted drivers on the road because they're looking at their phones. Google actually calculates traffic using the movement of Android devices on the road! agent_2:I didn't know that.  Thats pretty cool, I was wondering how they got that info, I knew it couldn't be just people logged on to maps. agent_1:Yes, I guess you have to watch what you agree to! I bet the some agreements are even drafted by AI	agent_2:Probably, those things I never read and now I owe them not only my soul, but all the winnings if I were to ever hit the lotto.  lol.

1271	"agent_1:There was man who was falsely imprisoned. He used the prison library to study law and learn to free himself. That is amazing don't you think? agent_2:That is awesome! Speaking of libraries, there are more libraries than McDonalds in the United States. Do you have a library card? agent_1:I do and that is good to hear. Also, half of adult have library cards that seems like more than I would have thought. agent_2:I know. I don't know that a lot of my friends go to the library. The Sacramento Library has instituted a type of library that might make going to the library more interesting to many. They started a library of things, so you can check out sewing machines and other things that you don't need to own for a long time. agent_1:That would be so useful. I wonder if other cities do that? I know that normal library collections often included DVD's and CD's and other things besides books. agent_2:Yes, and I have also checked out passes to various museums in my city. I'm glad some people were dedicated to starting libraries in the past as they have been so useful to me. Have you heard of UK Prime Minister William Gladstone? agent_1:I have. I heard that he started a library in 1895 with 32,000 books in it. All from his personal collection. Can you imagine? agent_2:The more amazing thing to me is how he carted all those books by wheelbarrow over 3/4 mile. He was 85! agent_1:Maybe his daughter helped him. I wonder how many were Shakespeare plays. I was reading one at the library. Did you know that Shakespear coined many of the terms we use today, including ""good riddance"" and ""laughing stock?"" agent_2:Oh, that's interesting. I would never have thought as luck would have it, break the ice, and full circle were from Shakespeare. agent_1:I guess it makes sense that he coined so many terms since he was the world's greatest dramatist. Plus, he wrote so much. He wrote 39 plays!"	agent_2:Not only did he coin terms, but he created names. The names Miranda, Olivia and Jessica were invented by Shakespeare. I didn't know those names went so far back!	agent_1 likes history. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['history', 'shakespeare', 'terms'].

When your assistant can't talk to your music to play on your speakers, there's a problem! agent_1:i have a huge problem getting alexa to connect too sometimes tho. it always tries to open ""spotty control""... my husband and I always joke that we are an ""amazon family"" i didn't realize how true that was until I learned that amazon has owned IMDB since 98!"	agent_2:Since '98?

3749	"agent_1:Good Morning! Have you ever heard of K-Pop? agent_2:K-pop is the music which is originated in South Korea, they are more popular in 2000. agent_1:I like how South Korea blasted K-Pop across the border to North Korea in 2010. agent_2:The north korea sank a south korean warship in 2010, south korea responded by blasting the k-pop song ""hit your heart"" across the border using large military loud speakers. agent_1:I bet that was very annoying to listen to all day and night! Did you know even Jackie Chan manages a K-Pop boy band? agent_2:Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, to make the movement repeat and well organised. agent_1:Speaking of choreography, ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of shows a week! agent_2:Ballet dance is originated in Italian Renaissance in the 15th century and it become concert dance in France and Russia. agent_1:I think it is cool that it's still around to this day. Michael Jackson has some patents on some of his dance moves, crazy! agent_2:Dance is also represent the culture and traditional of particular region. Mostly it make our body well control and organised. agent_1:Even Tupac dance ballet in high school and performed in the production of the nutcracker. agent_2:Babies are dances immediately when they hear music and make their body very flexible. agent_1:I think it's crazy how babies can do that. I can't believe Bruce Lee was a dancer and was even in a dance championship in 1958! agent_2:It is very interesting. Dance is art, sometime other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have dance like quality, including martial arts and physical activity. agent_1:That is an awesome type of art! I think birds are a type of art as well, especially hummingbirds that steal spider webs for their own nests. agent_2:Birds are living world wide and there are more than ten thousand spices world wide. Birds have wings which developed more or less according to their species. agent_1:That is a lot of species! In most birds, their skeleton weighs less than their feathers! agent_2:So only it make to fly very high and far away. Some times birds travel from one continent to another continent for their breed."	agent_1:They even go without sleeping during the migration!	agent_2 likes nature. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['nature', 'hobby', 'dance'].
1152	agent_1:Are you aware that the taller candidate for president has won 75% of the elections of them time.  agent_2:Hello - it doesn't surprise me. I've even heard that taller people in interviews for jobs tend to get the job more often. agent_1:Crazy, is that true?  agent_2:Not sure how true it is, but that's what I've been told. Did you know Hillary Clinton was president of young republicans in college? agent_1:I'm not surprised. Did you know Arnold traveled 3 hours a day to Sacramento when he was the governor?  agent_2:Wow that's crazy. I can't imagine traveling that far for work.  agent_1:Me either. Did you know Tim Leary ran for governor of CA?  agent_2:I did not know that, but that's interesting. I didn't know congress has played a democrat vs. republican baseball game every year since 1909.  agent_1:I did, it must be one boring game!  agent_2:Yea I bet it is a very boring game. A cat named Hank placed third in a Virginia senate election once before.  agent_1:I can believe it. Did you know Nevada is the only stat that has a none of these candidates as a voting option?  agent_2:Wow I didn't know that about Nevada.  agent_1:Yeah, must be an interesting state to live in. Have you ever visited there?  agent_2:I have been to Las Vegas twice. What about you? agent_1:Yeah, I've been. But I don't think a majority of the people that visit there vote.  agent_2:Yea, I'm not too sure on that. I saw that all elections conducted in Oregon are conducted by mail. agent_1:Interesting. It rains a lot in Oregon, have you ever visited? 	agent_2:Never been to Oregon, but not a state I think I would want to live in with all of the rain they get. 	agent_1 dislikes travel. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['travel', 'Italy', 'politics'].
9283	agent_1:Good morning. Do you follow politics? agent_2:Good morning, I'd say I follow some politics, but not too deeply. agent_1:Were you aware that the taller candidate usually wins in the election. since 1900 it has happened 75 percent of the time. agent_2:Is that so, maybe I should enter politics, I'm over six feet, I could have missed my calling. agent_1:Maybe so. Lol. Did you know that nevada is the only state to have a none of these candidates option while voting?  agent_2:I guess it's nice to have that option, especially if you have one one your really don't want to vote for, for example, someone who doesn't exactly agree with history textbooks. agent_1:On a funnier note. President truman in 1957 refused to have his picture taken with dumbo because he didnt want to be associated with republicans. Lol. agent_2:Media savvy in the days before camera phone and the internet, I would categorize him as forward thinking. agent_1:H sure was. Did you know that the use of red and blue for the two major parties was not used until the year 2000. Crazy huh? agent_2:That is the kind of thing you think has been around for ever.  Maybe that is why we only have two major parties, everyone's two favorites colors are taken. agent_1:I think they should just change all of their colors to brown. During the 2012 elections international electoral observrs were blocked from the polls in nine states. agent_2:That would make me suspicious of what is going on there, why don't they want to be observed?  These are the places that end up with animals becoming mayor, or cats placing high on Senate elections. agent_1:I would say a cat would be better than some of the politicians. So have you ever played fantasy congress? agent_2:Fantasy congress sound like it is taking the whole fantasy sports thing to far.  I can't see many people sitting in bars yelling at CSPAN because their politician has made the wrong move.	agent_1:No janet you were supposed to be against abortion. Lol. I v could see it as well.

10783	agent_1:Did you know about the wild birds in Australia and their pecularity? agent_2:Can't say that I have. What about them? agent_1:Well they mimic the sound of car alams, chainsaws and also cameras,  agent_2:Oh, that sounds like the lyre birds. I guess I have heard of them. Birds are neat. The reason they can fly is thanks to their almost hollow skeleton. agent_1:That must be really funny to listen at lol, you know that birds have bones that are so hollow they can even weigh more than their feathers agent_2:I believe it, especially when some of them are only two inches long. Can you imagine being so lightweight? agent_1:It would be graet to fly, thats something I can imagine, I bet the dodo bird was a magestic animal agent_2:That depends. Do you consider pigeons majestic? Dodos are actually part of the pigeon family. agent_1:No, not really, but Dodo seem to be a lot different than pigeons, do you know that some birds travel really long distances without sleeping!!	agent_2:Like when they migrate?	agent_1 dislikes migration. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['migration', 'nature', 'wild birds'].
4698	"agent_1:hi, did you vote in the last election? agent_2:Hi, how are you? Which election? 2018? agent_1:The 2016 one? agent_2:Yes, I did vote. Did you vote? agent_1:Yes of course. Did you know the indian government put a poll in a forested area full of lions for a single voter? agent_2:I guess the gov't needs to make sure everyone has a chance to vote. The US is different. The voter turnout for presidential elections hasn't exceeded 62.8% in the last 100 years agent_1:I cannot believe more people do not get out and vote, teally agent_2:They probably feel that their options are poor. Except in Nevada.Nevada is the only state to have the ""none of these candidates"" voting option for presidential elections agent_1:I like to have that option really. Did you know astronauts vote from space? agent_2:I figure they have the right.

1475	agent_1:Hello there, so have you seen any of the Star Wars movies? agent_2:I have seen several. I read Tran who played rose left Instagram after racist messages from fans. agent_1:That is so sad fans are so cruel to people.  I have yet to see her in that movie, I really want to though.  agent_2:Me too. The last Jedi divided it's fans agent_1:Yeah I think each movie does because there are so many of them and they all have their different tastes.  But the personal comments to the actors is just stupid.  agent_2:Did you know Chloe Bennet changed her last name to get in to US easier agent_1:No I didn't know that, I wonder how many people do that when they come here.   agent_2:Seems like a lot. Apparently they get more call backs with American last names.	agent_1:Yeah I can see that, and whatever helps for them I'm sure they will do.

13279	agent_1:I built a toy robot once. Have you? agent_2:No, I'd probably electrocute myself if I tried, but it would be cool to have a pet robot agent_1:The company Anki is introducing a small table top companion.  Kind of like Alexa.  The think I built was programmed in basic.  This you talk to. agent_2:Yea, ANki wants a robot in every home, hopefully there is no ulterior motives agent_1:I am sure this thing will collect data while it rolls around the table top.  Kid does not like peas.  Must inform the high command.  The fur child has thrown up again.  Scary the information it will collect. agent_2:Sounds creepy to be honest, a palm sized robot that can crack jokes agent_1:Should a robot have expressive eyes?  I do not want to think of this little thing as feeling.  Remember Rosie from the Jetsons.  Thats what I want.  Smart, dangerous, useful. agent_2:Yea, Vector sounds creepy to me, nudging people's hands for attention agent_1:Honda's Asimo was pretty strange to watch.  It must have been costly. It was pointless as far as I know. agent_2:Yea, I wouldn't pay 1,000 for an Asimo agent_1:I think it cost far more than that.  Anki has a kickstarter to raise funds.  Looks like they will make the $500,000 goal.  Soon the robots will take over the world. agent_2:Maybe that is why Michael Jackson planned to build a 50 foot robot to protect mankind from other mini robots agent_1:Vector will cost $250.  You can buy a lot of them.  Release them into the desert.  Watch the 50 ft tall ones hunt them down.  Make a reality TV show out of it.	agent_2:Hopefully Vector is never created using rat brains, then that would be a serious problem	agent_1 likes TV show. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV show', 'pets', 'robot'].
1549	agent_1:Government is fascinating. It seems so different the world over yet there are common threads in every type.  agent_2:I agree. Some governments try to help, others, not so much. agent_1:So true. I wonder what america would look like if we had a PM instead of a president. A PM seems to be held more accountable for their actions.  agent_2:True. Much easier to remove. Australia's PM position isn't in the constitution and exists only through custom. That seems strange to me. Not in the Constitution? agent_1:Australia's constitution is weird though. It doesn't protect the people as much like an american one does.  agent_2:I did not know that. Number 10 Downing Street has a cat with a title! I wonder how many other government headquarters have animals like that. agent_1:With all the historic buildings in the UK I could see why they need one. Older structures like that tend to attract rodents.  agent_2:Is one cat enough though? Might need a support staff. agent_1:Right? lol. I wonder if you can meet the cat if you tour the offices? agent_2:The cat doesn't take visitors without an appointment. agent_1:I could see the cat being involved in a lot of the pranks the UK officials seem to play on each other.  agent_2:When you turn 100 in japan, the PM gives you a silver cup to celebrate. Too many people are turning 100 so that they had to find a way to make cheaper cups. Maybe give the cup when people turn 200? agent_1:That would be one way to cut the costs. How many people are turning 100 that it is costing enough to have to find a cheaper solution? Talk about a healthy society.  agent_2:Yeah. Celebrating a centennial is cool, but the gov't can't afford it! Are you a fan of Johnny Depp?	agent_1:I find him very interesting. He is one of those chameleon actors that you never watch and go Oh that's Johnny Depp he sort of absorbs the character. 	agent_2 likes movie. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'pets', 'pets'].
5361	agent_1:Do you follow basebal? The Nationals traded Daneil Murphy and Matt Adams agent_2:Yes I do. I didn't know that. Who's your favorite team? agent_1:I'm a Yankees fan, I never knew Babe Ruth was caught stealing home in the 1926 World Serires agent_2:It's surprising, you don't hear many bad things about Babe Ruth. I like the Dodgers therefore I am anti-yankee. agent_1:They had a great rivalry when both were in NY. It's crazy Babe Ruth would ever try to steal a base considering how big he was agent_2:I wonder how many stolen bases he had in his career. Maybe he thought he could just run the catcher over. agent_1:That would be an interesting fact to know. It's pretty crazy the Ottoman Empire was still around when the Cubs won back to back World Series	agent_2:Yes the Cubs have suffered from the curse of the goat.	agent_1 likes sports. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'baseball', 'Babe Ruth'].
5895	agent_1:Hi, how are you? agent_2:Good, how are you? Celebrities in science are quite rare aren't they? I was a fan of Stephen Hawking. I'm sad he finally passed away from ALS. agent_1:He was tremendous thinker. Gosh, I wonder if he was as smart as Kim Jong-un, who has a degree in physics, supposedly.  agent_2:I would think that he is smarter. I wonder how it felt to have such a physical disability but yet such a sharp mind. agent_1:In his younger years, he wasn't badly afflicted. I wonder whether he was one of the  scientists who theorize that universes evolve through natural selection agent_2:Hmm, it wouldn't surprise me. Hawking went further than Einstein did on understanding of gravity. Hawking developed new graphical methods that let him visualize physics of light paths in warped space, black holes, and the convulsions of the universe. agent_1:And he did all that while battling ALS. There is a theory that there is only one electron in the universe. Does this make any sense? I wonder who came up with that. agent_2:Hmm, it does not to me but I know I'm not much of a scientific mind. Hawking strengthened the Big Bang theory as well that says that the galaxies were in a compressed area smaller than a single atom before the big bang. agent_1:Hard to imagine, but I guess the mathematics supports it. The universe could have come from nothing without violating physics. Particles can pop in and out of existence, so I guess a universe worth could as well. agent_2:Yeah, it's hard for me to relate to scientists and all of their elaborate theories but Hawking was blessed with wit. He was quite the jokester, which makes him very relatable. agent_1:I think he took to his celebrity status quite well. Pixar studio has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities. I wonder if Hawking ever got a chance to see it. agent_2:Speaking of celebrities, did you know that Judge Judy is the highest paid celebrity after lebron james? agent_1:The woman is a legend. Over $100k per episode. Probably a longer career too. But she probably hasn't done any animated voice work. agent_2:I guess celebrities doing voice work is a fairly new thing in terms of history. Robin Williams was the first to start the trend of celebrities doing animated film voices. This was for the movie Aladdin. agent_1:Did he ever appear on Sesame Street? Carol Burnett was the first celebrity to appear on the children's series. He would have been great on that show!	agent_2:That is a good question!

409	agent_1:Do you like wearing hats? It has so many functions! agent_2:I don't like them on myself but I know a lot of people that can pull them off.  agent_1:Yes me as well. In the military hats denote a nationality, branch of service, rank or regiment. agent_2:I noticed the different hats in the military but did not know it had to do with rank.  agent_1:Yes they have a function to play. In the old west, the most popular hat was the bowler! agent_2:Wow! They always show a stetson or something close so I'm shocked by that.  agent_1:Yes me as well! Tipping of ones hat arises from the knights raising their face visors. Very chivalry of them! agent_2:That's a very interesting fact. Did you know that until 1998 British politicians were required to wear a top hat if they were making a point of order? agent_1:Oh wow that seems kind of an old tradition. Kind of like that conical party hat which was derived from dunce caps! agent_2:That's also a strange hat. As far as old traditions in British politics I don't understand why they still wear powdered wigs in court either. So strange.  agent_1:Agreed. They look so silly in my opinion. A lot of rapping attire looks silly too. But the rapper Tupac was very talented as his music is in the library of congress of cultural significance. agent_2:I'm surprised they would include any rap at this point to be honest. Speaking of rap, do you know what Eminem wanted to be before he was a rapper? agent_1:I didn't know that. Very interesting. Rappers also have some odd beliefs. Like Kanye West who thinks AIDS is a man-made disease. agent_2:Eminem actually wanted to be a comic book artist. Kanye West is very strange and has a lot of strange ideas.  agent_1:Yes he is. But he has done some good things like giving a mic to a fan in a wheelchair at his concert. agent_2:That was nice of him. Did you know that Busta Rhymes did voice work in an animated movie?	agent_1:Oh yeah you're right.

3401	agent_1:How's it going? Do you like sports? agent_2:Pretty good.  You?  I do like sports.  I'm glad baseball season is about to start back up! agent_1:Did you know there is a golf course in Dubai that requires 4 million gallons of water a day? Seems like such a needless waste. agent_2:No I didn't but I totally agree with you.  I guess Dubai is in a desert region so they need a lot of water to keep the grass green but it still seems wrong just to play golf on it. agent_1:Even the ones in the US only use 312k gallons a day, which is no small amount, but is much less than that one single course. agent_2:Isn't Dubai mostly for the wealthy?  That could explain the excess. agent_1:It actually is not even as wealthy as New York or London. It is only marketed to seem very wealthy when in reality it isn't all that much. Abu Dhabi is actually the most wealthy city in the world. agent_2:I didn't know that! I always thought it was Dubai. It looks like I've believed the hype.  Speaking of hype, did you know that Babe Ruth was one our most famous golfers? agent_1:He must have been much better than Micheal Jordan haha. Did you know Samuel L Jackson puts a golf clause in his contracts that allows him to play golf twice a week during production of a movie? He must really love golf. agent_2:He really must and people must love him to allow it in his contracts!   agent_1:Did you know kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada? That's kind of weird. agent_2:It does sound weird.   Did you know that the ymca invented softball? agent_1:They also invented volleyball,softball and basketball. I find it hard to believe the basketball one though, pretty sure it was around before the YMCA, I could be wrong though. agent_2:I don't know. I heard somewhere that James Naismith invented basketball.  I'm not sure if he was with the ymca or not.   agent_1:A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in his grandfathers attic, talk about a stroke of luck! agent_2:That is lucky!  You know, I've heard that baseball is super popular in Japan.  Over there they are surprised to learn it's our national pastime. agent_1:Man as of 2014 the average salary for a pro softball player was between 5,000 and 6,000, does not sound like a good sport to become a pro in. agent_2:No it really doesn't.  It's odd that's it's so low considering softball was the first sport shown on espn.	agent_1:Well i would say soccer is probably the best sport to go pro in because they make more money than basketball,football,and golf combined.	agent_2 likes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'hobby', 'hobby'].
7545	agent_1:Hello there, do you follow baseball or MLB much? agent_2:I do, although I haven't followed it much the past couple of years. agent_1:I am the opposite, I have been following more closely these last few, especially this last season as my team almost made the world series.  agent_2:Oh, which team is that? Is it the Cubs? They were the first team to win back to back World Series. agent_1:No, I am a fan of the Brewers, I have never seen them play in a series, one game away.   agent_2:What was the longest at bat you've ever seen? There is some question as to what the longest at bat ever was. agent_1:I don't know probably only 20 pitches or so, but I figure the longest is pretty darn long.  Did you know managers can technically play if needed? agent_2:I didn't know that, but it makes sense. Also, apparently the longest at bat ever was 21 pitches.  agent_1:That is all, that doesn't seem like very many considering a full count is minimal 5 pitches.   agent_2:Well, apparently there is some dispute. The 'story' doesn't match any game on record, but the story has been told for over 70 years. agent_1:Yeah and I guess the records began being kept in 1988, so who knows what it was before that.  agent_2:Yeah, I guess 1998 is considered the modern era. Before that teams didn't watch stats too closely. agent_1:That is crazy, that doesn't see that long ago.  I'm sure there are all kinds of crazy records before then. 	agent_2:Cy Young apparently won 435 games, now 200 is considered incredible. 	agent_1 likes sports. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'team', 'Cubs'].
13254	agent_1:Toymaker Anki is really skilled, he has mastered the art of toy making agent_2:I agree.  He makes a lot of robotics right? agent_1:Yeah, cat, dogs robots, he launched a robotics company back in the year 2013, so exciting agent_2:That is exciting.  From what i hear Anki wants his robots to be able to hold their own with people. agent_1:I think it would be a great service for people, I heard they  are the best selling toy company on Amazon agent_2:They've got a new product called Vector.  It is like Alexa and their goal is to have one in every home. agent_1:Oh so they are working with Amazon now?

Did you know that it evolved from a game in England? agent_1:I do like the game, yeah, and no I didnt know that, I wonder why its not popular in England then agent_2:I don't know.  Baseball is a form of an old bat and ball game played there back in the mid-18th century.  It's weird that it's popular in the US and especially Japan and not there. agent_1:It is odd, maybe as odd as the managers wearing uniforms in the field,  agent_2:I've always wondered why they do that.  I assume it's to show team membership but I don't really know. agent_1:Its because they can also play if they think its the best thing, if the need arises they can step into th field, did you hear about that man that found 3 million dollars worth of cards in his attic agent_2:So a manager can play?  I didn't know that.  If we are talking about the same man he found old baseball cards, right? agent_1:Yeah he found card that belonged to his grand father, they were just hidden in the attic, crazy luck right! agent_2:Definitely!  Those cards had been hidden away since the 1940s!  I guess the people living there either never went in the attic or never looked around. agent_1:So you said you liked baseball so maybe like the Yankees? what are your thought on the team agent_2:I like the Yankees.  There's some odd stuff with them though.  I mean, did you hear about the two pitchers that swapped families permanently back in 1973? agent_1:I didnt, why would they do that lol, that is really odd I have to Google that agent_2:It is really odd but I guess it was the 70s  so who knows.  I've even heard there is a""lost"" yankees player.  That is especially odd to me. agent_1:What does that even mean, a ''lost'' Yankees player? can you elaborate more about it agent_2:I really can't, sorry. I just heard that one thing, a lost player.  No one ever expanded on it to me.   agent_1:Oh I see, well nothing Google cant solve then,  you know  a player got suspended because he refused to take a haircut agent_2:No I didn't!  What player? agent_1:His name was Don Mattingly, crazy right, that happened back in the year 1991 agent_2:You know, I would have thought it would have been much longer ago than that.  I guess I just figured there were stricter rules on hair back in the day."	agent_1:I guess so, still sounds a bit stupid to suspend a player just because of that, I think he was a key player for the team so yeah. 	agent_2 likes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'hobby', 'video games'].

I'm curious. agent_2:I honestly never heard about it, but read couple minutes ago. I'm wondering is it only Japan, but any Asian country as well.  agent_1:Interesting, do you know if they play a championship game there? And if so, what is it called?>  agent_2:I have no idea. But if so, why US teams don't play aganst Japanese? lol It could the World Cup like in soccer/footaball every January 4 teams from different continents play  agent_1:I don't know, curious why we call it a world series but the two countries never play each other.  agent_2:Absolutely. Have you read an article about Chicago Cubs recently? agent_1:No, I didn't see it. Apparently when they won the 2016 series 5 million people celebrated.  agent_2:It also was the first baseball team to win back-to-back world series. I actually didn't know it.	agent_1:Awesome.

How about you? agent_1:I love to travel as well, so relaxing I want to visit Mackina island, sounds like a really peaceful place agent_2:Where is that? I don't think I've ever heard of it. agent_1:That is actually located in the US, I cant recall where but motorized vehicles have been banned there for more than a century agent_2:Wow! Are they trying to keep a historical feel to the area? agent_1:Seems that way, the air must be clean and free of many of the pollutants we have in the city, Japan also seems like a great destination, kind of expensive though agent_2:Japan would be an amazing cultural experience, but travel inside the country is pricey, maybe even more than travel to the country! agent_1:Yeah highway tolls cost more than $300 dollars thats too much money  agent_2:I guess if you traveled there, it would be best to focus on one city so you don't have to spend on traveling around. It's probably expensive to travel in Iceland too. Most people there without cars take flights to get from city to city! agent_1:That makes sense, seems like it would be just as expensive and the flight time is less, the firs king of Hawai sure traveled a lot agent_2:I wonder if he was surprised at the size of the world after ruling a small chain of islands for part of his life. I know I would be. agent_1:Sounds like something to be excited about I bet he saw many kinds of birds in his travels agent_2:He probably saw some kinds that he had seen at home, since birds migrate so far.

The modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson. agent_1:Pelosi is the new Speaker of the House. She was not very welcomed in Florida a couple of months back when she was in Florida campaigning for the democrat candidate. agent_2:Why not? Anything in particular? agent_1:She is just not well liked because of her brash personality I presume. agent_2:I see. Did you know There hasn't been a us president who wasn't a republican or a democrat since 1853? agent_1:No, but I would have ventured a similar guess. To add to your point, the colors of blue and red have been used to differentiate the parties since 2000 agent_2:I thought it was longer than that! Every us president with a beard has been a republican. agent_1:Yeah, that was a weird fact. Another similar one would be the fact that Truman refused to be photographed on a ride at Disneyland. agent_2:I heard it was because it was the dumbo ride and so he wouldn't be associated with republicans agent_1:Silly.  We need another tough progressive like Teddy Roosevelt. agent_2:The last time a republican was elected president without a nixon or bush on the ticket was 1928! agent_1:That is quite some time. There are very few conservative democrats left in office. agent_2:The GOP presently hold ""trifectas"" (the executive branch and both chambers of the legislative branch) in a majority of states (26/50), and a ""trifecta plus"" (executive, legislative, and judicial branches) at the federal level, as five of the nine current Supreme Court justices were appointed by Republican presidents. agent_1:I think that might be higher with the confirmation of Kavanaugh recently.  agent_2:Likely! Here's a funny fact; Fox news threatened to sue the simpsons in order to stop them from parodying its famously anti-democratic party agenda. agent_1:Sounds just like fox.  Do you know the republicans actually started out opposing slavery. agent_2:I didn't realize that, no.  agent_1:A small percentage of Tea partiers identify themselves as democrats agent_2:I think I heard 15%."	agent_1:You are correct.	agent_2 likes TV show. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV show', 'music', 'theme park'].

What is the antifa? agent_1:I am not exactly sure what Antifa is either. agent_2:Just looked it up and it is a left wing autonomous militant group agent_1:Ah I see seems natural they would oppose them. agent_2:Agreed. Mind if we switch to a lighter subject for the sake of this chat? agent_1:Sure did you know that shirts encompass many different types of attire for the upper body? agent_2:I did not.  That makes a lot sense. I use mine to hide my shame. agent_1:Haha me as well shame is well hidden in shirts. agent_2:I would have fit in well during the chinese cultural revolution.

Did you know Elmo testified before congress? agent_1:No, was it a joke or for real?  agent_2:Im not totally sure, but I know he is the only non-human to do so.  Maybe Oscar the grouch was causing some problems down in the hood or something.  lol agent_1:LOL, I wonder what actor played him?  agent_2:I dont know, I always just imagine a stuffed toy or something.  The Congress always plays a Rep vs Dem game of baseball each year. agent_1:Yeah, that is fairly common. It must be a very boring game to watch though.  agent_2:I agree.

But this is interesting too..even though he did almost none of the work, when spartacus got the academy award for best cinematography, it went to the credited cinematographer, and not kubrick. agent_2:Probably, some kind of union thing, like he was not an official cinematographer.  I wonder if they gave him something for it.  agent_1:Thats a good question! No woman has ever been nominated for the academy award for best cinematography. agent_2:I guess it is because there is not many female cinematographer because they would not hire them. Sexism still exist.  agent_1:That is terrible. A woman has never even been nominated. agent_2:Yeah, do you see movies made by a woman ? agent_1:I haven't paid attention to that. I'll have to now.

There are people out there going to bed without food.  agent_1:I really dislike that whole Kardashian family. I think  it is ridiculous how much money they make and they dont really seem to earn it.

Did you know that birds have regional accents according to scientists? agent_1:No, I didn't know that.

What would be the three meals you would have? agent_2:I did order a bagel, meal balls and I love cheesecake, what about you? agent_1:Probably some protein like steak and a bunch of carbs.

I just watch the avenger infinity war on there. im a big marvel fan.  agent_1:I haven't seen a lot of the Marvel movies,was it good? agent_2:Awesome!! you know hasting got the idea after he had to pay a large late fee.  agent_1:I heard it was a $40 fee or so.

1937	agent_1:Are you a fan of jazz by any chance? agent_2:I like jazz but cant say I really know much about it. agent_1:It's an interesting genre. Jazz trumpeters grew goatees because it provided comfort when playing.  agent_2:that is interesting. Tupac Shakur studied jazz when he was in baltimore school of the arts agent_1:I would not have expected that at all. Things may have gone differently for him had he followed that passion. I know that the New Orleans style of jazz started in the 1910's.  agent_2:thats over a 100 years ago. Jazz has been seen as a major form of musical expression since the 1920's  agent_1:That is an old form of music especially compared to the most popular forms of music now. Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts. agent_2:I never new that . Did you know that louis armstrong ended the beatles three months on the billboard top 100 agent_1:WOW! I didn't think anything could stop The Beatles. No offence to Armstrong but I know a lot more people that still listen to The Beatles.  agent_2:This is a pretty interesting guitar fact,  A dial tone is in the key of f, serving as a pre-internet trick to tune your guitar agent_1:WOW!

Queen's guitarist, Brian may, has a PHD in astrophysics. agent_2:he also built a guitar out of parts from an old fire place and his mothers knitting needles . super smart agent_1:Yes.

I am also a big fan.  agent_2:I agree. did you know that the nokia ringtone  from a 1902 composition by spanish classical guitarist and composer francisco tarrega, called gran vals. agent_1:I did not.

I wonder where the iPhone ring tone came from because I hear that everywhere lol.  agent_2:have you ever heard about a mute man from england that could only communicate to others with a piano	agent_1:I had not heard that but it's actually quite touching that he could find a way.

13555	agent_1:Hello.   What do you think of Pluto-planet or not? agent_2:If it were up to me it would be a planet. Seems silly to deem it otherwise. agent_1:I agree.  I don't like how the parameters for what is a planet and what isn't is determined by where and what they orbit. agent_2:Yeah but humans are a weird species, they have laws and rules for everything agent_1:True.  Look at Jupiter's moon Ganymede.  If it orbited the sun it would be a planet by definition. agent_2:Yeah and there is also a planet that orbits 4 stars, that's crazy. agent_1:I wonder how that works. I guess the stars are close together?   agent_2:Maybe, but they would have to be far enough apart so they are not affected by each others gravity fields yet be able to influence the planet that is orbiting them. agent_1:That's true.  So that would mean a very large galaxy.  What do you think of the planet where shards of glass precipitate sidewys at 4500 mph in 2000 degree fahrenheit weather? agent_2:Man that would be scary, imagine is it started raining glass on earth, we would be screwed. agent_1:Yes we would.  For something odd closer to home we've got Venus with it's no seasons. agent_2:Do you play video games? I play probably way more than I should haha. agent_1:I do play some. I play more on my phone nowadays though.  It's said that we play three billion hours of video games a week. agent_2:I mainly play on pc and I play a ton of a game called League of Legends, I have over 4k hours, pretty crazy how addicting games can be. agent_1:That's for sure.  I have to say though that I don't agree with some people that games are an art form. agent_2:it really depends on the game, for it to be art it really needs to stand out, but really games are not more art than a movie is. agent_1:Did you know that video games were initially used by the military? agent_2:Yeah I can see that, they are good training for certain things, like hand eye coordination. Video games also make more money annually than all Hollywood films.	agent_1:Even still, South Korea has a law that it's illegal for kids under 16 to play video games past midnight.	agent_2 dislikes video games. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['video games', 'astronomy', 'planets'].

Do you like dogs? agent_1:I love dogs, they have 12 types of blood agent_2:I had no idea about that.  i guess that means it's hard for them to get blood transfers when they need one.   agent_1:yeah but good things is that there are dog blood drives agent_2:Are there really?  I have never seen or heard about one before. I would definitely take my dog to give blood if I could. agent_1:Yeah not sure which countries have them though. do you know how tou can help dogs in Istanbul? agent_2:I  think I have heard about that country having vending machines for food and water for stray dogs. All that is required for payment is plastic bottles. agent_1:yeah I really like that approach, that is super nice for the dogs and the environment agent_2:I like it too.  America and actually, all other countries, should adopt that approach.  Dogs are very smart. They are the only animal other than an elephant that understands pointing. agent_1:that is true, you are right. google even prefers dogs agent_2:I am glad to hear that for some reason!  I like knowing that one of my favorite sites to use likes dogs. I am surprised though that they have taken a stand regarding it. agent_1:yeah it is in their code of conduct even agent_2:Pretty impressive!  I will tell you something equally as impressive.  I know for a fact that dogs watch television.  They are not colorblind and they understand a great many of our words. agent_1:yeah they just see less colors than we do agent_2:They have had such a long history of association with humans thought that they understand human behavior. agent_1:yeah exactly, they are known as our best friends after all agent_2:Yes they are.  It's weird to me that they can thrive on a starch rich diet.  It seems like they would prefer to have meat.	agent_1:yeah, it is their diet from the wild so that makes sense	agent_2 likes food. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['food', 'pets', 'vending machines'].

Did you know Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory is the best-selling album of the 21st century? agent_2:That's actually pretty surprising! Two twins in Japan released a rap album when they turned 100. It's never too late I guess. agent_1:Well said! I would love to hear it sometime haha. The Dark Side of the Moon was still one of the top albums in 2014, 40 years after release!"	agent_2:That's pretty awesome!

I was never much of a Ramones fan but they toured almost non stop for 20 years playing a total of 2,263 concerts.  That's a crazy high number of shows. agent_1:Definitely! I've never heard of them though. Did you know that Creed was sued in 2002 because their concert was so bad?	agent_2:I didn't know that!

Have you? agent_1:No I saw the original one but I didn't see the newest one, my friend side and said it was really bad so I wanted to see your opinion agent_2:Ok, I do like SOME horror, but I usually pick and choose. I liked The Shining, The Omen, The Exorcist. Rosemary's Baby. What about you? agent_1:Yeah those are all good movies. I also liked Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street. The new Halloween note took in about $89 in only 3 days, so it was definitely popular agent_2:I haven't seen those. I think that remakes are risky.

I didn't know not all men in the uk could vote until 1918! agent_2:haha mine too. Do you that all votes in Canada are equal to all the votes in California minus 50 votes. agent_1:I believe it! I wonder what Canadian politics is like. I wonder if they used the same gavel as long as the US senate did? agent_2:I'm not sure.do yo know that JFK voted against the 1957 civil rights act. agent_1:And he was a democrat wasn't he? Crazy! He didn't have a beard so he had to be, since every president with a beard were Republicans! agent_2:not necessarily, at some point Hilary Clinton was the president of young republication in college. I wonder what made her change her political party.  agent_1:Very interesting! Harry Truman was so anti republican that even at disneyland, he refused to be pictured on Dumbo! agent_2:interesting. He was selected to be the vice president under Roosevelt because he was able to expose corruption and he saved the government $10-$15  billion when he ran the senate Truman committee. agent_1:That's one way to get into the office! I didn't know we only associated colors with the parties as late as 2000! agent_2:Really? I didn't know either. but yeah some did a really great job like Strom Thurmond. he holds the record for the longest filibuster by a lone senator because stayed on the senate floor speaking for more than 24 hours non stop. agent_1:I remember hearing about that!

India even set up a polling station in the jungle for a single voter. agent_2:haha that's kind of funny and I feel bad for that voter. agent_1:He or she had a fun time finding it I'm sure.

All that money invested and what return yet agent_1:I heard the Nationals might trade Bryce Harper, maybe Houston should have tried to get him instead agent_2:They might need him agent_1:He's good but not as good as Aaron Judge though"	agent_2:Hopefully Aaron Judge will not be out for more than 3 weeks	agent_1 likes sports. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'sports', 'no'].

They actually get financed by ireland since the film would encourage tourism agent_2:I wonder if that strategy works for the country, I guess it does since many people around the world watch the show agent_1:I'm sure it does. Which arcs did you enjoy the most of got agent_2:I liked the second story arc, that one was amazing what about you? agent_1:I like the 3rd arc since it makes everything else pale and insignificant in comparison.

I like how the director and Harrison Ford debated if his character was real or not! agent_1:Now that is something that I have thought a lot about as well. That classic line at the end of the first movie delivered by the replicant was actually improvise by the actor. agent_2:I think the whole concept of that movie was done right just by hearing about it!

It must have been towards then end of Creed.  agent_1:I would assume so. I also recently learned that Pink Floyd held a concert in 1972 with no audience. I wonder why they did that? agent_2:Oh wow, that's kind of odd. I heard that in 2010 Lou Reed and his wife held a high frequency concert for dogs. I'm sure they enjoyed it.  agent_1:Lou Reed is a weird guy so I'm not that surprised. There is an ancient Roman amphitheater in Croatia that is used as a concert venue. I bet that would be amazing.  agent_2:That would be an amazing experience seeing a band playing there."	agent_1:It would leave you with a story to tell for sure. I would take so many pictures. 	agent_2 likes hobby. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobby', 'TV show', 'music'].

11976	agent_1:Hi there! I'm not sure about you, but I have recently learned so much about politics! agent_2:Me too, a lot of cool facts like how the red and blue colors of republicans and democrats started in 2000 agent_1:That is crazy considering how tightly aligned they are now! There has not been a US President since 1953 that was not a Democrat or a Republican. agent_2:Really since 1953? the other parties should really step up their game agent_1:Oh darn it, no I meant 1853, so it's been even longer!  agent_2:Oh that's surprising, maybe one day a president from one of the other parties will win. The last election was a joke I didn't like either of the candidates  agent_1:I guess every US president until recent that has had a beard is Republican. agent_2:Seems like you know a lot about the Republican party any cool facts about the democrats? agent_1:I'm not sure. I feel like I know more about Republicans. What about you? agent_2:Not many, but 15% of the tea party movement identifies with the democratic party as well	agent_1:I would never have guessed that at all. I like to look up information a lot on YouTube. It is so handy.

10597	agent_1:Hi there, did you hear that Amazon pulled out of its decision to build its second headquarters in NY today? agent_2:I didn't hear that.  They have so many locations, and such a wide reach.  Jeff Bezos certainly has vision agent_1:Yes, it's crazy that they started out as an online bookstore and now it's so big it's the largest internet retailer in the world agent_2:They even own imdb! agent_1:I guess it makes sense that once they had that property, they'd move into streaming video and producing their own content with Amazon Studios agent_2:They certianly have capitalized off their success, even getting USPS to deliver packages on sunday agent_1:Yes, and their own workers move a lot of packages, too. A warehouse workers walks between 7 and 15 miles over the course of a daily shift. agent_2:That seems like a lot, I wonder how soon before they start replacing them with AI? agent_1:It's only a matter of developing the technology to a point where the automation is cheaper. There is actually a non-profit organization for the advancement on AI, I wonder what kind of people contribute to that! agent_2:Facebook is even in on the development of AI, trying to understand human emotion, and predict user actions.  It is almost there with the fact when you search for something you start to see ads for it on Facebook.  Re-targeting as become amazing that way	agent_1:Yes, we're at the point where tasks like OCR are often excluded from AI because they've become such a routine technology.	agent_2 likes technology. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['technology', 'news', 'retail'].

Did you ever watch Big Hero 6? agent_2:I have, it was an excellent movie. What about you? agent_1:I liked it a lot, I never knew it was Disney too much while watching it, apparently it was rendered with a 55,000 core supercomputer agent_2:Talk about high tech! Bill Nye was a scientist consultant for Disney's flubber! agent_1:no way! That is awesome, I never knew that. lol. Bill Nye is the man! agent_2:Pixar also named wall-e after walter elais disney. agent_1:that is a nice shout out to walter disney. I like the other shout outs too, there is a subculture dedicated to finding hidden mickey mouse images in disney things agent_2:Speaking of mickey mouse, Minnie mouse was short for Minerva mouse. agent_1:no way, all these short names, I never knew that!

13153	agent_1:hello! how are you doing? What did you think of the article? agent_2:Not exactly one I've ever thought about for sure. agent_1:I figured we could just start by looking at the first section here. I found it really interesting about using robots to prepare Mars for human arrival. agent_2:I'd feel a lot better in a way sending robots up first to test things. But, what robots do not have are human emotions that would have to deal with such a bizarre plan. agent_1:Sorry for the delay. I was reading ahead and got distracted. I totally agree with you on that. The idea that we may only be 20 to 25 years away is crazy to me. agent_2:I just really don't see the point from what I've read here. Why travel so far to go to somewhere that has nothing to offer a human? Can't you just move to a different destination right here on Earth? Seems an awful lot to go through just to get away...no? agent_1:No it totally makes sense. I think the appeal is going somwhere we have never gone before. Still, it seems easier to make the earth more inhabitable than to move to another planet entirely. There are many areas of earth that we could spread to if we invested this level of effort. agent_2:Yep.....the Sahara desert comes to mind. As far as it making sense, I suppose, to those explorers out there who'd like that sort of thing. agent_1:Yes for sure. It is just such an interesting concept. To me it is just crazy the amount of time money and planning that goes into this kind of project. agent_2:Well, being alone and 61 years old, I'm willing to give it a shot, I would just be overly concerned about boredom! What to do with all that time on a different planet? agent_1:Right exactly. I have no idea how I would occupy myself. agent_2:That is why I'm sure the scientists would have to put those willing through plenty of tests to see how they would handle such a change. Like I said before, sending robots first is an excellent idea. But, they can't measure a person's mind dealing with it with robots. Can they? agent_1:No and I think that is the biggest issue we don't know on this type of journey. The physical toll would be intense yes, but the mental toll may be unimaginable until someone is put through it.	agent_2:I would think that travelling with many other people that are alike would be of some comfort. You know, many people not knowing what their future will bring will certainly give it's way to plenty of conversation topics. But, for that long? 	agent_1 dislikes travel. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['travel', 'technology', 'news'].

Would you believe it if I told you that the Chicago Cubs last won a World Series when the Ottoman Empire was still in existence? agent_1:am... no, I don't think I would believe that... ;) was that in Wikipedia ? ;) lol agent_2:Maybe a saved version of wikipedia.  I won't soon forget when the Cubs really did win, back in 2016, over my Indians. agent_1:Your ? ;)  at that time You were cheering for Indians ? agent_2:Yes.  I'm not the owner of the team ;) ... they're just from my hometown. agent_1:Although I'm Polish - I got that ;) lol. How are they doing these days ? agent_2:Pretty good, on top of their division last year, but no where as good as the Red Sox.  They had an amazing start to the year, and then they won the World Series. agent_1:Holy crap, nice. Probably fat bonuses for everybody... but hey... if they made their fans happy, why the heck not... they earned it ! agent_2:They did.  It was almost too easy.  They have great pitchers, good hitters, and a new manager.  Normally, a new manager isn't a help, but he was from the team who won the World Series the year before, The Houston Astros. agent_1:Huh... do You think he knows a secret for winning World Series ? ;)  idk... I think it's just a well paid team ;) agent_2:Money and chemistry build winning teams, if you ask me.  Baseball is popular in the US, Japan, and a few other places.  Is it played much in Poland? agent_1:Not really, but we do buy baseball bats :) to go watch soccer games on a stadium :) agent_2:You buy bats?  Why?  I used to collect baseball cards, which can be quite valuable!	agent_1:well... when one soccer team meets other soccer team and those two towns/teams are not friendly... You need to take whatever You can smuggle to the stadium to fight off the hooligans from the other team ;) lol - baseball bats are selling good in Poland but nobody plays the game ;) lol	agent_2 dislikes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'personal life', 'sports'].

A pajama party and a live satirical operetta with talented musician clowns. that is something else agent_1:The use of a pillow pit might be a little bit disturbing for some! agent_2:It might. And it is nice they start with sweet dreams from Eurythmics agent_1:live players doing popular music like Dream On as part of the show is surprising! agent_2:They play with music and even with toys. They did release beach balls in pirates of penzance, fun agent_1:They also swap genders in the production of Pinafore. agent_2:the price is not expensive, $30 to $74 agent_1:Not unexpected, given that the theater only holds 100 or so people. agent_2:How much do you like jazz agent_1:I dig it.    Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States agent_2:It  is fascinating, comes from ragtime and blues and it is called the Classical music of America agent_1:Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, and is more modern.	agent_2:It did spread around the world and gave origin to different styles around the world	agent_1 likes music. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'opera', 'sleep'].

I am kind of frightened that there is a breed of jelly fish that are immortal. Yikes! agent_1:And lobster!  They are immortal in a sense that their organs dont age,  so as long as nothing kills them they can technically live forever.  agent_2:Yuck. I don't like that at all. One of the most interesting fish is the balck swallower fish that can eat prey twice its own length and ten times its weight. Sounds like one of those creepy snakes that eat huge animals. agent_1:Yuck?  Ah you dont like seadfood?  I love eating lobster lol I think that fish black swallow is amazing,  to have the ability to have their body stretch like that,  who knows when their next meal will come along.  agent_2:I am allergic to shellfish...maybe that is it. But can you believe this...  I named my son Fisher. So there is a little love there! agent_1:oh thats too bad, sorry to hear.  Haha Fisher,  thats a great name.  Freshwater fish drink water through their skin! agent_2:Interesting! I just learned that there are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth. Crazy! agent_1:Yeah and they are not even all discovered yet!  theres a bunch undiscovered animals and insects in the amazon rainforest still.  agent_2:The rainforest frightens me. Too many creatures! I can only imagine how many insects are in there!  Did you know that animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated? agent_1:I didnt.  I guess I would never notice because my dog is white lol agent_2:That is funny. My dog has a white patch ...but not on it's forehead!  They say that hiccups are a holdover from early evolution when early land animals had gills and lungs. agent_1:I kinda wish we still had gills lol That would be sweet to swim longer under water. 	agent_2:I agree!

I want to go to Iceland but it sounds like the public transport isn't great-will probably rent a car. agent_2:No crepes, I did have snails which I like. I've had a layover in Iceland, it looks like the moon. Flying it a lot of volcanic lava flows turned to rock. Did you know about that gnome stealing thing, take a picture, then return? That a lot of work. agent_1:Haha yeah I heard about that. Does sound like a lot of work. Did you fly any domestic flights in Iceland?

Do you like fiction, a reader? That how I bide my time. agent_1:Awesome lucky. Yeah fiction is entertaining. I like it because it is not based strictly on history or fact. agent_2:Yes, I'm not much on Science Fiction, more literary fiction. I didn't know Isaac Asimov coined ""robotics"" I have friends who  love him and Sci Fi. What genre do you like?"	agent_1:Oh nice good genre. I like fiction as well.

7694	"agent_1:Do you truly believe aliens exist? agent_2:Yes I do.  I don't think we are all alone in this universe.  What do you think? agent_1:To be honest it has to be possible think about all the species of animals especially the ones we don't even know about in the ocean. Dolphins are already smarter then us so how could aliens not exist agent_2:I so believe we'll eventually find some.  But, I feel kind of like Stephen Hawking, it's dangerous to be communicating with them. agent_1:But what if people like stephan hawking understood things we dont' he is on another level of intelligence kind of like elon musk they are the human versions of aliens with their brains agent_2:I agree with you about that.  If we found some aliens, I'd say let's watch them for a good long time before any attempts at communication and they probably feel the same way about communicating with us. agent_1:Exactly if aliens wanted to harm us they could have easily already have done it, they don't want to interfere with us we shouldn't interfere with them agent_2:I agree, there's something to it, though when the UN has a contigency plan in place should aliens ever attempt to contact the Earth.  So, somebody knows something, they just can't alert the masses and create panic around the world. agent_1:So true and don't you find it wierd how drones were first military technology and then a couple of years later it becomes available to the public. Where did the military steal their ideas from drone technology from? agent_2:The same place they stole a whole bunch of their other ""ideas"".  It's just a matter of time, but hopefully Trump will have his Space force up and running by then. Lol agent_1:We're getting into alex jones and joe rogan territory here lol you should watch that on youtube so you can have a good laugh agent_2:I'll have to check it out, for sure.  On a side note, I hear that the Hudson Bay region of Canada has less gravity than the rest of Earth. Wonder why? agent_1:Might have something to do with magnetic fields we need to get neil degrasse tyson on the case he'll figure it out agent_2:Lol, I'm just wondering, will I be lighter on my feet there?  And will the weight of the world not feel like its on my shoulders?  Asking for a friend. agent_1:LOL these are the real questions the people want to know agent_2:Exactly!  I read that Jupiter saves the Earth from getting hit by so many asteroids.  That's very nice of it. agent_1:Poor jupiter its basically a giant shield for our great ball of water agent_2:True and poor old Pluto lost its designation as a planet!  Wow! agent_1:Pluto will always be a planet in my heart lol they can't just suddenly change something like that"	agent_2:That's how I feel too, about little ole Pluto.

Did you know that they are not color blind, but they can't see as many different colors as humans? agent_1:I didn't know that, but that's cool. Did you know google prefers dogs to cats? agent_2:I've heard that their code of conduct specifically states that. That's pretty cool! agent_1:Speaking of cats, when a cat reaches 15, they've spent 10 of it sleeping. Must be nice! agent_2:That's funny. Did you know there's a town in Alaska has had a cat as its mayor since 1997.  agent_1:They have my vote! Cats are famous sometimes, even one from the Godfather part 1 that was a stray on set! agent_2:Did you know there's cat cafe's in Japan and Taiwan where people can pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks. I wonder if that would go over well here. agent_1:I think it would with dogs, since they perform many roles for humans! agent_2:I didn't know that they have 12 different blood types.  agent_1:Me neither! They also have dog blood drives for them to donate to! agent_2:I need to take my dog to one. I give blood all the time so he should too.  agent_1:I'm sure he would save many dog's lives!

It is so surprising to me that it took that long for two women senators to protest by wearing pants on the senate floor. agent_2:They wore pantsuits, they kept it classy. haha. agent_1:Yes they did.  Senate is very big on tradition.  They used the same gavel for 165 years until it got cracked. agent_2:Senate can be so cool, haha. Did you hear that in 1988 they arrested senators to force them to vote? I thought that sort of things only happened on House of Cards agent_1:I have heard about that.  One of the senators tried to escape and was carried feet first into the senate chamber by three officers!	agent_2:Yeah, I think that rule might be from before senators were elected.

Here on planet earth. A 4.5 million year old rock. I wonder if aliens seen our movies?  agent_1:yes you are right, I really like all the Jurassic Parks, I have watched those movies several times. agent_2:Dude!!! Tell me about it.

The Cubs were the only team to win back to back championships  agent_2:Yes and they have not won since then so I wonder what happened there agent_1:Yeah one wonders right? Women's world cup on the other hand has higher ratings than the world series.  agent_2:That is pretty impressive. The largest gathering in human history was when the Cubs won the world series in 2016 agent_1:Yeah I heard more than 5 million people were put celebrating agent_2:Yeah that is insane.

The moon is the only natural satellite of the Earth! agent_2:It would be interesting to see what the sky would look like if we had more than one moon! agent_1:That would be kind of weird after seeing just the moon my whole life.  About 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered in water. agent_2:I think that the deep ocean is just as interesting as space, there is so much we haven't discovered there as well! agent_1:I agree there.  That's the next frontier.  Unfortunaley, more than 80% of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed. agent_2:It's sad to think about that. I do like that a lot of governments around the world are trying to fight deforestation. agent_1:Yes.  I've been to some unforested areas where I live and I was blown away by the size of some of the trees.  Another sad note is that Earth will be virtually helium free by the end of the 21st century. agent_2:I wonder what industries that would effect besides inflating balloons? agent_1:I'n not sure. lol  Do you know much about Mars? agent_2:I know it was named after the Roman God of War and I followed the Rover we recently had up there. agent_1:I actually just looked yesterday at the last panorama view they put together.  If you fly to Mars under constant 1g accelaration it will only take 2 or 3 days. agent_2:That's not too bad, I hope we get someone on there soon/ agent_1:I think that would be so neat.  A Mars colonization project planned for 2023 will be funded by creating a reality tv show.  Maybe we'll get the chance!  It's been fun chatting!	agent_2:It was fun talking to you as well, it's a bit sad that the plan to colonize Mars is being funded by reality TV and not our government.	agent_1 likes news. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['news', 'environment', 'forestry'].
3367	agent_1:Hey, you a fan of any sports involving hitting balls with sticks? agent_2:Many such games fit that description.   Golf is one I enjoy. agent_1:I like golf a lot. It's a real shame how much water is wasted per day on each course, though. It's over 300,000 gallons a day a course! agent_2:True, but consider that golf courses in America combined are larger than the size of two small US states! agent_1:Yeah, golf must be pretty popular in that case. Did you know there exists a golf course in Dubai that uses around 4 million gallons a day? That must cost a lot of money.	agent_2:I suppose that comes with games that cannot and do not utilize a standardized playing area	agent_1 dislikes board games. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['board games', 'hobby', 'favorite sport'].
9709	agent_1:Hi. I think it's so fascinating to learn facts about the earth. Earth will be virtually helium free by the end of the 21st-century. I wonder what is causing that? agent_2:Good question! Humans only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds if the entire earths history was viewed as 1 day! agent_1:Wow that is hard to believe. And back when the earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long. agent_2:That is wild! Over 80% of Earths natural forests have been destroyed! agent_1:That is quite sad. Only 20% remaining, well I hope we can conserve that at least. agent_2:Hopefully! Do you think extraterrestrials will ever make contact with us? agent_1:I don't know that is a good question I think at some point but I don't know if it will be in my lifetime. There is definitely a lot of sightings in the literature but no specific evidence. The FDA once burned 6 tons of literature in an active US censorship. agent_2:That is absurd! I love how there is a literature contest that challenges people to come up with the worst opening sentence to a novel. agent_1:That is very funny I would love to read some of those sentences. One surprising thing is that romantic kissing is a fairly recent development and is rarely mentioned even an ancient Greek literature. agent_2:Very interesting. Love how Churchill won a nobel peace prize in literature and not peace. agent_1:Yeah that is very interesting and something I did not know. He was a very smart man. Pretty cool he was  able to accomplish that back in 1953. agent_2:Have you seen the Wonder Woman movie? agent_1:Yes I have it I thought it was really cool. Gal Gadot did a great job. DC comics must've been very impressed. agent_2:Definitely! She actually served in the Israeli Defense Forces for 2 years. agent_1:Wow she is really an amazing woman. Explains why the fight scenes were so realistic. When wonder woman first appeared as a member of the Justice society in 1941 the group made her their secretary. Oh how times have changed. agent_2:I did not know it was the highest grossing superhero origin movie! agent_1:Yeah that is a huge accomplishment wow. It is also the highest grossing world war one movie. agent_2:Very impressive. I really did like that movie. agent_1:Yes it was a great one. 2017 was also a great year for movies and it was the first year since 1958 that the top three highest grossing domestic films were female lead.	agent_2:Makes sense!

The best guitarists are the ones that set stuff on fire from playing... or have a phd in astrophysics like the one from Queen. agent_2:Yes. He is a smart guy. agent_1:Do you know how to play the guitar?  agent_2:No. I wish that I did	agent_1:Same here.

5087	agent_1:Hi, how are you doing this evening? agent_2:Hi I'm doing well. Do you like baseball? I personally think it's really boring haha agent_1:Baseball is a slow game. I usually pay attention around the time of the playoffs. Then there's a lot of energy. agent_2:Yeah it gets burst of energy, and then a lot of really boring Parts LOL. I never knew that baseball managers could actually play for their team. That's why they wear uniforms, duh agent_1:Yeah, it's easier to just watch the highlight reel. The managers probably played way back in the day. Now? It would be sad. I'd want my money back. agent_2:Haha yep they would probably get injured really quickly LOL have you ever played kickball when you were a kid agent_1:I played kickball. Safer than dodgeball, that's for sure. agent_2:Yep I agree with you there. In Canada they call kickball soccer-baseball instead, it doesn't quite have the same ring LOL agent_1:It sure doesn't. That's clunky name. Baseball is so popular in Japan that many fans are surprised to discover it's  america's national pastime. I wonder why? The sport started here. agent_2:I agree with you. It's very screwy that they would not realize that LOL oh, did you hear about the man who found millions of dollars of baseball cards and his grandfather's attic? Now that is living the dream haha agent_1:That would be great! I would sell some of them, but keep some for a long-term investment. You never know how much they could be worth one day. agent_2:No you're right. That's why I don't throw anything away. And it's also why my house is a mess LOL. One thing I don't understand is why the MLB used a married couple for 24 years to schedule all their games, why wouldn't they use a computer agent_1:The couple probably used some kind of technology, but I bet they had a friend at the MLB head office. Maybe they were inexpensive? I dunno. agent_2:haha ya, and they did that until 2005, very crazy! agent_1:That's a long time. Do you watch the World Series? I try to. agent_2:No I can't say that I do haha. I like I said I don't really watch sports that much. I know that it is the best-of-seven games correct? Who do you want to win this year agent_1:I like it when an underdog wins. I'm tired of big city teams with big payrolls winning. The Series should bring out the best in the fans and the players.  agent_2:Yep I like that too. What's crazy is that Babe Ruth tried to steal a base in game seven. That's what made him lose the 1926 World Series. Wasn't Babe Ruth really fat?	agent_1:He was pretty big later on, but he was also a pitcher at one time, so maybe he was speedy. Still, stealing a base? He was a hitter, not a runner.	agent_2 likes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'hobby', 'selling'].
12475	agent_1:Did You know that humans may have lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago ? agent_2:I think that fact is misleading. After all, we still have plenty of body hair today. I think it would be more accurate to say humans lost their fur (a consistent/extensive hair covering) within the last 240,000 years ago. agent_1:wow ;) we had fur ? ;) agent_2:What do you think animal hair is? That's why I find wearing actual animal fur so disgusting. I wouldn't wear the skin and hair of another human. Why would I want to wear the skin of an animal? agent_1:no, what I meant was - did WE - humans had fur in the past ? agent_2:Well, yes. Technically we still have fur today (although it is spotty). Fur is the covering of hair used to protect an animal and help it control its temperature and reactions to the climate. agent_1:ok... I've never thought about it this way... agent_2:I think once you adjust your mindset and realize how close we are to modern-day animals, you begin to change how you think of the animals themselves. agent_1:We are modern days animals ? how so... we just sit all day and look at the monitor :) agent_2:We're not just modern-day animals. We ARE animals. Homo sapiens are part of Hominina, which is a subtribe of Animalia (how we classify animals). agent_1:Well at least from a name , ok, but we are logical, spiritual and very intelligent... I don't know if one can call us animals :) agent_2:I disagree. I think animals are also very logical and intelligent. If you think about it, they are smarter than us. Humans are responsible for destroying the planet - and not only are we aware of that, we are consciously choosing to continue! agent_1:...but the fact that we are self-aware should make us something more than animals... agent_2:Animals are very much self-aware. They can plan for the future and cater their reactions to their environments. That is why you see so much of the animal kingdom continuing to thrive in the face of human interference. agent_1:Interesting... but You can't really say they are smarter than us ;) we may be more evil, but we are still smarter :) agent_2:What do you think qualifies (or rather, quantifies) our intelligence?	agent_1:what do You mean ?

9222	agent_1:This government shutdown is not looking great. agent_2:Not at all.  I saw McCarthy next to Trump often.  Do they like each other? agent_1:Paul McCarthy, the singer? Kind of interesting. Paul is a very common name, ever heard of Paul Ryan? agent_2:Paul Ryan was the speaker of the house.  He left. agent_1:Yah. I wonder if he's going to try and run for 2020 election for the GOP. agent_2:I don't know.  By the way McCarthy is House Minority Leader (a republican) agent_1:Ahh. that makes a bit more sense.. lol. agent_2:I guess so.  Ryan tried to shore up his power prior to leaving the house. agent_1:Definitely, I could see that. Although incumbent typically is chosen to represent the prior winning party, I don't know if the GOP is willing to deal with Trump anymore. agent_2:It is weird.  Why were Ryan concerned about its donors not contributing $$?  He was going to leave anyway. agent_1:It's all about having the funds/access to funds.  agent_2:for the republican party in general?   agent_1:Yes. The republican party needs donors so they can properly campaign. I guarantee that the Democrats will get a bit of pool money this year to campaign. We saw this in the 2018 midterm elections. agent_2:Ryan endorsed McCarthy to replace him. agent_1:I thought the current speaker is Nancy Pelosi since they took majority during the 2018 elections	agent_2:It was in case the republican party won the majority.

11777	agent_1:Are you a Lady Gaga fan? agent_2:Yes, musically and as an actress. I just heard a new extended version of a star is born is coming out. I can't wait to see the extra footage. agent_1:I have not seen it at all but I am interested. It got a lot of acclaim. Do you know that Lady Gaga is the godmother of Elton John's son? agent_2:Yes, shes tweeted about him a lot. You should follow her on twitter she has well over 11 million followers and posts all kinds of neat stuff. agent_1:I just recently followed her so I missed a lot. Speaking of, did you also know that the LAPD asked her to tweet her followers about some upcoming roadwork? agent_2:I guess they have a lot less followers. Smart idea! She's come a long way since she was on boiling points. agent_1:I forgot that show existed. I had no idea she was on that. I'm sure she's a bit embarrassed about that now.  agent_2:Maybe, you know it's funny I love her music but she's not really what I'd consider typical to what I listen to. Then I find out her favorite band is Iron Maiden and it makes sense. agent_1:I didn't know about that either. I usually prefer rock as well but I'm not against some catchy pop here and there to get my day going or to work out to. It has it's place for sure.  agent_2:I just wish she'd tour more. I have seen a few of her concerts but there are not that many opportunties. agent_1:You would think she would since that's a lot of the income for singers now. Do you enjoy going to concerts? agent_2:Yes, how about you? I think Linkin Park is the band I've seen the most. They play a lot of shows. Or at least they did :( Sadly there will be no more. agent_1:I used to like it a lot but I don't enjoy the crowds quite as much anymore. I did hear that Linkin Park played 324 concerts in one year. That's insane!	agent_2:Yeah I'm really going to miss Chester. They played some really great venues, I wish there were more dvds.

Did you know the brand ZARA banned the use of animal after an investigation? agent_2:Hello - I did not know that.  agent_1:They were found to throw goats, I understand why people were shocked  agent_2:That's crazy. Did you know pilgrim clothing was full of color? agent_1:Thats so interesting also, I heard they only wore black on special occasions, only humans wear clothing also  agent_2:Yes I saw that as well. There's a store in Alabama that only sells clothes, cameras, etc. that are found in unclaimed baggage.  agent_1:Normally bigger corporations have enough power to make decisions like that. But that's not ethical is it  agent_2:Yea I don't think that's ethical either. agent_1:I think it has a clear link with the use of animals by many companies.... Using fur without consent kinda resembles using unclaimed baggage	agent_2:Yea I think so too. 	agent_1 likes TV show. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV show', 'travel', 'stores'].

In the 1950's a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic because it featured a black character.  What a sad sign of the times back then. agent_1:Did you know the FDA burned 6 tons of literature in an act of censorship.	agent_2:I didn't know that.

About 71% of the Earths surface is covered with water. agent_2:The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands	agent_1:Yes!  The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice.

2747	agent_1:Good morning! Do you know anything about snakes? I saw a huge one on reddit the other day! agent_2:I know that they are elongated and legless reptiles covered in scales. Furthermore, they have highly mobile jaws and usually fangs for venom. agent_1:That's true. My husband pulled one out of my garden. I had never seen it before. It's a rat snake. I guess they are good for killing pests. agent_2:I think rat snakes aren't poisonous? Did you know that the fear of snakes are wired into human brains? I guess people who hate snakes should live in new Zealand since there aren't any there. agent_1:Nope, rat snakes aren't poisonous. They are actually a good kind. I have always believed no snakes should exist, so I believe we are wired for it! agent_2:I wonder what differentiates snakes from legless lizards? agent_1:That is a good question. Maybe that lizards have eyelids and some snakes dont.  agent_2:That makes sense. Personally, I don't mind snakes, although I am wary since venom can be quite potent and dangerous. As long as they aren't flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey are around my area and I can spot them well a head of time, I'm okay. agent_1:flying snakes? My worst nightmare!! agent_2:I guess New Zealand would be ideal for you, with no snakes and all agent_1:True! Do you ever Listen to Taylor Swift? agent_2:I have heard bits hear and there and recently read some articles, but I am not completely familiar. agent_1:She writes a lot of her music about herself. Very popular singer. Who do you listen to? agent_2:Well I do know Kanye did a self mocking skit 2 years before the infamous Taylor swift incident. Other than that, she is among the worlds contemporary artists. agent_1:And she owns a private jet!	agent_2:I recently learn she once accidentally released several seconds of white noise and it somehow topped the Canadian itunes chart.	agent_1 likes music. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'animals', 'music'].

Have you heard of the game Send me to heaven? agent_1:I have , that is the game where people throw their phones as high as they can agent_2:Yeah and that is why Apple had to get in between and ban the game. Pretty stupid one agent_1:Yeah agree. When the iPhone came out Jobs has to have identical ones with him as they kept crashing during the reveal agent_2:Yeah that is pretty cool. Microsoft held a funeral for the iPhone when they revealed theirs agent_1:Yeah that did not go very well because the iPhone sales have sky rocketed agent_2:True. Do you listen to the radio? agent_1:I do sometimes, I listen to Pandora and you? agent_2:Me too, it is a good one. They have a revenue of #274 million but their net income is negative agent_1:Yeah that is strange to me. They now are streaming comedy also agent_2:Yeah they are branching it seems. Did you know Swift removed her music from there? agent_1:Actually she removed it from Spotify because she does not believe it should be free but kept it in Pandora agent_2:Right, not sure if that worked well for her though. Aloe Blacc has 168 million streams in Pandora but only got $12 000 agent_1:THat is nothing for those millions. Do you play video games? agent_2:I used to play Nintendo until it was discontinued in Japan on 2003. agent_1:Yeah. Did you know it only has 54 colors? agent_2:Wow only 54 ?

I dont see it as the supreme achievement in comedy like he does though. agent_2:I was going to ask what you thought about it.  Jack Black was going to star in the Green Lantern which was originally supposed to be a comedy.   agent_1:I think it would have been better as a comedy. I like Jack Black movies. agent_2:I love them!  He cracks me up.  I like corny goofball comedy.  I used to like watching 3rd Rock from the Sun when it was on tv for that same reason. agent_1:Yeah I liked the goofy brother. Dont remember his name. I thought he was funny. agent_2:Yes.  I can picture his face, but can't remember his name either.  That show won a golden globe for best comedy series in 1997. agent_1:considering the other shows that were on at the time that is surprising. agent_2:Yes.  It beat out Seinfeld, Friends, and Frasier. agent_1:Well me personally. I would rather watch third rock any day. Those other shows were quite popular in their day though. agent_2:Yes.  I agree.  Do you know who the highest all time box office star is? agent_1:Yeah its Tom hanks. Over 8.5 billion in the Box office. Thats a lot of money. agent_2:Holy smokes!  You're not kidding!  Did you know Disney's animation studios almost shut down after ""Sleeping Beauty"" was a box office failure? agent_1:It may have flopped in the box office, but it became pretty popular after that. I would say they made a good bit of money off sleeping beauty. agent_2:I would think so too.  However it wasn't their biggest flop.  That would have been ""Treasure Planet"" which was one of the most expensive box office flops of all time! agent_1:I dont think I even saw that one."	agent_2:I remember it, but don't remember seeing it either.

I am kind of frightened that there is a breed of jelly fish that are immortal. Yikes! agent_1:And lobster!  They are immortal in a sense that their organs dont age,  so as long as nothing kills them they can technically live forever.  agent_2:Yuck. I don't like that at all. One of the most interesting fish is the balck swallower fish that can eat prey twice its own length and ten times its weight. Sounds like one of those creepy snakes that eat huge animals. agent_1:Yuck?  Ah you dont like seadfood?  I love eating lobster lol I think that fish black swallow is amazing,  to have the ability to have their body stretch like that,  who knows when their next meal will come along.  agent_2:I am allergic to shellfish...maybe that is it. But can you believe this...  I named my son Fisher. So there is a little love there! agent_1:oh thats too bad, sorry to hear.  Haha Fisher,  thats a great name.  Freshwater fish drink water through their skin! agent_2:Interesting! I just learned that there are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth. Crazy! agent_1:Yeah and they are not even all discovered yet!  theres a bunch undiscovered animals and insects in the amazon rainforest still.  agent_2:The rainforest frightens me. Too many creatures! I can only imagine how many insects are in there!  Did you know that animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated? agent_1:I didnt.  I guess I would never notice because my dog is white lol agent_2:That is funny. My dog has a white patch ...but not on it's forehead!  They say that hiccups are a holdover from early evolution when early land animals had gills and lungs. agent_1:I kinda wish we still had gills lol That would be sweet to swim longer under water.  agent_2:I agree!

I wonder how it felt to have such a physical disability but yet such a sharp mind. agent_1:In his younger years, he wasn't badly afflicted. I wonder whether he was one of the  scientists who theorize that universes evolve through natural selection agent_2:Hmm, it wouldn't surprise me. Hawking went further than Einstein did on understanding of gravity. Hawking developed new graphical methods that let him visualize physics of light paths in warped space, black holes, and the convulsions of the universe. agent_1:And he did all that while battling ALS. There is a theory that there is only one electron in the universe. Does this make any sense? I wonder who came up with that. agent_2:Hmm, it does not to me but I know I'm not much of a scientific mind. Hawking strengthened the Big Bang theory as well that says that the galaxies were in a compressed area smaller than a single atom before the big bang. agent_1:Hard to imagine, but I guess the mathematics supports it. The universe could have come from nothing without violating physics. Particles can pop in and out of existence, so I guess a universe worth could as well. agent_2:Yeah, it's hard for me to relate to scientists and all of their elaborate theories but Hawking was blessed with wit. He was quite the jokester, which makes him very relatable. agent_1:I think he took to his celebrity status quite well. Pixar studio has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities. I wonder if Hawking ever got a chance to see it. agent_2:Speaking of celebrities, did you know that Judge Judy is the highest paid celebrity after lebron james? agent_1:The woman is a legend. Over $100k per episode. Probably a longer career too. But she probably hasn't done any animated voice work. agent_2:I guess celebrities doing voice work is a fairly new thing in terms of history. Robin Williams was the first to start the trend of celebrities doing animated film voices. This was for the movie Aladdin. agent_1:Did he ever appear on Sesame Street? Carol Burnett was the first celebrity to appear on the children's series. He would have been great on that show! agent_2:That is a good question! Do you like celebrity chefs?	agent_1:Not especially.

I can't believe companies thought it would be a flop! agent_1:Yeah can you believe that? Now the franchise of Star Wars is estimated to be worth $65 billion. agent_2:I'm glad 20th century fox finally decided to jump on board with them! My mind is blown, George Lucas says the entire story is told by r2d2! agent_1:Wow I never knew that. Star Wars is the second highest grossing film series of all time. I wonder what the first one is? agent_2:Maybe the Harry Potter movies? I don't think the movie Blade Runner comes close to it haha. Have you seen it? agent_1:Yeah I have seen all the blade runner movies. They are very cool and gritty. Ridley Scott is a good director. agent_2:I still have yet to see one but I want to! I like how the director and Harrison Ford debated if his character was real or not! agent_1:Now that is something that I have thought a lot about as well. That classic line at the end of the first movie delivered by the replicant was actually improvise by the actor. agent_2:I think the whole concept of that movie was done right just by hearing about it! I didn't even know the composer to the soundtrack couldn't read music! agent_1:That is fascinating! Blade runner was the last sci-fi movie to be made completely analog, that is there were no computerized graphics. agent_2:Wow, and now it seems like it's all computerized graphics! Speaking of crazy, isn't earth awesome?	agent_1:Yes earth is epic indeed! When earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long!

But, I haven't been able to afford them in recent years.  agent_1:What type of shoes do you think best for protecting one's feet? agent_2:I think any shoes with good soles are the best for protecting your feet. You need good support.  agent_1:I have little arch in my feet and I am seeking comfortable shoes. Do you have any suggesting?	agent_2:I think the higher end shoes have better support in the soles.

12047	"agent_1:Do you have hope for Pelosi and the democrats in providing balance to the government at this all important time in history. agent_2:I am not very into politics. The modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson. agent_1:Pelosi is the new Speaker of the House. She was not very welcomed in Florida a couple of months back when she was in Florida campaigning for the democrat candidate. agent_2:Why not? Anything in particular? agent_1:She is just not well liked because of her brash personality I presume. agent_2:I see. Did you know There hasn't been a us president who wasn't a republican or a democrat since 1853? agent_1:No, but I would have ventured a similar guess. To add to your point, the colors of blue and red have been used to differentiate the parties since 2000 agent_2:I thought it was longer than that! Every us president with a beard has been a republican. agent_1:Yeah, that was a weird fact. Another similar one would be the fact that Truman refused to be photographed on a ride at Disneyland. agent_2:I heard it was because it was the dumbo ride and so he wouldn't be associated with republicans agent_1:Silly.  We need another tough progressive like Teddy Roosevelt. agent_2:The last time a republican was elected president without a nixon or bush on the ticket was 1928! agent_1:That is quite some time. There are very few conservative democrats left in office. agent_2:The GOP presently hold ""trifectas"" (the executive branch and both chambers of the legislative branch) in a majority of states (26/50), and a ""trifecta plus"" (executive, legislative, and judicial branches) at the federal level, as five of the nine current Supreme Court justices were appointed by Republican presidents. agent_1:I think that might be higher with the confirmation of Kavanaugh recently.  agent_2:Likely! Here's a funny fact; Fox news threatened to sue the simpsons in order to stop them from parodying its famously anti-democratic party agenda. agent_1:Sounds just like fox.  Do you know the republicans actually started out opposing slavery. agent_2:I didn't realize that, no.  agent_1:A small percentage of Tea partiers identify themselves as democrats"	agent_2:I think I heard 15%.	agent_1 likes music. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'politics', 'government structure'].

Did you know pilgrim clothing was full of color? agent_1:Thats so interesting also, I heard they only wore black on special occasions, only humans wear clothing also  agent_2:Yes I saw that as well. There's a store in Alabama that only sells clothes, cameras, etc. that are found in unclaimed baggage.  agent_1:Normally bigger corporations have enough power to make decisions like that. But that's not ethical is it  agent_2:Yea I don't think that's ethical either. agent_1:I think it has a clear link with the use of animals by many companies.... Using fur without consent kinda resembles using unclaimed baggage agent_2:Yea I think so too.  agent_1:Germany was the first country to give rights to animals do you agree with that?  agent_2:Wow I didn't know that. I agree with that though.  agent_1:I do too, but I mean it includes animals like the lochness monster... haha	agent_2:haha.

3891	"agent_1:Hello, did you know the dodo bird is actual a sub-family of the pigeon. agent_2:I didn't know that- of course I believe the bird is extinct, isn't it?  This year we recently had a bunch of hummingbirds..that was a first for me and so exciting. SO TINY.. agent_1:I also find it interesting that some birds can fly from alaska to north america without sleeping when they migrate. agent_2:Birds are very interesting because of a lot of facts.  I think it helps with their flight that their bones are hollow so not weighed down.  agent_1:Yes, they are interesting. I did not know that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. I find that very interersting. agent_2:I have watched them pull some to make them nearby.  The way they flit about is so beautiful to watch.  It is almost elegant like a dance. ..performing art! agent_1:Yes, did you know that Jackie Chan manages a k-pop band. I did not know that but i think it's cool. agent_2:It seems that so many you wouldn't think to have other interests do.  Jackie in music, Bruce Lee in dancing.  A championship even! agent_1:It seems to be in a kpop band you have to be tough because they go through bootcamps before being signed. agent_2:Boot camps for bands.. Guess it takes a lot of stamina for the dancing and singing.  Kind of the same I would assume for figure skating.  Can you imagine the work to land a triple axel? agent_1:That is true. It looks hard. Did you know babies spontaneously dance when they hear music. They are cute. agent_2:Music is a wonderful thing, so much to come out of it.  Symbiotic relationship with dance and music. Tupac was able to do both- never would have thought ballet for him though. agent_1:Yes, that definitely does not fit his image. I was surprised that ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week. That is a lot. agent_2:The tip starts to break down and doesn't hold form.  Same with skates, have to keep them sharp or can't get the edge for spins and jumps. Would have to assume that Nagasu goes through a lot of skates for this reason. agent_1:I like that she wanted to do the triple axel so bad that she dreamed she could . That shows heart for wanting to do something. agent_2:Especially when she had been passed over for the previous Olympics.  Rippon omitted his quad jump at the start, not as much heart I guess. agent_1:And she is part of the record books for being the first U.S. lady to land triple axel in olympic competition. agent_2:She had her wish of making America proud.  Guess the same can't be said for the Russians because of the prior doping scandal. agent_1:Yes, the doping scandal can be hard to come back from. It is amazing the amount of doping in sports today. agent_2:You would think that rather than compromising, like the Olympic committee did, they would just start to ban them.  Isn't teaching them anything to allow certain numbers to still participate and medal. agent_1:That's true. Did you know Michael Jackson had a patent on his leaning dance move. agent_2:I didn't know that there was a device involved in it.  Wonder with his death if the patent transferred to someone? agent_1:Maybe it got passed down to his children. agent_2:He certainly was talented.  Wonder if he did his own choreography? agent_1:I think he did. He worked too hard and I think that is what caused his death. He had his whole family to take care of really. agent_2:So much control.  At least after he left Jackson 5 he had some freedom unlike the kids in K pop. Agencies controlling everything. Yikes! agent_1:That is true and to think K-pop had it's first group of women in the 60's is surprising. I thought k-pop was pretty new. agent_2:I was vaguely familiar with H.O.T. , Korean version of Backstreet Boys. Social networking and YouTube have launched a lot of the Korean Wave. agent_1:Yes and they have the loudest and most loyal fans. agent_2:I wonder if because they are now going global with this music if you will start to see fusion music.  Would mix well with Latin beats. agent_1:I like that when North korea sank a south korean warship they blasted the k-pop song hit your heart on loud speakers. agent_2:I wonder if that song was by their own K pop girl band, moranbong,  or if they selected it from someone else? agent_1:Moranbong  band was  the most popular music group in the country. They must have a lot of fans. agent_2:It is generally classified that way..K Pop.  Seems to have a more narrow sense of description and influence than back when they were around though. agent_1:And they say with social media and tv  shows  k-pop are gaining a widespread global audience. agent_2:To think that   different styles and genres of music can influence modern culture to such an extent as to become an ""idol"" like culture is mind boggling. agent_1:Yes, and I did not realize that when they are in bootcamp they are charged for everything. So when they make it famous they have to pay it all back. agent_2:Just like any other job, pay for the training.  Unfortunately in this instance the control extends beyond all the way to love lives, behavior and diets.  Not for me thank you. agent_1:It is like they control every part of their lives. That would  be very hard especially if they are young. agent_2:Maybe they will evolve, like the birds.  Sprout wings that give them flight.  Would think they would be more like an Ostrich or penguin in comparison..flightless."	agent_1:I think so .	agent_2 likes TV show. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV show', 'music', 'music genre'].

2158	agent_1:Hi, Do you like to cook? agent_2:I love to cook. just not in july when it is so hot. agent_1:Right, it's no fun when it is hot and you're trying to cook. We like to grill a lot outside, which helps not make our home more hot. agent_2:Grilling out is the best to help with the heat inside the house. If I have to cook in the house i do it early in the morning before it gets too hot. agent_1:Yes that's another great idea. We also sometimes eat out if it is way too hot, or eating something like salads or cereal. Where we aren't using heat at all. agent_2:That is a great idea. We tend to eat leftovers too and just use the micorwave. agent_1:The microwave is great and fast, I agree. Making Icecream is a great way to cool down when it gets too hot. We also tend to use box fans. agent_2:We use a fan for sure. Also started using like a slow cooker or toaster oven not as hot and now can fit up to a whole chicken. agent_1:Great appliances help to cook! We love our air-fryer. Though it tends to eat up the area some, so we open the doors and dim the lights to help with the heat. agent_2:I heard some people turn their wrist upside down  to get their blood flowing to stay cool. agent_1:Wow great information, I will have to try that sometime. Do you like to eat fish or even go fishing? agent_2:I love to fish. the oldest goldfish lived to be 43 years old agent_1:Wow that is a long life for a goldfish! I like to go crabbing too. I heard the seahorse is the only fish with a neck, I agent_2:THere was a koi fish that lived 226 years agent_1:Whoa! That is crazy to know and interesting. I know there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal. agent_2:Cool the barreleye fish has a transparent head. agent_1:Awesome. I heard that saltwater fish dink water through their mouths and through their skin, while a freshwater fish only drinks through their skin. Fish are fascinating. agent_2:That is pretty cool. Do you like to bird watch? agent_1:There are times when i Do like to look at the birds, how about you? Did you know that birds bones are really hollow. So hollow in fact that their skeleton weighs less than their feathers. agent_2:thats neat. They have then thousand living species. agent_1:That's cool. Some birds are known to fly from Alaska to mexico without sleeping, that is tiring to think about. agent_2:o wow. I wonder how many days that takes. Scientist say birds have regional accents. agent_1:That is cool how they even have accents like humans. My favorite is the hummingbird, they are tiny sometimes about 2 inches long. agent_2:They are the smallest birds and the ostrich is the biggest. Some birds don't fly. agent_1:This reminds me of the extinct dodo bird.

Supposedly she is the youngest self made billionaire ever. agent_2:Yeah I do not know anything about her.  Did you know there was a dwarf planet between Mars and Jupiter?  I had never heard of it agent_1:Kylie Jenner is one of the Kardashians, I believe. I never knew about the dwarf planet between Mars and Jupiter!

He's just out there. Just like how he thinks AIDS is a man-made disease.  agent_2:I just don't care for him. I would have loved to have been in the courtroom, the day a judge decided to give her ruling to Eminem, in rap style. agent_1:That would have been funny. Speaking of Eminem, did you know that his true dream was to become a comic book artist? agent_2:Yes, Spidey is his favorite. My brother used to love Rugrats when he was little, I only found out recently, that Busta Rhymes voiced the reptar wagon in the movie. agent_1:I didn't know that either. That's pretty interesting. Did you know that Korean rappers invented a new type of freestyle? agent_2:The compliment battle, lol. i would love to hear that. I love how people think the cowboy hat was the most popular in the old west, yet it was really the bowler. agent_1:Yeah, cowboy hats were more as working hats weren't they? Did you know that up until 1998 politicians had to wear a top hat if making a point of order in the House of Commons? agent_2:I did not. That sounds interesting. Much like the ""tip of the hat"" originates from Knights raising their visors. agent_1:That is interesting too. I heard that in 1908 a law was passed limiting the length of hatpins. agent_2:They did that, so they wouldn't be used as weapons. Smart move. agent_1:Yeah it is. I'd hate to be stabbed to death with a hat pin.  agent_2:That does sound like a painful way to die. I do like  the fact that Kanye gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair once. He does have a few redeeming qualities. agent_1:Yeah he does have a few. He once did an SNL skit mocking for interrupting awards shows....2 years before the infamous Taylor Swift incident. agent_2:I have no idea what that is, as I don't pay attention to her either. I still find it mindblowing that Big Sean turned down a scholarship to Michigan, to go rap. agent_1:Yeah that is pretty good. He made a good choice I guess, he's one of the biggest rappers in the world right now. He can always go back. "	agent_2:Big Sean is? Weird, most have never heard of him.

How is that different from a movie? agent_2:You interact with it.  In fact if you ignore it, it taunts you.  Intruders invade and all kinds of things happen.  agent_1:That sounds like a great way to have fun. I bet the story line is pretty good too. You don't kill things or earn points. Is it popular? agent_2:I would guess so, it's on many different consoles. In certain parts of the story there are minefields.  agent_1:I guess I should look into this. Do you use Playstation? agent_2:No.  The most significant thing is that it can have different endings.  agent_1:I don't really play video games much anymore. Do you? Do you use computers much? I do. agent_2:I use computers a lot.  Did you know Windows 95 was the 2nd most installed SW in 1995? agent_1:W95 was huge for its time. It got delayed several times, but it was a big jump for Microsoft. I used it a lot myself. agent_2:Me too.  The first computer algorithm was written by a woman named Ada.  I wonder if that's where the name ADA came from in computing. agent_1:Yes, I believe so. There was a programming language called ADA. I never used it. She was very bright. agent_2:That's what I was saying.  It came from Pascal.  Bell distributed a manual cardboard computer to HS students in 1968 to teach them how that works.  I'd be interested in seeing that. agent_1:I see. Pascal and ADA are related languages. Is it in use now? I wouldn't expect so. agent_2:If I remember right, the gov't was pushing ADA.  There's probably a lot of legacy systems with it.  Did you know the first YouTube video was some dude talking about an elephant...  agent_1:An elephant? Not ADA? LOL. I guess that makes sense. The first upload was probably pretty basic. agent_2:Now there are 79 full episodes of ""The Joy of Painting"" with Bob Ross.   agent_1:Yes, that man is a legend! Encouraged so many people to try painting. There should be a paint program called Ross. agent_2:Yeah.  Did you know the PS3's only have 256MB of RAM?

4817	"agent_1:How familiar are you with the hunting and gathering culture people used to have? agent_2:Not too familiar,      Although I've read a bit from researcher Nicole Kruspe discussing odor. agent_1:Although our sense of smell may not be as developed as some species, odor played an essential role in our survival. However, odor is unique in that people don't name the specific odor itself, but rather what it reminds us of. agent_2:Interesting.   Western scholars dismissed scents as unknowable, or at least unnameable for millenia. agent_1:True, but recent studies by Majid found that the Jahai, who are hunter gatherers still, are able to identify these odors by abstract names. It seems that these hunter gathers & horticulturalists can identify odors, unlike the rest of their world due to their unique cirucmstances. agent_2:True, Kruspe and Majid propose that, when people settle into, say, horticulture or postindustrial society, other senses become relatively more important than smell.  agent_1:McGann states that this ability to distinguish the differences in odor receptors would play a greater role in a more natural, wild environment than the secure urban areas that most horicultural people live. While distinquishing complex smells may save a hunter/gather's life in the wild, it would be as much a life or death situation in most instances in an urban setting. In fact, simple odors like smelling sulfur are enough for most people to avoid dangerous situations. agent_2:Did you know that Humans (taxonomically, Homo sapiens) are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina. agent_1:I recently read that the defining characteristics of Hominina are bipedal locomotion, high dexterity, complex brains, and complex language. agent_2:Early hominins‚ particularly the australopithecines, whose brains and anatomy are in many ways more similar to ancestral non-human apes‚ are less often referred to as ""human."" agent_1:True, but because evolutionary development is progressive, it is diffiult to define cleanly where it is apes stop being apes and became humans instead. Considering some of these early hominins were capable of using fire, displaying high intelligence, I believe they should still be consider humans or at least an early precusor. agent_2:True, they gave rise to anatomically modern Homo sapiens in Africa about 315,000 years ago agent_1:Rather than simply anatomy, I believe the social behaviors and communication is what distinguishes modern human. While most early hominins were capable of using tools, homo sapiens were able to use societys for protection and use their advance communication to capture even the most abstract of concepts for the exponential accumulation and spread of knowledge. agent_2:Did you know that If earth's entire history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds. agent_1:I only happened upon that information on a Did you know? video. What advantages do you believe allowed us to dominate within this small window in history? agent_2:Advantages that explain this evolutionary success include a relatively larger brain with a particularly well-developed neocortex, prefrontal cortex which enable high levels of abstract reasoning and language agent_1:Although early hominins have similar adaptations, what do you believe made us stand out and survive while the others didn't? agent_2:A silly one is that Humans are the only mammals that can't breathe and swallow at the same time agent_1:What purpose do you think this serves? Is it to seperate the lungs and stomach to prevent drowning or getting food in the lungs? agent_2:Perhaps so, although such adaptaptations would be more likely to occur as gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits came to land. agent_1:Speaking of fish, I recently learned that it is negatively labeled as a parphyletic group and not a formal taxonoic group since the classification isn't as clear as perhaps mammals."	agent_2:Fish are pretty amazing.

5429	agent_1:When I was a kid I used to always collect baseball cards. I heard a man found 3 million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic. Have you ever collected baseball cards? agent_2:That's cool.  Sadly, bo I never collected baseball cards.  What about you? agent_1:I love baseball so yes, but none are worth any crazy money. Do you watch baseball at all? agent_2:Yes, I do watch some games.  I read somewhere that managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams, if the need arises.  How wild is that? agent_1:Yeah baseball does have some weird rules. I think its because the sport is so old. My dads favorite team is the cups and they started in 1876! They also had one of the longest droughts ever, 108 years. What is your favorite team? agent_2:My favorite team is the Atlanta Braves and they have been around as long as the Cubs, too.  Both were founded the same year as the Little Bighorn battle.  Wow! agent_1:Both those teams have so much fans. My dad said when the Cubs won in 2016 over 5 million people celebrated in the streets. Have you heard of the cubs curse? agent_2:Yeah, it's pretty funny actually. It started in 1945 when stadium security wouldn't let a man named Billy Sianis stay in the stadium with his smelly pet goat.  agent_1:The best part about baseball is watching the world series. I remember when the red sox came back and beat the Yankees down 0-3. Its crazy how its been going on since 1903. I wonder how many people actually watch it still. agent_2:I think it's still pretty popular.  You know in Japan is so popular, many fans are surprised to discover its status as America's national pastime. agent_1:I dunno because my friend told me that the women's world cup had higher television ratings than the world series. agent_2:Worldwide I think Soccer rules.  But, baseball is still pretty popular, too.  I read somewhere that kickball is called soccer baseball in Canada.  That's kind of strange.	agent_1:Speaking of strange I heard that the cubs have employed a pitcher with 6 fingers.

It must be incase of injury or something. It's a strange rule. Did you hear the story about the man who found a bunch of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic? They were worth 3 million dollars! agent_1:Oh man can you imagine going through stuff and all of sudden you come across a haul like that?! I would probably have a heart attack right then and there. 	agent_2:I couldn't even imagine, I would be so shocked.

Lol agent_1:Yeah fantasy drafts are fun- and even fantasy drafts are done for the national spelling bee! agent_2:I haven't ever done that. There is also a draft for congress. agent_1:Type of people participate in these things? I think it would be boring. A single fold in the brain makes a difference between perceiving reality and fantasy. agent_2:Have you ever heard of terry pratchett agent_1:Yeah I think so I can't believe he was knighted for services to literature.

796	"agent_1:Poetry is an art that is getting forgotten agent_2:It is one of those that I feel like I don't always understand, but love to hear the analysis of and see how deep it can get.  For instance, there is a poem where if you read it one way it's sad, but read it in reverse and it's actually inspirational! agent_1:Wow, I bet that poem required a lot creativity, wrtting a poem with completely different meanings, oposing genres, genius agent_2:There is one guy that wrote a poem of over 220 words in palindrome (where it is the same backwards and forwards -- like ""nurses run"")! agent_1:Sounds really hard, did you ever read one of Edgar Allan Poe's poems? agent_2:I think I read a couple.  I feel like I know them so well because of horror and Halloween stories.  I know ""The Raven"" was pretty popular.  Do you think he made a lot of money with that poem? agent_1:Not really in fact he only made $9 for the publication of that poem, seems really underpaid agent_2:Wow!  That is crazy!  I hope he had a good day job.  Maybe just regular fiction works would have been better financially. agent_1:I hope he did as well, the raven is like his most popular poem and selling it for $9, business was slow, he also wrote cyborg fiction,"	agent_2:That's pretty cool.

13280	agent_1:I built a toy robot once. Have you? agent_2:No, I'd probably electrocute myself if I tried, but it would be cool to have a pet robot agent_1:The company Anki is introducing a small table top companion.  Kind of like Alexa.  The think I built was programmed in basic.  This you talk to. agent_2:Yea, ANki wants a robot in every home, hopefully there is no ulterior motives agent_1:I am sure this thing will collect data while it rolls around the table top.  Kid does not like peas.  Must inform the high command.  The fur child has thrown up again.  Scary the information it will collect. agent_2:Sounds creepy to be honest, a palm sized robot that can crack jokes agent_1:Should a robot have expressive eyes?  I do not want to think of this little thing as feeling.  Remember Rosie from the Jetsons.  Thats what I want.  Smart, dangerous, useful. agent_2:Yea, Vector sounds creepy to me, nudging people's hands for attention agent_1:Honda's Asimo was pretty strange to watch.  It must have been costly. It was pointless as far as I know. agent_2:Yea, I wouldn't pay 1,000 for an Asimo agent_1:I think it cost far more than that.  Anki has a kickstarter to raise funds.  Looks like they will make the $500,000 goal.  Soon the robots will take over the world. agent_2:Maybe that is why Michael Jackson planned to build a 50 foot robot to protect mankind from other mini robots agent_1:Vector will cost $250.  You can buy a lot of them.  Release them into the desert.  Watch the 50 ft tall ones hunt them down.  Make a reality TV show out of it. agent_2:Hopefully Vector is never created using rat brains, then that would be a serious problem	agent_1:It would be a kind of arms race.

I didn't know Nevada is the only state to have a none of the above voting option? agent_2:I think that is a perfect option.  Sometimes there just arent good candidates. agent_1:I agree!! Did you know since 1900 the taller candidate has won by 75%? agent_2:yeah, I guess people think dominance with height?  Not sure how that one works.  And All bearded presdients were republican agent_1:Yes, I heard that too! Good to know the astronauts in space can vote too! agent_2:They can.  And in certain places they might have voted for some animals.  Like a cat named Hank, third place in Virginia senate election agent_1:Oh my goodness! Really. At least we don't have to go into the forest with lions like they do in Indian government! agent_2:I know, id be skipping out on that election. agent_1:I think I would too! Too bad Richard Nixon cracked that 165 year old gavel the senate used. It must be somewhere on display. agent_2:Yeah, that has to be a piece of US history. agent_1:Love the candy desk idea at the senate! Now I'm going to think about them going thru that drawer full of milky ways . mars bars and jelly beans! agent_2:It does sound like the best idea ever.

Do you know how much the first ever Amazon purchase was for? agent_2:No I don't know, do you have any idea, if yes how much was the first purchase? agent_1:Yeah it was for $27.95 and it was for the rights to name a building after themselves.  agent_2:Wow, I will always respect Amazon, because they offer thousandth of people employment rather or not they except it. agent_1:Yeah they do, do you know that the US postal service has a contract with Amazon to deliver on Sundays? agent_2:No I didn't know that, but I notice they Improve their delivery services to only a few days before receiving their packages. agent_1:Yeah they do.  On a different note, do you know much about sharks? agent_2:No, I don't, but I know there are different kind of sharks and they behave in different ways.

Pretty sneaky.  agent_2:I suppose, do you play video games on consoles like the PlayStation? agent_1:I used to play video games a lot as a kid. Don't play now. No time. Little interest.

DO you know how many balls are used during a MLB season? agent_1:Hmm I have no idea but I know that a couple did the schedule for 24 years for those games agent_2:Wow that is a lot and they use 160000 balls per season agent_1:Now that is a low. Did you hear about that guy who made 3 million from old baseball cards? agent_2:WOw no, where did he find all those cards? agent_1:In the attic, they were his grandfather's. How lucky agent_2:I know. A female pitcher at just the age of 17 once took out Babe Ruth and was banned after that agent_1:Wow that is impressive too bad and unfair she got banned though agent_2:Exactly. Women's world cup has more viewers than the Works Series agent_1:Do you know when the World Series was founded? agent_2:Yes that was back in 9013, so over 100 years old now	agent_1:yeah it is pretty old.

I could read a book that was more about the Earth as a whole. The cosmos are fascinating. agent_1:I agree, the cosmos is fascinating and earth is too, so many planets out there, all the wonders they hold	agent_2:I like to think about everything we don't know.

Have you seen the new A star is born with lady gaga and bradley cooper? agent_1:No I have not yet but I am watching it next week with friends. How about you? It rose to fame tso quickly agent_2:I haven't seen it yet either.  I heard it's good and that Bradley Cooper directed it as well as stars in it. agent_1:Yeah there is a lot of buzz. And then you have Lady Gaga on the other hand, they seem to make a great duo. agent_2:That's what I've heard.  They say she is not as good an actress as she is a singer but due to editing the movie makes the most of her singing. agent_1:Yeah, I guess. Apparently she got her name Lady because of a text glitch, from radio. agent_2:I didn't know that. I always wondered where it came from.  I like that she takes care of her fans.  I heard she bought a thousand dollars worth of pizza for fans waiting in line to see her. agent_1:Nice. Even LAPD work with her asking her to tweet that there is road work upcoming because she has so many followers. agent_2:That's pretty cool.  Speaking of cool, did you know that the Foo Fighters played a concert once that was so loud it showed up on new zealands seismic monitors? agent_1:Wow that is amazing. There is an ancient roman amphitheatre in crotia that can still be used for concerts. I wonder if theyhave played there. agent_2:I don't know but it would be great if they did.  That story about lady gaga buying pizza had me thinking about relations with fans.  I heard that a lady on her way to a dave mathews concert stopped to help a cyclist who turned out to be dave mathews!  I bet she got back stage tickets! agent_1:Wow you never know really. Do you attend music concerts much? agent_2:i use too.  Do you?  I would have went to the ABBA reunion tour concert but they turned down a billion dollars to do it. agent_1:I do from time to time. I know some bands do a lot of concerts, like Linkin park did 324 in 2011 alone.	agent_2:Wow, they were some busy people!  I'd like to go to this concert I heard about that was held for dogs.

I adore Tupac, and think it's interesting that the Library of Congress chose his music to be included because it's culturally significant. agent_1:I agree, Kanye's old music was really good. He's just out there. Just like how he thinks AIDS is a man-made disease.  agent_2:I just don't care for him. I would have loved to have been in the courtroom, the day a judge decided to give her ruling to Eminem, in rap style. agent_1:That would have been funny. Speaking of Eminem, did you know that his true dream was to become a comic book artist? agent_2:Yes, Spidey is his favorite. My brother used to love Rugrats when he was little, I only found out recently, that Busta Rhymes voiced the reptar wagon in the movie. agent_1:I didn't know that either. That's pretty interesting. Did you know that Korean rappers invented a new type of freestyle? agent_2:The compliment battle, lol. i would love to hear that. I love how people think the cowboy hat was the most popular in the old west, yet it was really the bowler. agent_1:Yeah, cowboy hats were more as working hats weren't they? Did you know that up until 1998 politicians had to wear a top hat if making a point of order in the House of Commons? agent_2:I did not. That sounds interesting. Much like the ""tip of the hat"" originates from Knights raising their visors. agent_1:That is interesting too. I heard that in 1908 a law was passed limiting the length of hatpins. agent_2:They did that, so they wouldn't be used as weapons. Smart move. agent_1:Yeah it is. I'd hate to be stabbed to death with a hat pin.  agent_2:That does sound like a painful way to die. I do like  the fact that Kanye gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair once. He does have a few redeeming qualities. agent_1:Yeah he does have a few. He once did an SNL skit mocking for interrupting awards shows....2 years before the infamous Taylor Swift incident."	agent_2:I have no idea what that is, as I don't pay attention to her either.

This year we recently had a bunch of hummingbirds..that was a first for me and so exciting. SO TINY.. agent_1:I also find it interesting that some birds can fly from alaska to north america without sleeping when they migrate. agent_2:Birds are very interesting because of a lot of facts.  I think it helps with their flight that their bones are hollow so not weighed down.  agent_1:Yes, they are interesting. I did not know that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. I find that very interersting. agent_2:I have watched them pull some to make them nearby.  The way they flit about is so beautiful to watch.  It is almost elegant like a dance. ..performing art! agent_1:Yes, did you know that Jackie Chan manages a k-pop band. I did not know that but i think it's cool. agent_2:It seems that so many you wouldn't think to have other interests do.  Jackie in music, Bruce Lee in dancing.  A championship even! agent_1:It seems to be in a kpop band you have to be tough because they go through bootcamps before being signed. agent_2:Boot camps for bands.. Guess it takes a lot of stamina for the dancing and singing.  Kind of the same I would assume for figure skating.  Can you imagine the work to land a triple axel? agent_1:That is true. It looks hard. Did you know babies spontaneously dance when they hear music. They are cute. agent_2:Music is a wonderful thing, so much to come out of it.  Symbiotic relationship with dance and music. Tupac was able to do both- never would have thought ballet for him though. agent_1:Yes, that definitely does not fit his image. I was surprised that ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week. That is a lot.	agent_2:The tip starts to break down and doesn't hold form.  Same with skates, have to keep them sharp or can't get the edge for spins and jumps.

Maybe the system still needs to be developed. Up until 1918 not all men in UK had the vote. agent_2:Right i heard that. Did you know astronauts get to vote from space?  agent_1:Neat! And in India they even set up a voting booth for one voter in area saturated with lions. agent_2:Guess they did want him to vote. That sounds unusually cruel.  agent_1:I wonder if in India they vote what to name their garbage dumps. In Austin, Texas they voted to name theirs after Fred Durst.	agent_2:Wow that is to funny, i wonder why?

If you think about it, a lot of power comes from water.  agent_2:Yes such as hydropower. Apple computer's seem to be quite sensitive because if you smoke near an Apple Computer it voids the warranty. agent_1:Interesting. That doesn't sound true, but I wonder if it is the same for the iphone? agent_2:I don't know what you mean? There is a group called transhumanist's that want to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks! agent_1:That sounds pretty cool. I would do it, would you?  agent_2:I don't know sounds kind of creepy to me! Almost like the work of fiction! Like something from someones imagination! agent_1:I think it would be pretty cool. Do you play minecraft?  agent_2:I have in the past. Kind of amazing someone built a working computer using only the mine craft building blocks. agent_1:Yeah, that is pretty crazy. I'm not even sure how that is possible?  agent_2:Me neither. I also don't know how the space shuttles general-purpose computer runs on 1 Mb of RAM. agent_1:I'm not sure either. It seems like a small amount of ram.  agent_2:Yes it does. Do you like reading fiction? I kind of like reading things that are not based on history or facts. agent_1:I'm not a huge fan of fiction. Did you know there is a wiki that ranks fictional characters based on powers?  agent_2:I would like to see that. Edgar Allan Poe wrote the oldest known example of cyborgs in fiction. agent_1:That would be pretty cool. I wonder what the best fictional character is on the wiki?  agent_2:Yes I bet superman is up there. Probably Thor too. Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Hercules in his youth. He definitely got started early. agent_1:Superman definitely has to be up there if not number one. Well nice chatting with you! agent_2:A judge in the 1950s tried to ban a work of science fiction because it featured a black character. Glad times have changed.

I actually have a bird feeder and pond in my back yard that attracts them quite often.  Even get some hummingbirds during warmer weather.  It's kinda neat that they steal spiderwebs to repair their nests. agent_1:Ingenious little tweeters!  Except perhaps for the Dodo bird, a less-than-successful member of the pigeon family.	agent_2:I didn't know they were from the pigeon family.  i wonder if they were trying to fly without sleeping like some birds do.when migrating and couldn't figure it out.

I wonder how that happened and none got there accidentally like on plane rides. agent_1:Yeah, you would think over time some would have gotten there.  Even stranger are that there are actually flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey. agent_2:I wonder where those are?  I hope not to see those!  The fear of snakes certainly is hard-wired into not only monkey brains but my brain too! agent_1:I never really knew monkeys were afraid of snakes, but I guess it makes sense.  I wonder if they are also afraid of the legless lizards that aren't snakes.  Sounds similar to me.	agent_2:Could be! Did you know that crocodiles are more closely related to birds than snakes and lizards?

524	agent_1:Hello, How are you? Do you like politics? agent_2:Im well.  I do like politics, I just find our current climate a bit hostile. agent_1:lol, I agree with you!! I didn't know Nevada is the only state to have a none of the above voting option? agent_2:I think that is a perfect option.  Sometimes there just arent good candidates. agent_1:I agree!! Did you know since 1900 the taller candidate has won by 75%? agent_2:yeah, I guess people think dominance with height?  Not sure how that one works.  And All bearded presdients were republican agent_1:Yes, I heard that too! Good to know the astronauts in space can vote too! agent_2:They can.  And in certain places they might have voted for some animals.  Like a cat named Hank, third place in Virginia senate election	agent_1:Oh my goodness! Really.

I understand that it's popular. agent_1:Fox discussed the possibility of creating a cable channel that would only air the Simpsons. agent_2:That is an idea that might work, but now I figure people are on the Internet. Maybe a YouTube channel? agent_1:Possibly...The gaming website IGN is actually owned by Fox News. agent_2:Oh, I didn't know that. I guess Fox owns a lot of things out there. A gaming site? Hm. agent_1:Yea very interesting. Fox News is watched more than CNN and MSNBC combined. agent_2:I believe it. CNN has its own bias, as does MSNBC. People watch what they want to believe. agent_1:Yep, not a huge fan of CNN because they post so much fake news and are very biased. agent_2:I don't watch CNN. What kind of fake news? agent_1:They just report things that are fake or swayed to the liberal spectrum of politics. Fox News was created by Richard Ailes and Richard Nixon. agent_2:The viewership of Fox skews pretty old. In 2015, the median viewer age was 68 years old. Older people tend to be more conservative. agent_1:That is very old. Did you know there hasn't been a president who wasn't a rep or dem since 1853? agent_2:The two party system is frustrating because the choices are limited. The money backs certainly candidates, and there is little possibility for outsiders to get in. agent_1:I agree. Every president with a beard has always been a republican. agent_2:I guess that imparts a look of sage wisdom and manliness.  	agent_1:I guess so lol. The last time a republican was elected president without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was back in 1928.	agent_2 likes history. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['history', 'hobbies', 'woodworking'].

I think they believed that elections would lead to an oligarchy.  agent_1:I wonder how that would work today though. agent_2:Yeah I don't think that would work very well, but then again, maybe it would work better, who knows.  agent_1:yeah there is no knowing there. In Nevada they have a none of these candidate options in the ballot. agent_2:Yeah I heard that there were some wild results in the Nevada elections this year.  agent_1:I did not know about that one. not a lot of people seems to vote though since less than 63 people go out and vote agent_2:Isn't that pretty sad, I guess it hasn't breached that 63% barrier in the last 100 years! agent_1:yes it is because it is a right and we are not using it to its best. agent_2:That is true.  Did you know that the taller candidate has won the presidential election 75% of the time? agent_1:hahaa I really wonder if that has any correlation with how people perceive the candidates agent_2:Yeah I guess it must, because that is just way too high to just be chance.  agent_1:did you hear that international electoral observers were blocked from polls in nine states in 2012 agent_2:No I didn't hear that, I wonder why they stopped doing that?  agent_1:maybe they did not trust them, i have no idea. do you know when republicans and democrats started using red and blue? agent_2:No I don't, but probably more than 100 years ago or so, do you know?	agent_1:It was actually as recently as 2000 so not very long ago.	agent_2 dislikes history. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['history', 'politics', 'no'].

If you went on Mount Everest would you take a selfie at the top? Apparently they have 3-g service there agent_2:That would be great, taking a selfie in the top of the tallest mountain, I didnt know you could get addicted to the internet agent_1:I did know that, I'm probably addicted right now haha. And yes if you use the internet too much you can get addicted to clicking links agent_2:That is just crazy, its a good thing there a copy stored in the library of Alexandria, I cant imagine my life without the internet now agent_1:No I agree with you. I wonder how often they back it up at the Alexandria library though? Do you believe that there is extraterrestrial life in the galaxy? agent_2:I do, we are not alone in the world, the universe is so big that there must be alien life in other planets, galaxies agent_1:Yes I think you're right. Have you heard of the Drake equation? It's an equation that calculates the probability that life exists outside of hours in the universe and I think that it has determined that there should be life there somewhere agent_2:No havent heard of it, and then I agree with that equation, there are firefighters that are trained on how to treat aliens in case of a crash or an invasion	agent_1:Well that's pretty cool. Did you ever hear of the show X-Files?

With the length of that show, and it's weekly showing there must be lots of now famous people that have been on it. agent_2:probably, he also made a cameo in the movie wedding crashers agent_1:Interesting that if you are born around the Panama canal you can be American, do we lease or own the land for the canal.  I know we pretty much built it. agent_2:not sure, mccains mom is still alive and took race car driving classes in her late 90's! agent_1:They sound like an adventurous family, he must have got his courage from his mom. agent_2:yeah! speaking of politics, voter turnout for presidential elections has not breached 62% in the last 100 years agent_1:That's kind of sad, people can't complain if they don't vote,  In some countries, Australia for instance, you get fined for not voting.

10288	"agent_1:I just read a section on comedy which states that the python program was partly named after Monty Python. I love how they did that! agent_2:Yeah the programming language I think is what you mean. Classic comedy. Kung Fu Hustle is a brilliant comedy also. agent_1:I've actually never seen it, whats it about?  agent_2:It's a wacky cartoony slapstick comedy. Bill Murray loves the movie too. agent_1:i'll add it to my list of movies to watch. Bill Murray is such a great comedian, unfortunately I don't think he's been in movies as of late. Green lantern is on my list of movies to watch too, weird to think that it was initially going to be a comedy agent_2:Yeah I think Jack Black was supposed to star. Hard to believe that 3rd Rock beat Seinfeld for best comedy in '97 at the golden globes agent_1:I've actually never even seen an episode of 3rd rock. Seinfeld was revolutionary, are you more of a Seinfeld or Friends fan? agent_2:Seinfeld by far. Friends doesn't hold up very well for me. I wonder if it would have been one of the 100 shows Comedy Central cancelled over the years if it had been on that channel. You? Friends or Seinfeld? agent_1:perhaps! I'm actually more of a Friends fan myself lol. It's interesting how much tv shows and movies have changed over the years. Even just through more advanced filming abilities and styles. Shout out to James Wong for pioneering the use of wide-angle lenses amongst other things agent_2:He was quite the pioneer despite the racism. agent_1:he had a lot to overcome and still won an Oscar. I've read in other articles that the Oscars are pretty racist too, not recognizing talented individuals due to their race.  agent_2:There are definitely some problems. A woman has never won best cinematographer, or even been nominated. agent_1:that's some crazy stuff. It even must be frustrating with Roger Daekins for being nominated 13 times and never having won agent_2:And the guy who was supposed to be the cinematographer for Spartacus didn't actually do the work and won the academy award. agent_1:I'd be pretty angry if that happened to me lol. Have you heard of Gavin Free before reading about him? agent_2:Yeah he did slo-mo cinematography on Hot Fuzz. agent_1:interesting, Hot Fuzz was a good movie. I thoroughly enjoy comedies agent_2:Yeah it was. Comedy is a great art form. It all started back in ancient Athens. agent_1:Its interesting how the change of definition of ""planet"" meant that Pluto was no longer a planet.  agent_2:I'm still bitter about that. I never want to visit the one that rains shards of glass at 4500mph. agent_1:thats such an unusual characteristic of a planet. Sounds like complete chaos there lol AND it's 2000 degrees farenheit. insane. agent_2:Maybe we'll make it to Ganymede someday. It's a Jupiter moon big enough to be a planet.

Maybe that's why married men go grey... agent_2:Thats funny, that would make sense, animals have constitutional rights in Germany agent_1:Did you know that hiccups are an early evolution from land animals. agent_2:I guess we are all animals and another fact that supports evolution,  agent_1:Did you hit enter prematurely?!?!? I do that more than I would like to admit. I wonder what the loch ness monster evolved from. agent_2:I did, I hate it when that happens, and I have no idea, good thing Nessie is a protected species. Since 1912 at least. agent_1:How long do loch ness monsters live for? How many are there? I have questions! I do not need answers though. I would like to know more about a sound frequency that causes fear in humans. I have enemies I need to vanquish! agent_2:Well Nessie is a myth, hopefully one day we can find out if the myth is true or not, and thats sounds interesting didnt know there was a fear frequency for humans. agent_1:Me either. Did you know we may have lost all of our body hair as recently as 240000 years ago? As a swimmer, I still see a lot of hairy humans! agent_2:I guess many of them didnt lose it lol, there are some hairy humans out there I agree with you agent_1:Did you know ribs grew back? That's crazy! How come other bones don't grow back? I broke my arm and that didn't grow back. agent_2:I didnt know that, how long does it take for them to grow back? and that sounds painful agent_1:I wonder if they regrow in other animals like horses? agent_2:Not sure about that, but that is an intersting question do you like horses? agent_1:I do like horses but I am a little afraid of them.

Drew Goddard directed it as well! agent_2:A B movie? Great! that sounds fun. low budget? doesnt take itself too seriously?	agent_1:Exactly. So are you a horror fan in general?

Are you a big user of Netflix? agent_1:I am a big user, I have an account and use it almost every day, mostly after 9pm, what about you? agent_2:No I don't have an account currently.  So you are one of those that make up using all that bandwidth during peak hours lol.  agent_1:I am a part of that group, yes, lol, its also YouTubes fault as they together with netflix they take upon half of the internet traffic agent_2:Yeah I can totally see that, YouTube is so popular among younger people it's crazy to me.  agent_1:It is really popular, just like Netflix is, its amazing how the service has 137 million subscribers around the globe agent_2:And that number is still growing, thats so many.  But, it is quality stuff, you get access to an insane amount of content.  agent_1:I agree, you get more than what you pay for, I used to spend a lot of money on rentals and those late fees were a real pain to pay agent_2:Yeah I think that is why Hastings started the company in the first place, he was in your same shoes.  agent_1:Could be, so he must hate Star Wars then, do you like the franchise? agent_2:Yeah I grew up watching the movies years ago when I was a kid, I still think the ones from the late 70's/early 80's are the best ones.  How about you? agent_1:I do too, I think old movies are the best ones, I love Star Wars personally, I dont like the new movies as much though,  agent_2:Yeah I'm the same way when it comes to that.  It is hard to replicate, and I know the Star Wars fans are so hardcore and hard to please as well! agent_1:Yeah I agree with you, its amazing how much the franchise is worth though, 65 billion dollars!! agent_2:Yeah that is an insane amount.  I wonder how much it was worth back in the 1990's? agent_1:I bet not much, at least at the beggining 20th Century Fox didnt have much faith in the movie, that lack of faith cost them millions agent_2:Yeah they dropped the ball, Disney sure spent a bunch but i'm sure it will all pay off in the long run.  agent_1:They need to improve the movies, have more jedis in them, do you like Transformers? agent_2:Yeah I agree with that for sure.  No, I have only seen about 5 mins of one of the films.  How about you? agent_1:I like the series, I thought the first movie back in 2007 was the best one though and didt like the The Last Knigh premiered in 2017	agent_2: I will have to check that one out sometime then.

I have an iphone but never use siri, I would rather just google something instead to be honest. agent_2:I'm not really daring, LOL.

I hope he had a good day job.

Fur is the covering of hair used to protect an animal and help it control its temperature and reactions to the climate. agent_1:ok... I've never thought about it this way... agent_2:I think once you adjust your mindset and realize how close we are to modern-day animals, you begin to change how you think of the animals themselves. agent_1:We are modern days animals ? how so... we just sit all day and look at the monitor :) agent_2:We're not just modern-day animals. We ARE animals. Homo sapiens are part of Hominina, which is a subtribe of Animalia (how we classify animals). agent_1:Well at least from a name , ok, but we are logical, spiritual and very intelligent... I don't know if one can call us animals :) agent_2:I disagree. I think animals are also very logical and intelligent. If you think about it, they are smarter than us. Humans are responsible for destroying the planet - and not only are we aware of that, we are consciously choosing to continue! agent_1:...but the fact that we are self-aware should make us something more than animals... agent_2:Animals are very much self-aware. They can plan for the future and cater their reactions to their environments. That is why you see so much of the animal kingdom continuing to thrive in the face of human interference. agent_1:Interesting... but You can't really say they are smarter than us ;) we may be more evil, but we are still smarter :) agent_2:What do you think qualifies (or rather, quantifies) our intelligence? agent_1:what do You mean ? No other animal can understand math on level we can... agent_2:What do we use math to understand? Quantity and calculations? How do you think animals know how much food to store for winter, or which directions to migrate, or how to account for tides when navigating in the ocean? agent_1:sure they are not stupid, but they won't build a computer processor... agent_2:Why do they need a computer processor? Animals have survived and thrived without electricity or any of the modern conveniences humans consider ""essential"" to our survival. I think the real sign of intelligence is the ability to not only survive but thrive in the face of challenges, and animals (excluding homo sapiens) have not only succeeded but excelled in doing so - all without damaging the Earth/locations for other species. agent_1:we don't talk about what they need or not, but about a fact they won't be able to build one because they don't understand high level calculations...."	"agent_2:Why build what you don't need? Perhaps they have their own versions of technology. I don't think you can quantify or even compare human ""intelligence"" to that of the rest of the animal kingdom."	agent_1 dislikes technology. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['technology', 'TV show', 'documentary'].

I like Edgar Allen Poe. I know watching horror movies can burn up to 180 calories! agent_1:Interesting. So instead of going to the gym, you just sit there and watch the movies?  agent_2:Right! Did you know Bambi terrified Stephen King. agent_1:I'm not surprised, Bambi does die in the end.  agent_2:I'm glad. I know if you watch a horror movie before you view abstract art you will enjoy the art more. agent_1:Interesting, any type of specific artists, or just abstract art?  agent_2:I think just abstract art.  agent_1:Ok, I wonder why that is. Any ideas as to why this occurs?  agent_2:None at all. It's hard to believe Danny the boy from the shining did not know he was acting in horror film. agent_1:Interesting. I didn't know that. Did you know that they have fantasy draft spelling bees?  agent_2:No, I did not. A single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving reality and fantasy.  agent_1:Interesting, I didn't realize that. Have you heard of the fantasy called ""In the Realms of the Unreal?"" agent_2:No, what is it about? agent_1:It's apparently a fantasy, but I'm not sure what it is about.  agent_2:Oh, okay. I know fantasy has evolved into various media including film, TV, graphic novels and more! agent_1:Wow! That is really cool. What about Thor, have you seen it? "	agent_2:I have heard of Thor.

Freddie mercury used the same piano to record bohemian rhapsody as paul mccartney used to record hey jude agent_2:cool! ever hears of Eurovision? agent_1:No, what's that? agent_2: Song Contest in england. agent_1:Oh ok.  In 2006 a group of climbers reached the top of britain's highest mountain and found a piano agent_2:neat! apparently the competition away from its usual reliance on over-the-top spectacle. agent_1:An aluminum grand piano was built for the lounge of the airship hindenburg. it weighed only 356 pounds. agent_2:Wow! I did not know that!

Some dogs in Moscow have learned to use the subway! agent_1:Well those dogs are definitely smarter than me lol. Dogs aren't color blind either, just don't see the same thing we see! agent_2:I wonder why they always have said they are? lol  I always find it amusing how a dog drinks with the underside of their tongue. agent_1:That is so cool. Dogs are so smart for sure! Dogs and elephants are the only animals that understand pointing. agent_2:Cool!  Russia has a tomb of the unknown dog as a memorial for canine research subjects.  Kind of sad. agent_1:It really is. I just love dogs haha. Did you know in Hawaii the office attire of choice is the aloha shirt? Talk about comfy! agent_2:Nice!  Sign me up!  lol  At Billy Mays funeral the pallbearers wore blue shorts and khaki pants.  Kind of casual and different. agent_1:RIP Billy Mays! I like how polo shirts were originally invited for tennis players. agent_2:I didn't know that!  I know the tshirt was invented in 1904 and was marketed to bachelors who couldn't sew or replace buttons. agent_1:That would be the market I would have been in back then haha. I wish I would have invented the Ugg boots back then too haha. agent_2:Yes!  When we're they created?""  I think they have been around since the 1800's? agent_1:They were actually invented by surfers to keep their feet warm on the beach after surfing!"	agent_2:Nice.

I would love to go to one soon. agent_1:Wow you've never been to a concert? you need to go to one ASAP LOL, maybe go to a The Ramones concert Sunday? Apparently they've been touring for almost 20 years straight, I bet their show is really good agent_2:That is crazy! My mom really likes them, maybe I'll be able to take her.  agent_1:Yes you should! She would love it LOL. I would also go to a Linkin Park concert, although I think they're singer passed away, back in 2001 they did like 324 concerts in only a year, that's like one per day almost agent_2:I grew up listening to Linkin Park and it hurt me when I found out Chester died. That is a lot of concerts, wow.  agent_1:Yep I agree with you. Would you ever watch a concert in an ancient Roman Amphitheater? Apparently Pink Floyd did a concert there, and there is one in Croatia that still does concerts to this day agent_2:That is insane, I think I would watch it just to experience it. I don't know if you know who Creed is, but apparently they were sued by four concert goers because their 2002 concert was really bad. agent_1:That's pretty funny haha. I would actually be embarrassed if I were them, do you play any instruments by the way? I personally play the piano agent_2:I know right! I don't really play any instruments, I use to play on a piano when I was a kid though. agent_1:Yeah I play the piano, I start to learn as an adult, I actually like it a lot. I didn't know that back in 1930, there was a day where there was literally no news and so the BBC just played piano music instead haha agent_2:Oh cool, I'm glad you enjoy it.

It's animated, right? With lots of songs? agent_2:Yes it uses computer animation and it has love songs. It was super popular. There's a song that all the little kids were saying called""Let It Go and I guess it's based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale called the snow queen agent_1:HC wrote so many great stories. I read the Snow Queen a long time ago. I don't remember it.Has the movie won any awards? agent_2:I'm pretty sure that it has, I know that it made a ton of money. Apparently the villain used to sing that song I mentioned, Let It Go, but the song was so happy that they changed the character agent_1:that's good thinkg. I bet the song is up for an award somewhere. Who were the people involved in the film? agent_2:There's like a princess, a reindeer and a snowman, they're like them three most important characters. Also this is the first movie that was produced by Walt Disney and directed by a woman. agent_1:Not many films get directed by woman. That's good that she got the job. Good for Disney! They know how to spot talent. agent_2:I think so. Apparently she was the first female director of a film that earned over 1 billion dollars too. So that is another record that she set agent_1:Disney has won a ton of awards, and I'm sure she'll win awards as well. agent_2:Oh I'm Sure. Do you like dogs by the way? We used to have a husky ourselves agent_1:A dog is a great friend, but no, I have never had a dog. I enjoy playing with them though. agent_2:Dogs are awesome, I think anyway, they have like 12 different blood types and apparently there are dog blood drives that exist agent_1:I wonder how the dogs are rewarded at the drive. People get cookies and orange juice. agent_2:I know right? I hope that the dogs get a treat at least haha. Did you know that Istanbul has vending machines that reward stray dogs for bringing back trash? agent_1:The Turks know the value of recycling and that dogs are keen to help for reward. agent_2:Oh for sure!

Do you watch the world cup? agent_2:No, but my boyfriend has been trying to get me to. He said I should start with women's soccer because the female US team hasn't placed lower than third since they started in 1991. agent_1:Despite the US not being as supportive of soccer as other sports, the us teams have done amazingly well in the world cups as you mentioned agent_2:Yeah, but i think Americans are getting tired of some of the US only sports. Soccer makes more money than football, basketball, baseball and golf combined. agent_1:That is because soccer is the most popular internationally agent_2:I asked my boyfriend why it's called soccer here and he said it was slang for association football in the states. agent_1:Honestly, football and american football confused the heck out of me when I was younger. Calling it soccer made it easier agent_2:Maybe they should just call American football :stupid ball"" and get it over with. I heard the city set to host the fifa in 2022 doesn't even exist yet. agent_1:True many countries want to host despite no immediate economic benefits agent_2:That's really surprising, I heard there are no disceernable economic benefits to host the Olympics either. I guess the whole process is so taxing to the economy and people. agent_1:Perhaps but it also provides prestige, advertisement, tourism, and jobs so I guess it is worth it agent_2:I like that some of the players are altruistic at least, even if sports is mostly about money.

The only thing I know about it, is that it's a drama show. agent_1:I've watched it a few times, it's a pretty good show.I've never seen the National Geographic show called Game of lions, though.  Have you? agent_2:No, I can't say that I have. I haven't even heard of that either. What did you like about Game of Thrones? agent_1:I like fantasy type shows and this one has a large cast with several plot lines going on at the same time.  It holds your interest and is never boring. Scenery is beautiful, it gets filmed in Ireland, Canada Iceland, Malta Scotland, Spain, and the U.S. agent_2:I think the only guy I really know from the show is Peter Dinklage because he won an Emmy for being on the show. agent_1:Well. Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter plays Talis on the show, also. agent_2:That is interesting! The show comes on HBO right? I'll have to check it out sometime. agent_1:Yes, it does.  Just binge watch it, all seven seasons.  The eighth season doesn't premiere until April, so you have some time to get up to speed, it's worth watching! agent_2:Eight seasons? That means it came out in 2011. That is a long time for a show to be on and still being successful. agent_1:Yeah, that long.  It has a big following, so much so that Arya the name of one of the characters is the fastest rising baby name for girls in the U.S. agent_2:That is a little disturbing. Not sure I would name my kid from a TV show. I think the actor that played Arya was actually her first role in anything. agent_1:I know right.  I wouldn't either, but some people are very big fans. Lol agent_2:I'm not that big of a fan of anything. Lots of celebrities are overrated. In 2007 Paris Hilton was voted the most overrated celebrity. agent_1:Me either and I remember when Paris Hilton was everywhere.  I wish the Kardashians would go the same way.  They are way overrated, as well.   agent_2:Yeah, the Kardashians are the very definition of celebrity. They garner so much public attention by mass media and I have no clue what they are actually known for.	agent_1:I don't think nobody does.

Earth has one natural satellite is Moon. The earth receives its light and heat from the sun. agent_2:Yeah and scientists say that earth will be virtually helium free by the end of the 21st century1 Crazy! agent_1:The earth spins on its own axis it causes for the day and night changes.

Disney released the first trailer for next year for the Lion King remake. agent_2:That's correct. Disney is calling the new Lion King remake a live action film but it relies almost exclusively on CGI so a lot of people consider it annimation. agent_1:I do too. A related debate arose when Avatar was released, with the Visual Effects Society honoring James Cameron's 2009 epic for, among other trophies, animated character in a live-action feature motion picture agent_2:I agree that these kinds of films are skirting the line between traditional annimation and heavily CGI assisted live action films. With the improvements in the technology I'm not sure it makes sense anymore to feel the need to classify such films in the traditional modes. agent_1:Yeah I feel the same way of course Jon Favreau, the director of the Lion King remake has naturally walked down this valley before, with his update of The Jungle Book.  agent_2:Yes, the difference being that the Jungle Book still had a human character and therefore a true live action person was seen on screen. The Lion King contains no humans and so it is likely that everything is CGI. agent_1:Technology is all consuming. During the 70s, disney recycled a lot of their animation frames, resulting in identical scenes in some movies agent_2:That was a different time, generating those frames took so long that it made sense to recycle those that you could. Creation is a much quicker process now with the aid of computer programs. agent_1:Did you know that Frozen was the first animated Disney film directed by a woman. agent_2:Yes I had heard that. Disney does a good job trying to increase representation in their films and parks when possible.

Probably most fans would want a winning team.  agent_2:Probably, they can always let their baseball manager play as they are technically allowed to play agent_1:That's a funny rule, isn't it. It must be a holdover from early days when a player also served as manager. agent_2:Yea, I remember back in the 1970s when Pete Rose was a manager he would sometimes play in the games too agent_1:Pete really was a competitive guy. He also bet against his team sometimes though.  agent_2:Yea that's not good. I have old Pete Rose baseball cards but they're not worth 3 million like the cards a man found in his grandfather's attic agent_1:That guy must not have been able to believe his luck. I wonder what he did with the cards. I would have sold half and kept half. Money now, plus a long-term investment. agent_2:I'd take a trip to Japan where baseball is also very popular agent_1:The baseball there is just not as good as in the US. Still, it's a difference experience at the stadium. It's an interesting lesson in cultural difference. agent_2:I'd like to visit England too, it's funny how until 1998 their politicians had to wear a top hat in the house of commons agent_1:I guess rules get held over for the sake of tradition.

Baseball is a pretty popular sport in Japan.   agent_1:Yeah i hear they think it should be their pastime. I wonder if a manager has ever jumped into a game.  agent_2:They can if need be.  There are some major baseballs fans out there! agent_1:Yeah unfortunately I do not have the patience for it. Kickball is called soccer baseball in Canada.  agent_2:That's a funny term in my opinion!  There was one person who found 3 million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic.  He  hit a gold mine! agent_1:Right, why can't stuff like that happen to me, lol. Up until 2005 a married couple was responsible for scheduling all 2430 major league games.  agent_2:Dang that sounds like a busy life scheduling all that!  One thing I like from baseball is they get to wear hats.  Do you like hats? agent_1:Love hats, all kinds my friend. How about you?  agent_2:Yep I do also!  Fun little fact about in the Old West, the Cowboy hat was not the most popular.  The Bowler hat was, whichever that looks like! agent_1:Yeah police wear distinct hats usually peaked caps or brimmed hats, like the mounties.  agent_2:Yep their hats are noticeable!

It was Bradley Cooper's directorial debut. agent_1:I will definitely check that out! Her favorite band is Iron maiden, I wouldn't have guessed that! agent_2:I wouldn't have guess that either. She apparently has a 11.4 million followers on Twitter. agent_1:That seems more assumable! She was also asked by the lapd to tweet them about some roadwork once! agent_2:Oh wow I have never heard of followers being used like that. Elton John chose Lady Gaga as his son's godmother. I didn't know they were close. agent_1:I didn't either! Do you remember the show boiling points on MTV? Lady gaga was on it before she was famous.  agent_2:Yes I vaguely remember that show. I will have to look it up. She's one of the best selling music artists in history now. I bet she reminisces on those boiling point days. agent_1:Absolutely! Speaking of famous artists, Queens guitarist has a phd in astrophysics!  agent_2:Yeah I remember that from the movie Bohemian Rhapsody, did you see it? He also uses coins as guitar picks. agent_1:I didn't see that one either, i'm really behind on movies it seems!

Maybe one of us will win soon, it hasn't happened since 1853. agent_2:Well I am just hoping Trump doesn't win a second term next year, but with how corrupt everything is now it is looking like a very likely outcome. agent_1:I do too, I don't particularly like him. Did you vote last election agent_2:I did, I voted Hillary even though I didn't really care for her either, but she was a much better choice than what we ended up with. agent_1:For sure, I voted third party. I was part of the problem, I wanted a 3rd party to win because it has been years! agent_2:Well Bernie Sanders just announced his 2020 run, so if he actually makes it onto the ballot this year I will vote for him. agent_1:Yea, he got taken out of the running in 2016 by hillary. I am voting BIDEN! agent_2:If Biden decided to run in 2020 i would probably choose him over Bernie, I always liked him when he was VP. agent_1:For sure, and he would take Trump down. agent_2:I am not sure anyone can take Trump down at this point, with all the rumored election rigging and ties to Russia, I personally think he will just cheat to win again and no one will do anything about it, just like these last 4 years. agent_1:Right, I figured the same thing! I don't think he's good and if he wins I think we know for sure it was rigged. agent_2:Well one problem is the election is based on the electoral college more than actual peoples votes. If we could get rid of the electoral college and get back to the popular vote, like it should be, he wouldn't even have won the first time. agent_1:For sure. They should do it like athens did back in the day. Use a lottery system to prevent oligarchy! I think he is cheating the system agent_2:Yep and nothing is being done about it. Bill Clinton cheated on his wife and every one through a fit and started impeachment proceedings, but Trump supposedly gets away with treason and it really grinds my gears. agent_1:For sure, and cheating on his wife a bunch of times! agent_2:yeah Clinton was not a good husband but he was a pretty darn good president, I will never understand why his personal life mattered to so many people, and then when it looks like we have an actual traitor in the seat no one seems to care. agent_1:for sure, people made good money and the economy was great! Good chatting with you! agent_2:Yeah same to you, good chat.	agent_1:bye!	agent_2 likes farewell. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['farewell', 'politics', 'political candidate'].
6618	agent_1:I guess a disabled student who won a case against a TX school died recently.  Her name is Amber Tatro. agent_2:Yeah,  thats sad.  Do you used facebook? agent_1:Yes, but I'm not addicted... It was a tough SC case.  I'm not sure I agree that schools should have to perform medical procedure.  They are school not a hospital.  agent_2:Yes I agree,  unless they have medical training.  agent_1:It was all kinds of things with her... Infections, injections, etc... The school would need a team.  She got a standing ovation when she graduated.  agent_2:Right.  That is pretty amazing.  agent_1:Facebook... It seems to have many uses.  Iceland is using to rewrite their constitution.  What do you use it for? agent_2:I use it for keeping in touch with people,  seeing what people are up to and news.  How about yourself? agent_1:That's the same with me.  I comment very little.  I didn't realize Facebook is blue because Zuckerburg is red-green colorblind... agent_2:Me either.  I just recently saw the movie the social network,  its about facebooks start.  agent_1:Yeah, kids from Harvard -- wasn't it a student post board?  Myspace could have bought it for penny's... agent_2:Yeah something like that.  I know right,  that was a huge mis opportunity on their part. 	agent_1:Yeah.  Why would Burger King have a promotion to encourage others to unfriend others?

9368	agent_1:Hello, do you follow politics? agent_2:Hi, it's hard not to these days with everything going on in the news. agent_1:I agree. Did you know there hasn't been a president who wasn't a republican or democrat since 1853? agent_2:Wow I did not know it has been that long. I really think Bernie should run as an independent and not as democrat. The fear is always splitting the vote, but that happens anyway. agent_1:Yep that's true. Every president with a beard has always been a republican. agent_2:Really? I guess you're right. Of course the gop used to be completely different than the mess they are today. Only recently I discovered GOP stands for grand old party... agent_1:Oh wow I didn't know it stood for that either. The last time a republican was elected president without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was back in 1928. agent_2:Crazy, although I don't think there will be a Bush in 2020. Did you know when Hillary was in college she was president of young republicans? agent_1:That's hilarious. I did not know that about her. 	agent_2:Yeah, the Republican party was a lot different more recently than people think. In fact Nixon was the only president ever to propose a guaranteed min income. Now people would probably like to reduce min wage to $2 an hour or something crazy. 	agent_1 dislikes politics. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'politics', 'no'].
1847	"agent_1:Did you know that Jazz music originated in New Orleans? agent_2:Hello - I did not know that. Do you like jazz music? agent_1:It began in the early 1900's there and became really popular in the 1920's. I like all styles of music actually.  Rock music, pop music, country, I like it all.  agent_2:That's pretty cool. Jazz trumpeters grew goatees to provide comfort while playing. agent_1:That's interesting to know!  There's different styles of jazz...Gypsy jazz and Kansas City jazz. agent_2:I didn't know they had those two different styles. That's really cool. agent_1:Yes.  Clint Eastwood is a lifelong jazz fan! agent_2:That's cool. A Harlem woman has held free jazz concerts in her apartment for 20 years now. agent_1:Neat!  I bet that is a pain to drag up the guitars and piano  up there. agent_2:I bet so too. Pakistan has a jazz orchestra. agent_1:Interesting.  I don't think of jazz when I think of Pakistan.  agent_2:Me either lol. Eddie Van Halen set his studio speakers on fire when he recorded the guitar solo for ""beat it"". agent_1:Whoa!  His playing was literally on fire.  lol  Brian May from Queen uses coins as guitar picks. agent_2:That's cool I've heard of people using coins before. agent_1:It probably would give it a different sound I would think since you're strumming the strings with a metal and not plastic pick. agent_2:I bet you're right on that. He also has a PHD in astrophysics. agent_1:Interesting.  The guitarist from Pink Floyd turned a houseboat into a recording studio.  Crazy stuff. agent_2:That's funny. A group climb Britain's highest mountain back in 2006 and found a piano on top. agent_1:I couldn't even imagine the ordeal it would have been for whomever had to take that piano up there originally.

8501	agent_1:hi how are you? do you like baseball? agent_2:Hi, I think it is fun to learn about. I don't understand why the managers can also be players. That is sort of odd. agent_1:that must date back to the day when one of the players was chosen to manage as well. like an onfield boss or leader. agent_2:Oh okay, that makes more sense for sure. The rules can be outdated sometimes, I think. I remember a story about a man who found old baseball cards in his grandpas attic. Being outdated is a good thing then. agent_1:yes, those old cards would be worth a lot to someone. i would sell some of them and keep the rest as an investment. agent_2:Yes, the man found out that they were worth 3 million dollars, in fact. agent_1:that is wonderful chunk of change! more that you could make just by chatting online with someone, i think LOL Would you sell the cards? agent_2:Yeah, I think I would too. As soon as I hired a police escort to the bank. Baseball is so popular in Japan, did you know that? agent_1:yes, i have been to games there. the fans are different, but just as enthusiastic. i recommend going. agent_2:Oh, neat what a fun experience. Yeah I learned that the fans in Japan just can't believe that Americans consider it a passtime. agent_1:yes, they are not aware of how big stuff outside of Japan is. they think that 7-11 started in Japan. strange. but now many japanese players are in the MLB> agent_2:Oh wow, what a trip. I think its neat how pro athletes give things and money to causes. For instance some NFL player leave their shoes on the field n order to bring awareness to homelessness. agent_1:yes, that is a great way to raise awareness. i wish more athletes did things like that.  agent_2:Me too, it make a real difference. I am a big fan of Target too, lol. I guess just because they price match and I like to shop. agent_1:i havent gone there much. it looks like a clean, safe walmart. i guess it is good that they price match. agent_2:Yeah, they have all sorts of thing but havent sold tobacco since 1996. agent_1:yeah, i thought that was strange. there is money in cigs, and people buy them. i guess they felt it was a bad way to make money. agent_2:Yeah, I agree to let people buy and sell what they want to we are free here, its nice. I think they sell ballet shoes there too and I know my daughter goes through 4 pairs a week as a professional ballet dancer.	agent_1:I would probably go through 10 pairs.

The only thing I know about it, is that it's a drama show. agent_1:I've watched it a few times, it's a pretty good show.I've never seen the National Geographic show called Game of lions, though.  Have you? agent_2:No, I can't say that I have. I haven't even heard of that either. What did you like about Game of Thrones? agent_1:I like fantasy type shows and this one has a large cast with several plot lines going on at the same time.  It holds your interest and is never boring. Scenery is beautiful, it gets filmed in Ireland, Canada Iceland, Malta Scotland, Spain, and the U.S. agent_2:I think the only guy I really know from the show is Peter Dinklage because he won an Emmy for being on the show. agent_1:Well. Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter plays Talis on the show, also. agent_2:That is interesting! The show comes on HBO right? I'll have to check it out sometime. agent_1:Yes, it does.  Just binge watch it, all seven seasons.  The eighth season doesn't premiere until April, so you have some time to get up to speed, it's worth watching! agent_2:Eight seasons? That means it came out in 2011. That is a long time for a show to be on and still being successful. agent_1:Yeah, that long.  It has a big following, so much so that Arya the name of one of the characters is the fastest rising baby name for girls in the U.S. agent_2:That is a little disturbing. Not sure I would name my kid from a TV show. I think the actor that played Arya was actually her first role in anything. agent_1:I know right.  I wouldn't either, but some people are very big fans. Lol agent_2:I'm not that big of a fan of anything. Lots of celebrities are overrated. In 2007 Paris Hilton was voted the most overrated celebrity. agent_1:Me either and I remember when Paris Hilton was everywhere.  I wish the Kardashians would go the same way.  They are way overrated, as well.  	agent_2:Yeah, the Kardashians are the very definition of celebrity.

Scary! agent_2:I  did, I thought that was a terrifying story as well, King Zeno, sure seems like a scary piece agent_1:That would be scary to see that guy for sure, it sounds as if he had PTSD, this was apparently a while ago but still, mental health should have been treated a lot better then! agent_2:I know right, I wonder if its based on real life events? King Zeno is one hell of a scary novel, not apt for everyone agent_1:For sure, it is about a century old but still so scary. Do you like to listen to jazz music? agent_2:I love it yeah, what about you? do you like the genre agent_1:Not a huge fan but a fan of the historic value of jazz, there's so many types of jazz like swing, Kansas City Jaz, and Gypsy jazz. What other kind of music do you like? agent_2:It has deep roots that go almost a hundred years ago, it means a lot to many people, nice tunes and melody agent_1:For sure, Clint Eastwood is a lifelong jazz fan, which is pretty surprising to be honest given his previous roles. agent_2:Really his a fan? well he has great musical taste then, I hear Pakistan has a great Jazz orchestra agent_1:I would never have guessed that. Have you ever noticed that a lot of jazz trumpeters have goatees? Apparently it is to provide comfort while they play. agent_2:Ive always wondered about those out of style goatees I guess it makes sense to grow them if its for comfort however weird they look agent_1:True, it'd be tough to be playing it for so long without anything there I am assuming.

We are running out of so many things on this earth. Did you know 80 percent of forests have been destroyed? agent_2:thats a sad thing to hear. but we still have a bunch, so imagine how many we used to have! agent_1:I couldn't imagine! I wonder if that's why some birds fly from Alaska to Mexico without sleeping? agent_2:they have to get to the warm, and fast! they must get tired making the long journey tho agent_1:I'm sure they sleep for days haha. Birds are pretty smart. There are wilds birds in Australia that can mimic the sound of cameras, car alarms, and chainsaws. agent_2:That's so funny. I wonder what their accents are like. Because birds have accents! agent_1:I'm picturing british and american birds talking to each other lol. I would like to see that, but also hang out with cats in Taiwan. agent_2:id love to hear a bird with a cockneyed British accent. do you like cats? agent_1:No I actually don't really like cats lol, but you can hang out with them at a cafe in Taiwan. I think that would be interesting. agent_2:that would be interesting, but i would avoid it, im allergic! agent_1:Wise person you are! Have you seen the godfather? I guess the cat in the opening scene was a stray they found on set! agent_2:i actually havent but id love to. i wonder if they paid that cat SAG day rates agent_1:haha or in cat treats? I envy the life of a cat, it spends most of its life sleeping lol. agent_2:that would be fun, so much better than working all day long agent_1:I agree! Would you ever want a cat as your town mayor? agent_2:haha it would about as useful as my current mayor....what town elected a cat???	agent_1:It was Talkeetna, Alaska!

Dogs are not colour blind, but cannot see as many different colours as humans agent_1:That's interesting. Google's code of conduct mentions that they are a dog company! agent_2:Haha, yeah.  Me too! agent_1:Dogs and elephants are the only animals that seem to instinctively understand pointing. agent_2:That's neat.

I was wondering how it was. agent_2:No, I didn't. It sounds like it could have been good Ewan McGregor is a pretty good actor.  agent_1:Yes, he is.  I didn't go see it, because I thought people would look at me strange seeing a ""kids"" movie.  But I always liked Winnie the Pooh, as a child. agent_2:It was a good show. Did you know Christopher Robin was a real boy?  agent_1:I heard that he was the author's son in real life.

They are always up to something.  agent_1:Did you know that Pixar studios has a secret room for only celebrities? agent_2:No I did not know that until I read these articles. The favors celebrities get bothers me.  agent_1:Yeah seriously,  kinda ridiculous.  Also,  how much they get paid,  I feel like actors and actresses dont even do the hardest work,  all the editing and music and stuff seems like way more work lol agent_2:I agree, Kim Kardashian earned $53 million in 2015, Judge Judy earns $123,000 per tv episode!! just mind blowing. There are people out there going to bed without food.  agent_1:I really dislike that whole Kardashian family. I think  it is ridiculous how much money they make and they dont really seem to earn it.  I think I saw one episode where the younger one wants to buy a house and doesn't even know what credit is.  agent_2:lol, they are socialites and the media has elevated them. Just revealing their 3 rd child's name - Chicago blew up social media. 	agent_1:Yeah it's crazy,  and all their businesses are completely run by other people.

That makes a lot sense. I use mine to hide my shame. agent_1:Haha me as well shame is well hidden in shirts. agent_2:I would have fit in well during the chinese cultural revolution. They layered! agent_1:Yes they had some quite interesting clothing.  It is very generic all over the world nowadays. agent_2:I had no idea the difference between a button down and a button up. Who knew! agent_1:Me neither it is insane how much we do not know. agent_2:I do not know a lot more than most people. I just shake my head and smile.

Especially after a 108 year drought! agent_1:Totally! They were the first team to ever win back-to-back World Series, then nothing. agent_2:Yes I do love Wrigley field where they play - its within the city agent_1:Did you know they evidently didn't win for so long because they were ""cursed"" by a man named Billy because Wrigley Field security would let him stay there with his pet goat? agent_2:Yes - who takes a goat to a baseball game?  But 5 million people celebrated in the streets after they finally won! agent_1:I would have, too! For one of the oldest teams in the major league? What a day. agent_2:Yes.

Facebook is developing AI designed to better understand emotions, identify objects, and predict user actions. Yikes.  agent_1:Clifford seems to be a great way to augment teaching. I would like to see a pre and post test with a control group to see how well the AI works. agent_2:Interesting. At Stanford they use Google Hangouts to teach AI more effectively.  agent_1:That's interesting. I teach college courses and would love to see how that works. I wonder if the non-for-profit has more info on it. agent_2:Good question. How about this one -- there's a NASA scientist who believes our world is just a computer generated VR. Maybe he's been watching too much of The Matrix.  agent_1:That's nuts. I sometimes wonder if the ultra-intelligent need things to maintain their sanity...	agent_2:Haha. Definitely.

For instance, there is a poem where if you read it one way it's sad, but read it in reverse and it's actually inspirational! agent_1:Wow, I bet that poem required a lot creativity, wrtting a poem with completely different meanings, oposing genres, genius agent_2:There is one guy that wrote a poem of over 220 words in palindrome (where it is the same backwards and forwards -- like ""nurses run"")! agent_1:Sounds really hard, did you ever read one of Edgar Allan Poe's poems? agent_2:I think I read a couple.  I feel like I know them so well because of horror and Halloween stories.  I know ""The Raven"" was pretty popular.  Do you think he made a lot of money with that poem? agent_1:Not really in fact he only made $9 for the publication of that poem, seems really underpaid agent_2:Wow!  That is crazy!  I hope he had a good day job.  Maybe just regular fiction works would have been better financially. agent_1:I hope he did as well, the raven is like his most popular poem and selling it for $9, business was slow, he also wrote cyborg fiction, agent_2:That's pretty cool.  If he'd had a black character in it in the 1950s that was worthy of banning a science fiction comic! agent_1:That sounds really racist, theres a wiki rank of fictional characters according to power and abilities,  I wonder who is the strongest hero agent_2:Maybe like a Superman type or Hercules?  Funny thing, future emperor Julius Caesar actually wrote Hercules based fan fiction when he was younger.

The Nationals recently traded Daniel Murphy and Matt Adams to the Cubs agent_2:I don't follow baseball much, but I do think I heard something recently in the news about how the Cubs won over the Phillies? It's so confusing when they trade players for me to follow! agent_1:Yea, I guess the manager Martinez isn't doing too good in Washington and traded them away agent_2:I think the Cubs have been having a lot of trouble with their player's health. I hope they can turn it around and have a good season! agent_1:Maybe, but the Cubs haven't been too lucky since they started in 1903 agent_2:I think I've heard about that...are they the team that one back to back and then haven't won another World Series since then? agent_1:The Cubs didn't win until 2016, they beat the Royals I believe  agent_2:Oops meant won not one.

It was a couple who did it for 24 years in a row agent_1:Wow, the must really love baseball!  That is a lot of time dedicated to the sport,  that is really sweet that they had something they were both passionate about though.  agent_2:Exactly because scheduling 2430 games every year is no easy feat agent_1:I know right!  Probably after a few years they developed a working system or a program. agent_2:Yeah that is a high possibility too. Do you know when the World Series was founded? agent_1:No I dont.  When? agent_2:It was founded in 1903 and at that time even the ottoman empire was in existence still agent_1:Interesting.  did you know the chicago cubs were the first team to win back to back world series?	agent_2:Yes they were but then they were cursed or something because they have not won anymore since then	agent_1 dislikes sports. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'video games', 'no'].

I guess they started that in 2018, it sounds like a lot of people on Twitter were upset too agent_1:About Pride Month or something else? agent_2:I think they were mad that one of the rapper's was supporting president Trump, and they were very happy to hear that Disney was making the LGBT ears or something like that, I don't pay attention to Twitter so I'm not a hundred percent sure agent_1:Got it. Yeah, the rapper is Kanye West. Another singer, John Legend, asked West to ""reconsider"" agent_2:Speaking of Disney, what are you like about their movies?

Back to Kanye West though, what do you think about him giving a mic to one of his fans in a wheelchair at a concert? That was nice of him agent_1:Agree, but calling Trump a ""brother"" went too far. Trump is no bro! Kanye is big music celeb, though. agent_2:Yeah, he's definitely an interesting guy, his ideas are not always good though, for instance he thinks that aids is a man-made disease agent_1:Heard that. Since when did people create viruses like HIV? West has made a lot of big $$$ producing records, fwith influences from soul, to electro to gospel. agent_2:Yes that's a really crazy thing. Kind of like when he mocked himself on SNL for interrupting someone at an awards show, and then did it in real life to Taylor Swift, definitely the guy has some issues agent_1:Think so. His main genre, Rap, is huge, though. Has lots of components, like what is said, rhythm or flow, and tone. Are you a fan of Rap? agent_2:Yes I do like rap. I mostly like Tupac Shakur stuff, apparently some of his music is in the Library of Congress actually agent_1:'bout time. Some folks say Rap/hip-hop definitely has West African roots - and is based on religious worship. "	agent_2:Yeah I can see that.

That doesn't sound true, but I wonder if it is the same for the iphone? agent_2:I don't know what you mean?

I was wondering how toys came out so quickly to promote a movie.  agent_2:I also think about it. agent_1:Also, apparently in the 70's Disney recycled a lot of animation frames so there are identical scenes in some movies.

Teslas are supposedly so safe they broke the safety testing equipment agent_1:that is cool and also model s is tested indoors becuase it does not produce emissions agent_2:I didnt know that it was because it got tested indoors, but given how they run that does make sense. agent_1:yeah. did you know elon also founded paypal? agent_2:No.  Ive read his biography, but didn't remember that one.  He is a fascinating person.  If people complained about their wages, he would often try to do their job, and if he deemed that he could do it, or it could otherwise be absorbed, he would fire them.	agent_1:Wow, he can be eccentric sometimes.

Apparently the Yankees trade with the Reds for Chapman before the 2016 season when Chapman was set to serve a suspension for a domestic abuse incident is similar agent_1:Yea, I remember that, although Chapman is a great closer I wish the Yankees wouldn't of traded for him in 2016 due to his incidents	agent_2:It seems risky.

That's the focus people in Silicon Valley are taking. agent_1:I agree.  Facebook is developing an AI desinged to understand user emotions, identify objects in photos, and predict users actions. agent_2:I admire John Doerr for writing a book about how to make people work together more productively. agent_1:I'm going to have to look that book up.  I'm not familiar with him or the book.  Speaking of books, I didn't know Kristen Stewart co-authored a paper about AI. agent_2:Yeah, you should read the book.

9160	agent_1:Are you a fan of Star Wars? agent_2:Yea, I love the original 1977 Start Wars agent_1:Me too!  All of the movies combined have made over $8.5 billion at the box office! agent_2:That is impressive, I guess that's why Star Wars was named the most successful film merchandising franchise by Guinness World Records agent_1:Oh yea...The entire franchise is estimated to be valued at $65 billion! agent_2:That is impressive, I'm surprised that Star Wars is only the fifth highest-grossing media franchise agent_1:Yes!  I agree.  Marcia Lucas, the wife of George Lucas, won an academy award for editing the first movie. agent_2:Nice, Marcia Lucas had such a huge impact on Star Wars and made the film better agent_1:I agree.  What's funny is that she won that award and George didn't win one for directing! agent_2:Yea but he did get to keep the licensing and merchandising rights from fox so he made out pretty good agent_1:Oh yes...smart move on his part! agent_2:Yea, 20th century fox really messed up and should of just paid George the 500k directing fee agent_1:Yes lol.

10575	"agent_1:lol, On april 18, 1930, the bbc decided there was no news worth reporting, so they broadcast piano music instead. Did You hear about that ? agent_2:No I didn't ...I'd bet it was more soothing that  the news agent_1:what do You mean, You don't like regular news ? ;) agent_2:Absolutely not. News is often depressing, and I could stand without it. Now, toss on a piano song, or music....now you've got me. Though I hate classical music. Well, most of it. agent_1:I wander if Brits were surprised when instead of news they got piano music instead ;) lol agent_2:They may have thought they won the lottery. I'm an older dude, but give me a nice pounding Elton John or Billy Joel rocker on piano, and I'm rockin' away! agent_1:Hey I'm with You, I mean I'm only 37 but yeah... I'll take ""Piano man"" instead of news any day ;) agent_2:It makes me happy when a younger guy like yourself, I'm 61, still could listen to a good piano song. Didn't realize people your age still know what musical instruments are? Well, not that you're that young. agent_1:hey ! :) I'm young inside ;) but yeah... I listen to all kind of rock, blues and metal... Pink Floyd, Joe Bonamassa, Dire Straits, Metallica, Nirvana... and many more ;) agent_2:Nice! I used to be a DJ in clubs back in the day....remembered playing a ton of that stuff. Been to a lot of concerts? agent_1:Oh yes, I think I've beat my record last year... I saw Nick Cave twice, I won tickets to see Metallica, and I saw King Crimson for the first time. Oh, and I saw Joe Bonamassa too ;) agent_2:You got to see some good ones, that's for sure. I stopped going to concerts years ago!, but man....back in the 70's, seeing Pink Floyd, Bachman Turner Overdrive, Heart and Electric Light Orchestra on the same bill was fantastic....and it was only $15.00 a ticket. agent_1:Holy Crap ! ;) Now to see phil collins it's like $350 and those are not even good seats... ;) times changed, that's for sure... agent_2:Yep. I wish the Factual Section 3 was Rock Music instead of Classical. The only story I have on classical music, is that I was a limo driver for an Arab shiek back in 2001. He bought me a 10 disco best of Classical artists box sex. Wasn't bad, but only listened to it once or twice.

I heard that the piano is an acoustic instrument. agent_1:Oh really? I never knew that! I guess the strings are struck by hammers huh? agent_2:I guess so. Do you know who invented the piano? agent_1:Wasn't in by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700 in Italy? agent_2:That is correct. The piano is being playing using a keyboard that has a row of keys that the pianist presses down to cause the hammers to strike the strings. agent_1:That is one interesting fact! You know what is more interesting though, how computers have come about! agent_2:I agree. Computers are more complex than pianos in my opinion because they are devices that carry sequences by computer programming. agent_1:Well said! I wish I could have used a computer that used water to run it like the Russians did! agent_2:Really!! I didn't know that the Russians did this. Do you know who wrote the first computer algorithm? agent_1:No I don't! Who was it? agent_2:It was by a woman named Ada Lovelace. agent_1:Oh cool! I wonder if she wanted to upload her mind to a computer like other transhumanists want to! agent_2:Wouldn't that be cool Ha!!! Do you know by any chance what was the number one installed piece of software on computers in 1995? agent_1:Was it something like Solitaire?	agent_2:No. It was the video game Doom which I came across this fact very recently.	agent_1 likes video games. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['video games', 'music', 'instruments'].

I think it's cool that Pixar studio has a secret room that is often visited by celebrities. agent_1:Yeah for sure! I just heard about that room a few days ago. Speaking of Disney, do you like the movie Aladdin? agent_2:Yeah Aladdin is one of my favorites and I am looking forward to the remake. I really enjoyed Robin Williams in the original. agent_1:Me too. I miss him making films. I guess he started the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films. What a legend. agent_2:Very much a legend. Rest in peace Robin. Celebrities make so much money. For example judge Judy makes $123,000 per episode. agent_1:That's crazy! I don't even watch Judge Judy. Celebs make too much, I think.	agent_2:Yeah I think we should put our priorities in different things not just celebrities.

8085	agent_1:hello there  agent_2:Hello yourself> What have you been getting up to tonight? agent_1:Just relaxing, hanging with my dog.  Listening to music. Yourself?  agent_2:Similar regarding the dog. I was talking to my roommate about MLS Soccer.  agent_1:I like Orlando City, personally. I have a good friend who used to play for Manchester United.  agent_2:Really? I bet that was wild.  I didn't think I'd ever need to know much about it myself. We were actually talking about Wayne Rooney a little bit ago.  agent_1:Do you have any thoughts about where Wayne Rooney will end up next year?  agent_2:No thoughts but I've heard talk. Atlanta has gone nuts for MLS the last couple of years. We won the Cup this year and now when you walk into a bar you hear guys speculating about Rooney to DC United next year.   agent_1:Orlando has embraced MLS too, I am quite surprised how popular it has become.   agent_2:I'm with you 110% on that. I haven't heard anyone talk about how embarrassing the Falcons are in weeks.  It makes sense. We haven't ever really had a winner before. I'm wondering if Rooney can still play or if this is like Beckham playing in LA when the MLS began.  agent_1:To switch gears for a moment, I'm listening to Dizzy Gillespie at the moment.  He always was a favorite of mine, a trumpet virtuoso. Did you now that jazz trumpeters often grow goatees because it provides comfort when they play their instrument?  agent_2:I didn't but I can see why that would be appealing.The facial hair I mean. I've tried to like it but Jazz just doesn't do much for me.  New Orleans jazz is sort of the exception. I like the big brass sections. I do like zydeco and that has a lot of jazz influence.   agent_1:I definitely would say I prefer music that's influenced by jazz, rather than jazz itself. Tom Waits is my favorite artist ever, and the influence of jazz is present on a lot of his work.  	agent_2:I agree with you about the influence it's had on other music. It's kind of funny that you brought up jazz actually.  It's such a mish mash of musical influences from around the world but it's probably still the most original art form that the United States has ever produced.  That's sort of what we've got going on with the Atlanta FC here.  	agent_1 likes sports. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'MLS', 'sports'].

Who's your favorite team? agent_1:I'm a Yankees fan, I never knew Babe Ruth was caught stealing home in the 1926 World Serires agent_2:It's surprising, you don't hear many bad things about Babe Ruth. I like the Dodgers therefore I am anti-yankee. agent_1:They had a great rivalry when both were in NY. It's crazy Babe Ruth would ever try to steal a base considering how big he was agent_2:I wonder how many stolen bases he had in his career. Maybe he thought he could just run the catcher over. agent_1:That would be an interesting fact to know. It's pretty crazy the Ottoman Empire was still around when the Cubs won back to back World Series agent_2:Yes the Cubs have suffered from the curse of the goat. agent_1:Who knew a man with a goat could wield such great power agent_2:Remind me not to make an enemy of anyone carrying a goat. I wonder if that's where the saying being a goat came from. Like Ruth was the goat after losing that game. agent_1:I don'tknow, maybe, Billy Sianis goat did stink agent_2:Probably so. Did you know the Cubs and Braves started playing the same year as the battle of the little bighorn? agent_1:That is pretty crazy, I wonder if any of the people from the Battle of Little Bighorn ever saw a Cubs game agent_2:I don't know. How do you feel about people today complaining about teams that are named after Native Americans, like the Braves? agent_1:Depends on how respectful it's done, the Braves don't have a bad logo but the Indians logo is pretty messed up agent_2:The native americans don't seem to have a problem with it. It's just other people, strange.	agent_1:I wonder if there are any baseball controversies in Japan, baseball is really popular there	agent_2 likes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'baseball', 'Babe Ruth'].

I think hummingbirds are amazing.  They steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nest agent_1:haha that is funny, I do like birds, I think it would be scary to be in Austrailia and birds there can mimic different sounds, like you're walking along and think someone is chasing you with a chainsaw, but it's just a bird making that sound haha agent_2:wow that would be scary!  I saw that the famously discint do do bird is actually a sub-family of pigeon  agent_1:that is wild, I know people hunted the dodo because they were eating them, so I guess if we want to know what they tasted like we could try pigeon haha agent_2:this is interesting.  In most birds the bones are so hollow that their entire skeleton weighs less than their feathers agent_1:that is wild, I think it's crazy that there are birds that fly the distance of Alaska to Mexico without sleeping, thats a lot of endurance! agent_2:I saw that human activity threatens about 1200 bird species with extinction agent_1:ya that is sad, we are using up earth's resources, and I know that by the end of the 21st century we will have run out of helium which is very important for manufacturing agent_2:Wow that is crazy.  more than 80 percent of the earths natural forest have already been destroyed agent_1:ya that is sad, what's really crazy is how quickly this is happening, so far humans would only represent about a minute if you consider the entire history of earth to be 24 hours long agent_2:Ok so this is totally of subject but the united nations appointedd official ambassadors to extraterrestrials agent_1:haha I wonder how they appointed that guy, like he essentially knows that he will never have to work, like what does that guy do all day? I want his job haha agent_2:Exactly that is so funny!  Did you that over 7.6 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival	agent_1:I didn't that's a ton of people, I wonder if an alien would be overwhelmed at the number of people on earth, like they would have to wonder how big of a planet this is and how it supports so much life	agent_2 dislikes alien. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['alien', 'pets', 'politics'].

Look at Jupiter's moon Ganymede.  If it orbited the sun it would be a planet by definition. agent_2:Yeah and there is also a planet that orbits 4 stars, that's crazy. agent_1:I wonder how that works. I guess the stars are close together?  	agent_2:Maybe, but they would have to be far enough apart so they are not affected by each others gravity fields yet be able to influence the planet that is orbiting them.	agent_1 likes astronomy. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['astronomy', 'planet', 'no'].

I could read a book that was more about the Earth as a whole. The cosmos are fascinating. agent_1:I agree, the cosmos is fascinating and earth is too, so many planets out there, all the wonders they hold agent_2:I like to think about everything we don't know. Like astronomers possibly detecting building blocks for life in a planetary system 455 light-years away. agent_1:I think thats a real possibility and waht about that planet that has glass precipitation, hostile planet agent_2:It's so mysterious. And everything we see when we look is how what we are seeing was millions of years ago. It just takes the info that long to get to us. Who know what they are like now. agent_1:Yeah, maybe a lot more different, we wont be alive to find that out though,  agent_2:Nope. I'm kind of hoping we develop AI further soon and maybe that expedites how we are able to see and travel through the universe agent_1:I hope that too, AI can be the sollution to many problems agent_2:AI is really an interesting topic that should discussed more in politics. It's going to open up so many possibilities, but it will also lead to a large loss of employment and could even be dangerous. agent_1:It can, it can surely affect the economy, dangerous in many ways,  agent_2:Just throwing some ideas out there - we may either have to come with a universal basic income. Or the AI will just get rid of a bunch of us lol agent_1:Yeah like in the movies, AI can beat our brains they even crushed all human records on a game called the puzle game 2048	agent_2:Yeah, Chess and Go as well.

Humans only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds if the entire earths history was viewed as 1 day! agent_1:Wow that is hard to believe. And back when the earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long. agent_2:That is wild! Over 80% of Earths natural forests have been destroyed! agent_1:That is quite sad. Only 20% remaining, well I hope we can conserve that at least. agent_2:Hopefully! Do you think extraterrestrials will ever make contact with us? agent_1:I don't know that is a good question I think at some point but I don't know if it will be in my lifetime. There is definitely a lot of sightings in the literature but no specific evidence. The FDA once burned 6 tons of literature in an active US censorship.	agent_2:That is absurd!

Did you know there is a variation of soccer with 3 teams agent_2:Wow that would be interesting to watch. Do they need three goals then? agent_1:I am curious too. Do you know where the World Cup will take place in 2022? agent_2:I know that it is going to be in Qatar but I do not think they have the city ready for it yet agent_1:Yeah that is strange indeed.

But the women's team is doing pretty well agent_1:Yes they have never placed below 3rd. so good for them agent_2:Yeah they sure are good.

I probably would not use it myself because I would just vote for someone that I liked.

I know he had some struggles with wrist injuries and had to have a lot of surgeries.  To reach the pinnacle of the game after that is incredible! agent_2:Its been hard, 4 surgeries can really make you quite, but I guess it paid off and with hard work he was able to make it, Rafael Nadal also had a new injury agent_1:Nadal is a great player too.  Crazy to think that 56% of grand slam titles have gone to him, Djokovic, or Federer since 2000. agent_2:Really talented players, legends of the game, Federer is the first person in Switzerland to be honored with a official stamp agent_1:That is great.  He has held the #1 spot in the ATP rankings for 310 weeks!  That is Tiger Woods type stuff! agent_2:Yeah definitely, a low point in his career was 2016, he suffered a big injury then agent_1:Yes, while bathing his daughters of all things.  Crazy! agent_2:Really? I thought it was during a match, tough way of getting injured agent_1:Yea, no kidding.  Tennis players are usually in such good shape too.  The longest match ever went on for 11 hours over the course of 3 days! agent_2:11 hours and 3 days wow!! both players could get injured in the way agent_1:Yea, you would think that is borderline dangerous! agent_2:That shouldnt be allowed anyways, do you know the tennis player Gael Memphis?	agent_1:I have heard a story of him beating the best paddle player in the world after just learning how to play.

9324	agent_1:Hi, how are you today? These are 3 interesting articles, don't you think? agent_2:I can't believe is has been over 150 since we had a president who wasn't a Democrat or Republican agent_1:I suppose if you want to look at the original strict definitions of what Democrats or Republican party platforms were.  agent_2:DId you know that every US president with a beard has been a Republlican? agent_1:I thought that little fact was amusing but I guess manlyness sell to voters. It just shows that politicians are sensitive to what they perceive are optics. agent_2:Do you know when the last a Republican was elected president without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was? agent_1:I think the last itme was the pair HErbet Hoover & CHarles CUrtis, 1928 agent_2:I believe you are correct.  How interested are you by politics? agent_1:I am very interested as the choices I make as a voter will directly decide how I represented, good or bad.  agent_2:Are you sadden by the fact that voter participation hasn't been over 63% in presidential election in the last 100 years?	agent_1:I am as there places in the world where people do not have open and free elections.

He was a civil rights lawyer and died recently agent_1:yes, pancreatic cancer. he did a lot of work with desegregation.  agent_2:Yes he sounds like a great guy, also he lived until he was 77, which is a good life I think agent_1:i loved that he was a lawyer for planned parenthood and unions too. agent_2:He also helped a lot of people, for instance he created guidelines about lobbying and what each other's about election Law and Order to do the best job for advocating for the different causes agent_1:yep. and he did so much worked with Mississippi Center for Justice. they do so much work opposing racial and economic injustices.   agent_2:Back to John McCain no, did you know that he voted against a Federal holiday for Martin Luther King agent_1:I did. he had some problematic votes and opinions while he was serving as a senator.  i think he is also one of the few senators to cameo in a movie.  agent_2:Yes you're right he made a cameo in that movie""Wedding Crashers"" I always thought that movie was pretty funny agent_1:i wonder how many people voted the ""none of these candidates"" option when he ran on the nevada ticket.  agent_2:Yeah I wondered about that too.

6544	"agent_1:Hi!  Are you a facebook user? agent_2:Yes, I do use it, but mostly for the games app's social part. I'd rather play a game. I've heard the Virtual Reality video games are pretty cool. Would you try? agent_1:I think I would try it to see what it was like. agent_2:I've seen lots of examples on Facebook of people playing a VR game and getting terrified or surprised. It looks like a lot of fun! agent_1:I wonder how much the headsets cost for it?  The fist virtual reality game was made in 1968.  I had no idea they were around then. agent_2:I thought I've heard that VR has been used for training soldiers, so I wonder if it could have been around for even longer than 1968, but kept secret! agent_1:Quite possible.  I read where 40 percent of users experience motion sickness in virtual reality. agent_2:Well, that part doesn't sound very fun. Did you know there is a NASA scientist who genuinely believes we're living in a reality generated by a computer? Or maybe multiple computers... agent_1:I didn't know that.  I know that Lockheed Martin has a virtual reality ""Mars bus"" that can take kids on a tour of Mars.  That would be neat. agent_2:Wow, I was excited when I heard a company was starting art buses to park in lots of shopping centers to look after kids while parents shop. I can't even imagine how great a VR Mars tour bus would be!!! agent_1:Hahaha  Do you know anyone that has the Oculus Rift VR headset that Facebook released? agent_2:I don't, but I'd love to try it. I am really interested in those augmented reality systems that area a type of VR. I had an idea for those Google glasses before they came out, even! agent_1:Nice!  Stanford's free artificial intelligence class uses Google plus hangouts to help them teach more effectively.  What do you think of AI?  It kind of scares me. lol agent_2:Meant to say augmented reality. I think it's strange how Tesler's Theorem for AI is whatever hasn't been done yet. Does that mean he wouldn't call the VR games AI? agent_1:I have no idea.  Good question.  AI has crushed all human records in the puzzle game ""2048"".  I haven't heard of that game. agent_2:I haven't heard of that game, either. There's a game I play where you get better by doing daily tasks. I should make an AI device to do it for me! agent_1:lol Nice!  Did you hear about the promotion that Burger King ran where if you were to unfriend 10 people on Facebook they would give you a free whopper?  I would have taken them up on that. agent_2:I think there were probably people catching on and adding 10 random people just to unfriend, though! Can you believe that in a part of Germany the Facebook like button is illegal? agent_1:I wonder why?  I'm going to have to look that up.  I wonder what Myspace thinks of passing up on the chance to buy Facebook for $75 million in 2005?  Is Myspace even still around? agent_2:I think MySpace is around but everyone uses Facebook instead. I think Facebook is worth hundreds of billions today. "	agent_1:In 2012 when they had their IPO they were valued at $104 billion then.  So you are right. I'm sure it's more than that now.

4830	"agent_1:Do you like fish? agent_2:Yes, I love fish (at least eating it). I find it funny that freshwater fish only ""drink"" water through their skin via osmosis, while saltwater fish also drink water through their mouths. agent_1:I like to eat them too, and that is funny, have you heard of the black swallower fish before? agent_2:Well, I've heard that they can eat prey twice their length and ten times their weight, so they must be quite strong.  agent_1:I agree and also a scary species, they seem like quite the predator agent_2:Yeah, for sure! I also found it interesting that a seahorse is the only fish to have a neck. I didn't even know it was a kind of fish. agent_1:The only one? reallly? that is suprising I though most fish had a neck agent_2:Actually, I think what we take for a fish's neck (I've made this mistake also) is not really a neck, but more the area where their gills come out. I find it interesting also that 84 per cent of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish. agent_1:Sounds like a fish we have to study a lot more closely, they can be the solution to many of our health problems and the immortal jellyfish agent_2:Yeah, for sure! It's kind of funny actually, because they said that in humans, that if a human has a rib surgically shortened, that he/she can regrow a rib equally as strong as the original within only 2-3 months. agent_1:Humans are just amazing, we adapt for persistnace and we are the best distance runners in all the animal kingdom agent_2:Yeah, for sure! Humans do have their downfalls though, because they cannot synthesize their own vitamin c like animals and plants can. agent_1:I guess its a great thing we know how to appy science, "	agent_2:Yeah, for sure! One thing that humans have going for them however is their creativity.

Is there anything in particular he is stubborn on?  agent_1:He is a great kid, until he plays Fortnite. Something about that game gets him all jacked up and he acts like a different kid.	agent_2:There have been a lot of studies on video games and it's effect on children.

11188	"agent_1:Hi, how are you? What do you know about the White House? agent_2:I know that there are identical versions of it in Ireland and France agent_1:That makes sense. The US has had close relationships with those countries for years. agent_2:Their versions probably don't still use floppy disks for storing like ours does partially agent_1:I wonder if that is for security purposes. Strangely outdated tech. Hm. agent_2:That was my guess too. I find it interesting how many times the White House has undergone renovations. The West Wing wasn't created until 1901, and it was expanded only eight years after that agent_1:It was a modest residence. The guest house is bigger, I hear. I wonder when that was built. agent_2:Who knows? I'm surprised Trump hasn't made any changes to the White House. Solar panels were put on the back by George W. Bush, and I've heard that's not the first time they've attempted solar power agent_1:Carter put them on first. Oil shock and that. Reagan removed them. Clinton did nothing. agent_2:At least none of them banned Christmas trees like Teddy Roosevelt did agent_1:Teddy was a conservationist. He did like destroying nature. Unless they were animals with heads for trophies. agent_2:Think he made clothing from fur? I wouldn't be surprised if he did agent_1:He probably did. I guess he thought he was being manly by killing wild animals. Seems senseless. There are other ways to prove your toughness. agent_2:True, though I'm sure it was good insulation in the winter agent_1:Yes, that's true. He was an interesting guy. Larger than life. agent_2:I wonder if he would have had an iPhone if he lived in this decade. Women are more likely to own them than men, but maybe he would have preferred Apple agent_1:I think he would have hated technology like that. He was an outdoorsman.  agent_2:He might have tried the game ""Send me to heaven"" by throwing his into the air. He wouldn't have minded a shattered phone if he won agent_1:LOL. Probably not. Anyway, thanks for the chat! agent_2:He definitely wouldn't have bought anything from Apple's clothing line. Yes, good chat! agent_1:True. Apple clothing? LOL"	agent_2:It was a thing back in the 80s.

Well I think the Yankees will have a better season.  agent_1:Yes, they seem good.  I also was happy to see the Brewers finally rising to the challenge. agent_2:Hey now your talking, the Brewers are my favorite team.  I was upset when they lost game 7 to the dodgers.  agent_1:I used to live in Wisconsin so still happy when they win.  LA team looks pretty good too. agent_2:Nice! Yeah LA has been really good the last few seasons, I think they will have another good one next year.  agent_1:Do you think next year will favor slugging hitters again? agent_2:I think it will.  I think there will be even more home runs next year, how about you? agent_1:I think so as well.  agent_2:Did you watch much of the world series this year? agent_1:No, I missed it, I work odd hours. agent_2:Yeah after the Brewers lost I didn't have too much interest.  agent_1:Wow, I just read that in 1973 two yankees pitchers swapped families permanently, is that crazy or what? agent_2:That is wild!  I know Babe Ruth was a famous Yankee, did you ever see the movie the pride of the yankees? agent_1:I have not, to be honest I'm not a sports fan.  agent_2:I watched it recently it was pretty good, Babe Ruth played himself in the movie, a good Yankee movie.  agent_1:That is interesting!  Did you see they suspended Don Mattingly because he refused to get a haircut?  I can't imagine that happening these days. agent_2:Yeah, I remember the Simpsons doing a parody of that one time as well.  agent_1:Now you're talking!  Love the Simpsons! agent_2:Oh yeah, the softball episode is my favorite of all time, Daryl Strawberry was in it, he was a former Yankee right?	agent_1:Do you remember which season?

I recently saw Bill Burr and he was very funny. agent_2:That's cool.  I like comedy movies and tv shows.  Have you ever seen 3rd rock from the sun? agent_1:I have watched a few episodes but I didn't follow it closely? How about you? agent_2:I've seen a few. I heard it beat out Seinfeld, Friends, and even Frasier for the best comedy award in 1997. agent_1:That was a lot of great shows nominated at once. I watch a lot of Brooklyn Nine Nine now, I think that's one of the best shows on TV. agent_2:I've never seen it but I have seen the commercials and it looks funny.  You are right about all those great shows.  Sounds like there was a lot of good comedy back in 1997. agent_1:It's definitely not the same these days as it was back then. I think the rise of cable prices has hurt how many people are watching TV. agent_2:Speaking of cable tv. What do you think of comedy central? agent_1:I like Comedy Central, I haven't watched it as much lately because I have been watching Netflix and Amazon Prime more. agent_2:Comedy Central may be very particular on how they do comedy.  I've heard they've canceled over 100 shows since they started back in 1989.	agent_1:That's a lot of shows to cancel.

Tennis is fun too. a black man won the us open in 1968 and no other black man has since then. That would be award worthy agent_2:Yes they should make a movie about him! it's interesting to that until 1978 you could use any object as a tennis racket, that sounds dangerous agent_1:That would be hilarious to see what some  people came up with.

Are you? agent_1:I think it's fun to read sometimes. The origins are more interesting for me. Early poems in the Eurasian content evolved from folksongs.  agent_2:I dont much about poetry. that is interesting. i guess poetry and songs would be closely related. agent_1:Yes I suppose they would. They tried to define poetry in ancient Greece such as Aristotle's poetics. It focused on the use of speech in rhetoric, drama, song, and comedy. agent_2:I guess poetry is spoken and written, so it is related to many arts. Do you have a favorite poet? agent_1:I think it's funny when comedians do poetry. I don't really have a favorite poet.

Did you know that a married couple scheduled all 2430 games for 24 years until 2005? agent_1:Wow, that is pretty cool.  And no I didn't know that but that is very interesting.  I wonder how they ever got that job? agent_2:I don't know, but it must be complicated since there are sometimes concerts and other uses of stadiums.  Also, it's too cold in some ballparks early in the season.  There is a form of baseball played with a kickball in Canada. agent_1:Yeah that is true, the weather is unpredictable and some stadiums don't have roofs.  Yeah I think it is called soccer-baseball or something like that.  agent_2:It is odd that managers wear baseball uniforms.  Coaches in other sports don't wear uniforms. agent_1:Yeah it is odd, but do you know why they might wear uniforms unlike other sports? agent_2:I have read that they can actually enter the game but I am not sure that I believe it.   agent_1:Yeah that is right, technically they can play if they need to.  Wouldn't that be fun to watch your team's manager play and bat.  agent_2:Some would do well because they were recently players, but sometimes they are over 60 years old.  Some of Japan's baseball fans are surprised that it is such a big deal in the US. agent_1:Yeah I know Japanese people are really into baseball.  Did you watch the world series this year? agent_2:Yes.  The American League champ plays the National League champ and the NL is not doing so well lately. agent_1:Yeah my team was one game away from representing the NL in the series.

9438	agent_1:Hi. Do you like comedy?  I didn't know until recently that comedy originated in ancient greece. agent_2:ya I do like comedy, I like that Drew Carey got his start doing comedy when he was in the marines agent_1:I didn't know that. I had no idea he was in the marines!  The greek that comedy was two groups against one another in an amusing conflict. agent_2:yup, comedy is cool it was founded in ancient Greece which I didnt know agent_1:It's got to be hard to do too.  I mean, comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows since 1989. agent_2:that is crazy, its funny too the first comedy film was a guy slipping on a banana peel to fall into horse poop haha agent_1:It is funny.  I'm guessing it was an old film and even still today that would be funny!  Hey,did you know that ancient greece did political satire and it influenced their voters?  Sounds a lot like today's world. agent_2:that does sound like today, I like parody best though, it subverts your expectations and critiques without condemning agent_1:I like that too.  It seems nicer.  Everyone has their favorite though.  Bill Murray thinks kung fu hustle is the supreme achievement of modern age comedy. agent_2:haha I do like that movie, have you seen Evan Almighty? agent_1:I think I have. Is that the one with Jim Carrey?   agent_2:that was Bruce Almighty, this one was actually the most expensive comedy ever made agent_1:Are you serious?  There are so many others out there I would think would be just as expensive if not more.  I wonder if it did any good.  Trojan Wars had a budget of $15,000,000 and only earned $309. agent_2:haha weird, also weird its been 40 years since a comedy won best picture agent_1:That is weird.  Everyone likes comedy but I guess since everyone's tastes are different it's hard to single one thing out for an award.  Then again, tv shows are different.  3rd Rock from the Sun won best comedy series in 1997. It beat out the greats- Seinfeld, Friends, and Frasier. agent_2:I like all those shows! did you know empire strikes back somehow was nominated for a comedy award back in 1981 agent_1:No I didn't know that! I don't see how that could be considered a comedy at all.  That reminds me of the movie the green lantern. It was going to be a comedy originally. agent_2:haha that movie was horrible, did you ever see MOrtal Kombat 2?	agent_1:No I didn't see that.  I know a little about it though. Isn't it from a video game?  I don't know who is in it but I know it's not Tom Hanks.

Seen so many of his films.  agent_1:Yes you are right, have you seen E.T? if yes, did you like the movie, I know it's an old movie. agent_2:Yes it is an old movie. I like older movies. I remember when the game for the atari came out, they literally had to mass dump the product  in a field somewhere. agent_1:Yes I heard about that, but I wonder if the atari could have been recycle, just to think about all those Items were destroyed. agent_2:Yeah. its funny that he made all these movies here for all humans to see. Here on planet earth. A 4.5 million year old rock. I wonder if aliens seen our movies?  agent_1:yes you are right, I really like all the Jurassic Parks, I have watched those movies several times. agent_2:Dude!!! Tell me about it. Its crazy that Tom hanks made so much money. Making 8,5 billion worldwide and wasnt in any of the sagas. not in star wars and not in jurassic park. agent_1:Yes Tom Hanks made a lot of money also, did you know Steven Spielberg played the clarinet in jaws? agent_2:That is so cool how invlolved he is. I read that a movie named trojan wars costed $15,000,000 to make and only made $309. I need to find out what movie that is lol agent_1:Wow what a loss, did you know Steven Spielberg still make millions from star wars because a bet from George Lucas in 1977? agent_2:Yes I read that.

How is that different from a movie? agent_2:You interact with it.  In fact if you ignore it, it taunts you.  Intruders invade and all kinds of things happen.  agent_1:That sounds like a great way to have fun. I bet the story line is pretty good too. You don't kill things or earn points. Is it popular? agent_2:I would guess so, it's on many different consoles. In certain parts of the story there are minefields.  agent_1:I guess I should look into this. Do you use Playstation? agent_2:No.  The most significant thing is that it can have different endings.  agent_1:I don't really play video games much anymore. Do you? Do you use computers much? I do. agent_2:I use computers a lot.  Did you know Windows 95 was the 2nd most installed SW in 1995? agent_1:W95 was huge for its time. It got delayed several times, but it was a big jump for Microsoft. I used it a lot myself."	agent_2:Me too.  The first computer algorithm was written by a woman named Ada.

9379	agent_1:Hello, do you follow politics? agent_2:Hi, it's hard not to these days with everything going on in the news. agent_1:I agree. Did you know there hasn't been a president who wasn't a republican or democrat since 1853? agent_2:Wow I did not know it has been that long. I really think Bernie should run as an independent and not as democrat. The fear is always splitting the vote, but that happens anyway. agent_1:Yep that's true. Every president with a beard has always been a republican. agent_2:Really? I guess you're right. Of course the gop used to be completely different than the mess they are today. Only recently I discovered GOP stands for grand old party... agent_1:Oh wow I didn't know it stood for that either. The last time a republican was elected president without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was back in 1928. agent_2:Crazy, although I don't think there will be a Bush in 2020. Did you know when Hillary was in college she was president of young republicans? agent_1:That's hilarious. I did not know that about her.  agent_2:Yeah, the Republican party was a lot different more recently than people think. In fact Nixon was the only president ever to propose a guaranteed min income. Now people would probably like to reduce min wage to $2 an hour or something crazy.  agent_1:Oh wow I didn't know that either. I saw the red and blue colors associated with each party didn't start until 2000. agent_2:That is crazy. So recently yet it feels like they've always been that way. I think they should change the voting system so the popular vote counts for more. agent_1:Yea I'm not too sure what would work these days for the election.  agent_2:Elections are a mess, not just presidential. A dog has not only won an election for mayor but served as a mayor for 13 years! Dogs don't even live much past 13 lol. agent_1:I agree. LOL - that's pretty funny! During the 2012 US elections, international observers were blocked from the polls in nine states. agent_2:I can only imagine what 2020 is going to be like. Hopefully by then they start allowing you to vote online. I can't imagine it would be that hard. In Oregon elections are done by mail. Online would be a natural progression. agent_1:I agree. Since 1900, the taller candidate has won the election by 75%. agent_2:I guess if you're short it's barely worth running. Subconscious perceptions most likely or it's just a fluke. agent_1:LOL yep. I heard that is actually the case for interviews too. agent_2:There are certainly some weird facts. The faster blinker has in debates has lost every presidential election since 1980. I can't see how blinking speed would effect public opinion?	agent_1:It was good chatting with you!	agent_2 likes small talk. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['small talk', 'news', 'weird facts'].
12658	agent_1:Hello agent_2:Hello. Do you know the dog as the first species to be domesticated? agent_1:I did.  Had a discussion with a friend of mine about it last week.  They are all a bunch of little wolves.  agent_2:Their ancestry does go back to the wolf but dogs are more suited for human companionship. agent_1:Yeah, they took a notion to getting access to food.  Cats never really changed, they are still just cats.  Mini lions and tigers, really. agent_2:My own dog is good for hunting and for protection. I have a Boston. agent_1:Then your dog would be welcome at Google.  They are apparently anti-cat there.	agent_2:I heard that as well. Dogs are the perfect companion and well behaved if trained properly.	agent_1 likes pets. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['pets', 'dog', 'TV show'].
1403	agent_1:hello agent_2:Hello, Michael jackson has a patent. on a device used to achieve the extreme lean in some of his dance moves agent_1:That is extremely interesting actually. never knew that agent_2:I didn't either.  I guess for the song Smooth Criminal. agent_1:perhaps. what article you thought was the most interesting? agent_2:Tupac danced ballet in high school and ended up portraying the mouse king in a production of the nutcracker. agent_1:I found interesting the concept with rotten tomatoes. Poor people agent_2:Babies spontaneously dance when they hear music, and smile more when they hit the beat.  Dance is so interesting.  agent_1:Dance truly is interesting. As for the babies dancing spontaneously when they hear music, I totally agree. My child does the same agent_2:Mine do as well.  Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week. agent_1:That I certainly didn't know. She is still too little for ballet lol agent_2:Michael bay's average rotten tomatoes film rating is 38% agent_1:Quite surprising. Also Netflix has almost 150 movies with 100% rating on rotten tomatoes agent_2:I was just reading that.  How cool is that? I like to watch some of the stuff on Netflix. agent_1:I also like to watch movies on Netflix. Its convenient and the premium is not too high agent_2:Exactly, Spykids received a 93% fresh rating on rotten tomatoes, better than, say, lincoln or the dark knight rises. agent_1:true that. How about soundtracks. Any thoughts on that? agent_2:I didn't realize that Steven spielberg played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack. agent_1:Same here. Thought it was very interesting agent_2:No doubt.  The soundtrack to 'o brother, where art thou?' is certified 8 times platinum.	agent_1:yep.pretty fascinating	agent_2 likes science. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['science', 'TV shows', 'music'].
11138	agent_1:Do you know much about the US senate? agent_2:A little, I know people are up in arms over Kavanaugh's Supremo Court nomination.  agent_1:Yes very much so. That was quite the rough battle. Did you know that they had the same gavel for 165 years? agent_2:I heard that and then old Trick Dick broke it.  agent_1:Yes he did. Were you also aware that there is a candy desk in the senate? agent_2:Sounds about right is there anything good any it? agent_1:Yes, it's supplied with candy from Pennsylvania including milky ways, mars bars, and jelly beans.  agent_2:Well i guess sometimes you need a snack. Did you know that women until recently could not wear pants on the Senate floor? agent_1:That's very upsetting. Do you know how recently? agent_2:It wasn't until 1993 and two women had to be defiant to get their point across.  agent_1:What?! That's far too recent. I didn't realize sexism quite that blatant was so recent. Very upsetting. 	agent_2:Yes it is. In India the government set the polling booths in the forest full of lions.	agent_1 dislikes election. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['election', 'candy', 'candy from Pennsylvania'].
12702	"agent_1:I am not a fan of Mitch McConnell.  The senate majority leader has gone somewhat nuts. agent_2:Good afternoon, I try to avoid the political shenanigans.  It's just one shyster trying to get something over on the other guy, all the time.   agent_1:Yes but even in 2016 the CIA was meeting with senior congressional leaders over the fact that Putin had authorized an operation to destabilize our election agent_2:That's Putin for you, he's going to do that, hard to believe it took the CIA needing to tell them he was doing it.  I'm sure all of our ""frenemies""  do the same thing and we do it to them, too. agent_1:Yes but it is scary that McConnell is denying the evidence and claiming that it is just a scheme by the CIA to discredit Trump.  He does not believe all of our national security agencies. agent_2:On a different and much happier note than all that crazy political mess, do you realize the consistent use of the red and blue colors for Republicans and Democrats only started in 2000?  That's probably about the time it started to get real ugly in politics. agent_1:Yes that is crazy but it has been ugly for a while - Harry Truman visited disneyland and refused to be photographed on the dumbo ride because it might associate him with republicans! agent_2:You know the voter turnout for a US presidential election hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years.  I'm going to be watching 2020, I think Trump can break that! agent_1:Certainly he has 60 percent of the country who think he is doing a horrible job so it might increase the turnout!  Too bad we can't have third parties - there has not been one elected since 1853 agent_2:Actually, I think there are that many that WANT to vote for him and are going to turn out to vote against whatever candidate the Dems throw up there.  That third party thing has never seemed to work out too well, a shame."	agent_1:Well if he grew a beard it might help his chances - every president with a beard ever has been a republican	agent_2 likes politics. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'theme park', 'no'].
13828	agent_1:Hello, How are you tonight? Have you seen the Tesla car? agent_2:Yes I've actually driven in a Tesla before, what about you? I like that they have a lot of vehicles coming out like the model S and model X these days agent_1:Yeah, I heard they were coming out with new cars. Exciting!! What do you think of Elon Musk? I have watched him a few times in interviews. agent_2:Yeah he's very entertaining and interviews I think. It is crazy to me though that the Tesla Model S is so safe that somehow it broke the safety testing equipment, I don't know how that's possible LOL agent_1:Really, I agree, How does that happen? Saw where he took a  $78 million pay cut in 2014. agent_2:Yeah that is impressive. It's also impressive that Tesla releases their patents in order to encourage competition, I definitely would not do that if I owned the company haha agent_1:Most people wouldn't, wonder why? To help the environment? Who knows he probably got something else better lined up! agent_2:Yeah I agree. It's crazy though that they named themselves after Nikola Tesla, but they're not the only company that was named after him! There is another car company called just Nicola apparently	agent_1:Interesting, I owned an electric car for 3 years, it was an easy car to drive. My husband named it the phantom! He could never here when I got home. lol	agent_2 likes car. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['car', 'Tesla', 'car'].
3137	agent_1:Hey how is it going, you ever cook a turkey during Thanksgiving? agent_2:No, the only bird I ever cook is chicken; I'm looking to expand my skillset, though! They're the most numerically successful class of tetrapods. agent_1:Ah I gotcha, I was going to say there are some tips to maximize space in the oven during Thanksgiving, but that might just bore both of us haha. That's pretty cool about chickens, there are over 10000 birds that classify as tetrapods. agent_2:I'm sure that some like hummingbirds don't lend themselves to eating, but I know that ostrich steaks are a thing; I wonder how to cook those! I guess they can be so big because they don't fly. agent_1:True, I'm surprised they still have wings. I cannot believe how small hummingbirds are, only 2 inches! agent_2:I guess they're still evolving to the point where the wings disappear. Some birds don't get that chance--the famously extinct dodo bird is actually a sub-family a pigeon that I guess didn't evolve as much as it needed to! agent_1:Interesting, it's funny that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. That is really cool to me.	agent_2:That's very resourceful. Some wild birds in Australia are resourceful in mimicking the human world sounds of cameras, car alarms, and chainsaw, although I'm not sure exactly what purpose that would serve.	agent_1 likes hobby. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobby', 'cooking', 'chicken'].
13120	agent_1:Hi! Have you ever traveled to Japan?  agent_2:No, I have not but I have been to Hawaii and had family there when the ballistic missile threat message went out the morning of Jan. 13th. They were really scared. agent_1:Yeah, i remember that! With japan being so small it can cost you $300 to drive across it if you take the highway. Tolls are crazy expensive!  agent_2:Thats crazy! That is just like Hawaii too. agent_1:Are all of their Highways tolled? Are they expensive?  agent_2:They are really cram packed with cars but no tolls. The bad thing about being there is that a missile can get there from North Korea in less than 30  mins. agent_1:Whoa, thats crazy! I had no idea they were so close! Funny to think that China believes that Kim jong un is the sexiest man alive! agent_2:Wow, I did not know that! Yikes! In the era of Kim Jong-un we have to worry about his ability to send a missile over and that's a little scary. agent_1:I agree! Ill be interested to see how the meeting with US president goes later this month. I don't think he is stable.  He assassinated his own half brother.  agent_2:I agree.   He caused terror in Hawaii without even actually sending a missile. The people who were in church during the threat message were told to repent and to end mass early. Some people began crying and praying. agent_1:I would have been worried as well.Kim was ranked the 46th most powerful person in the world in 2013! Thats  troublesome!  agent_2:Oh, wow. That is a weird fun fact, huh. I think Forbes ranked him that. agent_1:Yep, you're right! I wonder if Forbes actually knows how old Kim is?  agent_2:HA! Good point, I doubt it. Its sort of weird that they participated in the Olympics in 2018. agent_1:I agree! I heard that south korea had to pick up the bill for North korea.  agent_2:Thats sounds about right! Everything n North Korea seems fake. Hopefully, Trump can get some more info during their talks. agent_1:hopefully so! They met in Singapore last year to discuss nuclear agreements, i wonder if thats what they will continue to discuss this time around or something else.  agent_2:I wonder that too. Did you know that Kim cuts his own hair? agent_1:hahah i would have thought he has someone else do that! agent_2:He is paranoid about getting hurt, I guess? Ha. agent_1:He should be. I dont think hes made many friends outside North Korea. Have a good day!

Have you seen it? agent_1:I have not seen that one. I haven't seen Justin Beiber's Baby either but that is probably good since it is the most disliked video on the platform.	agent_2:lol Poor Beib's.

11829	agent_1:Do you shop at LL Bean? agent_2:Yes, I do.  I wondered when they would stop their lifetime refund guarantee.  People nowadays are just plain crooked. agent_1:I was only just made aware of that offer.  There are always people willing to exploit a system like that.	agent_2:But, to go as far as to buy things at a yard sale and try to return them, that's just taking it to a new level of exploitation.  A crook will always be a crook, for sure!	agent_1 dislikes crime. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['crime', 'finance', 'no'].
5386	agent_1:hey there do you like baseball? Its the game that uses a ball and a bat agent_2:I do!  And then they run around the bases, if they are lucky enough to hit said ball. agent_1:Yeah that is true. It's crazy that baseball managers can actually join in the game, that's why they wear uniforms agent_2:Yes, if they need to play for their teams, I dont know why that would happen, but it might be fun to watch! agent_1:Yeah that could be cool. It's also cool that a man found millions of dollars worth of old baseball cards in his attic haha his grandfather and put them there and I guess forgotten about them? agent_2:Maybe, I should start checking my attic and see what treasures are stored up there.  I might have an early retirement.   agent_1:Haha yes I hope so! You know what is weird though? Have you ever played the game kickball, apparently it's called soccer-baseball in Canada for some reason agent_2:I guess it is a pretty accurate name too, however I much prefer kickball. agent_1:Uranium kickball sounds a lot better haha. What do you think about the Japanese? Apparently they are shocked to learn that baseball is actually America's pastime and was not invented in Japan agent_2:It is surprising, I bet they wonder why they are not invited to the world series either. agent_1:Haha yes I bet! I think it's interesting that the Women's World Cup higher television ratings than the World Series. I don't like soccer myself. agent_2:I would actually say I am a bigger soccer fan than Baseball.  Especially when it comes to world cups.	agent_1:Yeah I don't really like either game haha. It is crazy though that the World Series actually started back in 1903, so I do respect its long history.	agent_2 dislikes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'favorite sport', 'sports'].
1083	agent_1:What did you think of the last couple elections? agent_2:I think it has been great for the country. people have come to realize the power of the vote. agent_1:That is a great point. I want to keep seeing more and more voter turnout. It hasn't been more than 62.8 percent in 100 years agent_2:the vote should be mandatory. then people would see the power of the ballot. agent_1:I agree, I am sure other countries do that. I don't think we should go back to how ancient athens did it, do you know how? agent_2:i think they used a lottery. that would help avoid power falling into certain hands consistenly. agent_1:yea and hoping the lottery would not allow an oligarchy. I wonder if that worked or not agent_2:it probably slowed it down. officials can still bribed, even randomly elected ones.	agent_1:Yea you're right. I am sure it was rigged. How do you like Republicans?	agent_2 dislikes politics. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'politics', 'yes'].
1687	agent_1:Good Morning! Do you like to watch horror films? agent_2:Hi, how are you? I am not really a fan of the genre, though I have some favorites. agent_1:What are some of your favorite ones? Stephen king considers Bambi one haha. agent_2:King was just a kid, to be fair. That movie could be scary to a tiny child. He then turned his fright into a profession. agent_1:You're right on that one. Did you know you can burn 180 calories watching one? agent_2:I suppose that I could try to lose weight that way. It might be easier to exercise. I like a couple of films, but after the first viewing, they are not as scary. agent_1:Just do a marathon one day of watching them and you'll be set. Have you seen the Shining? The boy actor didn't even know it was a horror film until years later. agent_2:I liked the Shining. King wrote a great story and it translated well to the screen. I am surprised by the kid though. What did he think it was? agent_1:That is a good question. You would think watching the cinematography alone would let you know it was one! agent_2:I wonder if he ever saw the film while he was a kid. I think maybe his parents wouldn't let him.  agent_1:That could be it! Did you know no woman has ever been nominated for best cinematography at the oscars? agent_2:That is a shame. I don't know how many women cinematographers there are, but probably not enough. There should be more. agent_1:I agree with you! Especially with the box office at what it is. I would hate to work for the movie Trojan Wars. They made only 309 dollars on a budget of 15 million! agent_2:Movies are such a crapshoot. There is no magic formula for success. Stars, special FX, marketing. Doesn't matter. agent_1:They really are, even with the big names. Tom Hanks has earned 8.5 billion in film earnings for his movies. agent_2:He is a bankable star. People love him. But he also works with certain people regularly. Spielberg. Zemeckis. They are capable directors. agent_1:Oh for sure! Have you seen Disney's Treasure Planet? That was one of the most expensive box office flops ever. agent_2:I did not. Was that animated? Usually animated stuff is pretty good. I'm surprised. agent_1:I am surprised too, especially with the Disney name attached to it!	agent_2:I guess a lot depends on the director. I don't know who directed Treasure Planet.	agent_1 dislikes movie. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'women', 'cinematographer'].
6239	"agent_1:So how bout them Yankees? agent_2:How are they doing? agent_1:They are perennially amoung the leaders in the MLB attendance and made the post season 2 years in a row agent_2:Do you believe that Osuna has served a 75 game suspension due to domestic violence  agent_1:That's crazy, I don't know what the Astro's were thinking taking the trade from the Blue Jays agent_2:I wonder why he's allowed back agent_1:I guess it's his first offense and they are waiting to find out about his upcoming court hearing agent_2:oh.  the Astros think Osuna is remorseful and had enough counseling to not harm anyone in baseball I guess agent_1:I guess they are giving him a ""fresh start"" which means as long as he plays good we don't care agent_2:He says he won't let them down. agent_1:If they are serious of giving him a fresh start they should wait till next year, he hasn't pitched in the majors since May 6 anyway"	agent_2:The trade left the Astros in a sticky situation.

13546	agent_1:Hello.   What do you think of Pluto-planet or not? agent_2:If it were up to me it would be a planet. Seems silly to deem it otherwise. agent_1:I agree.  I don't like how the parameters for what is a planet and what isn't is determined by where and what they orbit. agent_2:Yeah but humans are a weird species, they have laws and rules for everything agent_1:True.  Look at Jupiter's moon Ganymede.  If it orbited the sun it would be a planet by definition. agent_2:Yeah and there is also a planet that orbits 4 stars, that's crazy. agent_1:I wonder how that works. I guess the stars are close together?   agent_2:Maybe, but they would have to be far enough apart so they are not affected by each others gravity fields yet be able to influence the planet that is orbiting them. agent_1:That's true.  So that would mean a very large galaxy.  What do you think of the planet where shards of glass precipitate sidewys at 4500 mph in 2000 degree fahrenheit weather?	agent_2:Man that would be scary, imagine is it started raining glass on earth, we would be screwed.	agent_1 dislikes weather. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['weather', 'astronomy', 'law'].
5372	agent_1:Do you follow basebal? The Nationals traded Daneil Murphy and Matt Adams agent_2:Yes I do. I didn't know that. Who's your favorite team? agent_1:I'm a Yankees fan, I never knew Babe Ruth was caught stealing home in the 1926 World Serires agent_2:It's surprising, you don't hear many bad things about Babe Ruth. I like the Dodgers therefore I am anti-yankee. agent_1:They had a great rivalry when both were in NY. It's crazy Babe Ruth would ever try to steal a base considering how big he was agent_2:I wonder how many stolen bases he had in his career. Maybe he thought he could just run the catcher over. agent_1:That would be an interesting fact to know. It's pretty crazy the Ottoman Empire was still around when the Cubs won back to back World Series agent_2:Yes the Cubs have suffered from the curse of the goat. agent_1:Who knew a man with a goat could wield such great power agent_2:Remind me not to make an enemy of anyone carrying a goat. I wonder if that's where the saying being a goat came from. Like Ruth was the goat after losing that game. agent_1:I don'tknow, maybe, Billy Sianis goat did stink agent_2:Probably so. Did you know the Cubs and Braves started playing the same year as the battle of the little bighorn? agent_1:That is pretty crazy, I wonder if any of the people from the Battle of Little Bighorn ever saw a Cubs game agent_2:I don't know. How do you feel about people today complaining about teams that are named after Native Americans, like the Braves? agent_1:Depends on how respectful it's done, the Braves don't have a bad logo but the Indians logo is pretty messed up agent_2:The native americans don't seem to have a problem with it. It's just other people, strange. agent_1:I wonder if there are any baseball controversies in Japan, baseball is really popular there agent_2:Yes it is, and they have some pretty good players. I wonder if they will ever be allowed to play for the world series.	agent_1:Maybe one day, but for now it's just between the AL and NL champions	agent_2 likes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'basebal', 'sports'].

Pretty cool.  agent_1:ya he ruined it! there is a Candy desk in the senate apparently, sounds delicious! agent_2:That does sound pretty good! Michael Jordan once responded that republicans buy shoes too so he didn't endorse the democratic candidate.  agent_1:haha well I wish more people took his advice and kept out of politics, really weird that women couldnt wear pants in the senate until 1993 agent_2:haha yea I was just reading that. Said something about staging a protest wearing pantsuits.  agent_1:ya it was Barbara Mikulski and Carl Moseley who did a protest by wearing pantsuits agent_2:That's funny. Did you know there hasn't been a president who wasn't a republican or democrat since 1853? agent_1:no that is kind of crazy, also crazy is that only republicans have beards apparently, no democrat presidents have had one agent_2:Wow that's crazy I had no idea they never have had a beard as a democrat.  agent_1:no I didn't either, also crazy is that the use of red and blue colors only started in 2000 for repubs and ems agent_2:Interesting....I didn't know that either. The last republican was elected  president without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was 1928.	agent_1:wow, but I think that is outdated information because Trump is now president haha	agent_2 dislikes politics. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'history', 'no'].

Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer as well as kung fu star and won the Hong Kong Cha-Cha championship in 1958. agent_1:That's cool,never would have pictured him doing the Cha Cha but it takes the same skills probably to perform Kung Fu. agent_2:Other stars you would not expect, Tupac danced ballet and was the Mouse King in his high school production of the Nutcracker. agent_1:Wow, Tupac?  You must be pulling my leg!  Never could he be a ballet dancer.  Wow! agent_2:I know but creative people are drawn to the arts. Just like how babies are drawn to music. They will spontaneously dance when they hear music and smile when they hit the beat. agent_1:Speaking of ballet, did you know that ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week? agent_2:That is a lot of shoes. They must need it for all the extreme moves they perform. Kind of like Michael Jackson's extreme lean that he has a patent on. agent_1:You're probably right! agent_2:Some birds are so beautiful it is almost like they are dancing in flight. Hummingbirds are some of my favorites. Did you know they steal spiderwebs to build their nests?	agent_1:Yes, birds are amazing.

That is exciting for Dodger fans. agent_1:Yea their starter Ryu had a great game pitching 7 innings without a run agent_2:I heard Maz Muncy had a three-run, second inning blast. 	agent_1:Yea it's amazing how many home runs were hit last season, with the Yankess setting a record 267 in a season	agent_2 likes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'Dodgers', 'baseball'].

A woman in harlem hosts free concerts in her apartment every day agent_1:Yes for 20 years now and many people stop by there agent_2:Yeah. Do you know who has the best jazz orchestra in the world? agent_1:Yes that is Pakistan, strange a bit but good for them agent_2:I know. Do you know why trumpeters have a goatee? agent_1:Yes because it is more comfortable when they play agent_2:Yes. Do you like Pixar? agent_1:I sure do, they also have a room where only celebrities are allowed in agent_2:Yeah. Did you know RObin Williams was the voice of Aladdin? agent_1:Yes and he started that trend of celebrities doing voices agent_2:Yeah.

Apparently there is a lizard with no legs and i always though that was what a snake was, lol.  agent_2:really? I wonder what separates the two from each other then, i have to imagine they look very similar agent_1:You would think but that's not what they pay me for, ha. Maybe we should move to new zealand they don't have snakes there. agent_2:i agree, snakes are so creepy, they are a very lucky country in my opinion agent_1:Mine too. Apparently fear of snakes is hard wired into our brains and monkeys. agent_2:maybe it is because of the way that they move or the noises that they make? I cannot think of why that may be the case agent_1:Me either. Do you know who Taylor Swift is?  agent_2:I do, I am a big fan of her music! agent_1:she was born on December 13 1989. one of her albums won 4 grammy's.  agent_2:she is very successful, she also owns a private jet, she is doing very well for herself agent_1:Yes she is and to be so young it's great! that jet is a Falcon 900 and cost 40 million right? Those are really nice. agent_2:yes, that is more than I will see in my lifetime, but I am glad she was able to make so much in her career before she loses popularity	agent_1:Well hopefully she did well with the money she made so far because fame don't last forever. 	agent_2 dislikes career. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['career', 'food', 'music'].
12473	agent_1:Did You know that humans may have lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago ? agent_2:I think that fact is misleading. After all, we still have plenty of body hair today. I think it would be more accurate to say humans lost their fur (a consistent/extensive hair covering) within the last 240,000 years ago. agent_1:wow ;) we had fur ? ;) agent_2:What do you think animal hair is? That's why I find wearing actual animal fur so disgusting. I wouldn't wear the skin and hair of another human. Why would I want to wear the skin of an animal? agent_1:no, what I meant was - did WE - humans had fur in the past ? agent_2:Well, yes. Technically we still have fur today (although it is spotty). Fur is the covering of hair used to protect an animal and help it control its temperature and reactions to the climate. agent_1:ok... I've never thought about it this way... agent_2:I think once you adjust your mindset and realize how close we are to modern-day animals, you begin to change how you think of the animals themselves. agent_1:We are modern days animals ? how so... we just sit all day and look at the monitor :) agent_2:We're not just modern-day animals. We ARE animals. Homo sapiens are part of Hominina, which is a subtribe of Animalia (how we classify animals). agent_1:Well at least from a name , ok, but we are logical, spiritual and very intelligent... I don't know if one can call us animals :) agent_2:I disagree. I think animals are also very logical and intelligent. If you think about it, they are smarter than us. Humans are responsible for destroying the planet - and not only are we aware of that, we are consciously choosing to continue! agent_1:...but the fact that we are self-aware should make us something more than animals... agent_2:Animals are very much self-aware. They can plan for the future and cater their reactions to their environments. That is why you see so much of the animal kingdom continuing to thrive in the face of human interference.	agent_1:Interesting... but You can't really say they are smarter than us ;) we may be more evil, but we are still smarter :)	agent_2 dislikes evil. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['evil', 'history', 'human hair'].

No kids here, but what is Cupcake and Dino? agent_2:Apparently it is a kids show, but I've never seen it. Maybe it is a movie.  agent_1:Have you seen the Christopher Robin film?  I was wondering how it was. agent_2:No, I didn't. It sounds like it could have been good Ewan McGregor is a pretty good actor.  agent_1:Yes, he is.  I didn't go see it, because I thought people would look at me strange seeing a ""kids"" movie.  But I always liked Winnie the Pooh, as a child. agent_2:It was a good show. Did you know Christopher Robin was a real boy?  agent_1:I heard that he was the author's son in real life.  That's so cool, talk about having a book written about you. agent_2:I don't know if I could handle that to be honest. agent_1:Me either. Lol The New York public library is the home of the real Winnie the pooh toy teddy bear.  I saw it once on a school trip, it looked old and raggedy. agent_2:I didn't know that. So they still have it?

It's animated, right? With lots of songs? agent_2:Yes it uses computer animation and it has love songs. It was super popular. There's a song that all the little kids were saying called""Let It Go and I guess it's based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale called the snow queen agent_1:HC wrote so many great stories. I read the Snow Queen a long time ago. I don't remember it.Has the movie won any awards? agent_2:I'm pretty sure that it has, I know that it made a ton of money. Apparently the villain used to sing that song I mentioned, Let It Go, but the song was so happy that they changed the character agent_1:that's good thinkg. I bet the song is up for an award somewhere. Who were the people involved in the film? agent_2:There's like a princess, a reindeer and a snowman, they're like them three most important characters. Also this is the first movie that was produced by Walt Disney and directed by a woman. agent_1:Not many films get directed by woman. That's good that she got the job. Good for Disney! They know how to spot talent. agent_2:I think so. Apparently she was the first female director of a film that earned over 1 billion dollars too. So that is another record that she set agent_1:Disney has won a ton of awards, and I'm sure she'll win awards as well. agent_2:Oh I'm Sure. Do you like dogs by the way? We used to have a husky ourselves agent_1:A dog is a great friend, but no, I have never had a dog. I enjoy playing with them though. agent_2:Dogs are awesome, I think anyway, they have like 12 different blood types and apparently there are dog blood drives that exist agent_1:I wonder how the dogs are rewarded at the drive. People get cookies and orange juice. agent_2:I know right? I hope that the dogs get a treat at least haha. Did you know that Istanbul has vending machines that reward stray dogs for bringing back trash? agent_1:The Turks know the value of recycling and that dogs are keen to help for reward. agent_2:Oh for sure! One other thing I didn't know is that dogs and elephants are the only animals that respond to pointing. I want a pet elephant haha! agent_1:Good luck with that elephant! Anyway I enjoyed chatting with you! agent_2:I enjoyed chatting with you as well! And yes I'll go to local pet store and see if they have elephants in stock haha agent_1:Have a good night"	agent_2:Thanks you too!

When your assistant can't talk to your music to play on your speakers, there's a problem! agent_1:i have a huge problem getting alexa to connect too sometimes tho. it always tries to open ""spotty control""... my husband and I always joke that we are an ""amazon family"" i didn't realize how true that was until I learned that amazon has owned IMDB since 98! agent_2:Since '98? No kidding! I guess it makes sense for a company that started as a bookstore to branch out into movies next. agent_1:yeah, i remember when they only sold books. a distant memory i think. now the workers walk 7-15 miles each shift. agent_2:That makes me wonder how many miles the goats Google used to trim their grass traveled. Maybe 15 miles? agent_1:hahaha google has some wild things. I used to live in the bay and their workspace is very unique. agent_2:You've seen the Googleplex? Neat! What's it like? agent_1:they have a lot of different campuses all over palo alto and san francisco. it is very well kempt. and there are google bikes EVERYWHERE. agent_2:That sounds about what you'd expect from the provider of so much web traffic. agent_1:yeah when they went down for a bit a few years ago web traffic dropped 40%. yahoo must have been happy for five minutes. agent_2:Poor Yahoo. Apple has Siri, Microsoft has Cortana... I'm sad that Ask.com isn't still around. I want to have Jeeves as my personal assistant! agent_1:that is a throwback. Cortana isn't very useful, but I like bing as a search engine...and i like that they pay you points that can be changed in for giftcards. agent_2:Cortana was helpful in Halo at least. Can't really picture Siri hanging out with Master Chief. agent_1:my friend met the siri lady in an airport once. that was interesting.  agent_2:Hah! I wonder how the male voice actors feel. Mr. Briggs didn't even know he WAS the voice until he heard himself in a commercial. agent_1:yeah talk about being the weakest link. I wonder how that happens though...like don't they have to pay for his voice? agent_2:Maybe it was some kind of contract work, and the client wasn't disclosed."	agent_1:maybe that is a good point. thanks for chatting, I had a great time talking. :)	agent_2 likes conversation. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['conversation', 'video games', 'video game character'].

For instance, there is a poem where if you read it one way it's sad, but read it in reverse and it's actually inspirational! agent_1:Wow, I bet that poem required a lot creativity, wrtting a poem with completely different meanings, oposing genres, genius agent_2:There is one guy that wrote a poem of over 220 words in palindrome (where it is the same backwards and forwards -- like ""nurses run"")! agent_1:Sounds really hard, did you ever read one of Edgar Allan Poe's poems? agent_2:I think I read a couple.  I feel like I know them so well because of horror and Halloween stories.  I know ""The Raven"" was pretty popular.  Do you think he made a lot of money with that poem? agent_1:Not really in fact he only made $9 for the publication of that poem, seems really underpaid agent_2:Wow!  That is crazy!  I hope he had a good day job.  Maybe just regular fiction works would have been better financially. agent_1:I hope he did as well, the raven is like his most popular poem and selling it for $9, business was slow, he also wrote cyborg fiction, agent_2:That's pretty cool.  If he'd had a black character in it in the 1950s that was worthy of banning a science fiction comic!"	agent_1:That sounds really racist, theres a wiki rank of fictional characters according to power and abilities,  I wonder who is the strongest hero	agent_2 likes hero. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hero', 'hobby', 'poetry'].

I wonder how many people had TV then? agent_1:Good question.  Freddie mercury used the same piano to record bohemian rhapsody as paul mccartney used to record hey jude agent_2:cool! ever hears of Eurovision? agent_1:No, what's that? agent_2: Song Contest in england. agent_1:Oh ok.  In 2006 a group of climbers reached the top of britain's highest mountain and found a piano agent_2:neat! apparently the competition away from its usual reliance on over-the-top spectacle. agent_1:An aluminum grand piano was built for the lounge of the airship hindenburg. it weighed only 356 pounds. agent_2:Wow! I did not know that! Portuguese broadcaster RTP had stripped the Eurovision stage of the walls of LED screens that have become ubiquitous backdrops in recent years. agent_1:When eddie van halen recorded the guitar solo for ""beat it"" he literally set the studio speakers on fire. agent_2:Oh my gosh! DO you like Jazz? agent_1:No, not really.  You? agent_2:Some, but Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans. agent_1:There is a programming language in which the programs are written in musical composition, and functional programs have jazz-like harmonies. agent_2:I had no idea! Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, agent_1:A harlem woman has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every sunday for 20 years. top performers occasionally stop by. agent_2:Thats neat! New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation. agent_1:Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts. agent_2:Clint eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast, pianist, and scored several films, including million dollar baby. agent_1:Clint Eastwood movies are awesome agent_2:they are/ I like grand Torino especially. what is your fave? agent_1:That's great one.

I want to keep seeing more and more voter turnout. It hasn't been more than 62.8 percent in 100 years agent_2:the vote should be mandatory. then people would see the power of the ballot. agent_1:I agree, I am sure other countries do that. I don't think we should go back to how ancient athens did it, do you know how? agent_2:i think they used a lottery. that would help avoid power falling into certain hands consistenly. agent_1:yea and hoping the lottery would not allow an oligarchy. I wonder if that worked or not agent_2:it probably slowed it down. officials can still bribed, even randomly elected ones. agent_1:Yea you're right. I am sure it was rigged. How do you like Republicans? agent_2:well, they can be bribed after the fact once elected. The country has shifted farther right, so they are pretty far right now. agent_1:Yea that is a good point. is your governer part of that far right? agent_2:no, i dont think so. i think that the far right is usually in the south. 	agent_1:Yea I think so too, our governor is republican but not a far right one.

Can you believe Linkin Park did 324 concerts in 2001 alone? agent_2:I cant imagine having that much energy. they must have slept on the bus. how could they do that? agent_1:Pure adrenaline probably haha. They could have been like the Ramones touring for 20 straight years. I wonder how many concerts they put on? agent_2:Probably over 100 a year, so about 2000?  agent_1:It looks like 2263 in total! You were close! At least they weren't as bas a Creed doing concerts lol. agent_2:Is Creed a christian rock band? it sounds religious. agent_1:They were some terrible rock group in the early 2000s.

Very interesting though, also I read someone built a 16 bit computer using nothing but Minecraft building blocks, so crazy how these people get these idea's. agent_2:I know agent_1:So do you like the piano?  agent_2:I accidentally hit the enter tab, I was going to say I know, the world is full with creativity, and I do like the piano I like the sound of it. agent_1:Me too, I did play years ago but not anymore. I love the soothing sound of it. years ago the bbc didn't have any news worth reporting so the just played piano music lol that's awesome. agent_2:That odd considering the news giant BBC is today! did you know that Freddy Mercury played the same piano as Paul McCartney agent_1:My thoughts exactly! Oh wow that's an interesting fact! They built a piano for the Hindenburg and it only weighed over 300 pounds, who would think of putting a piano on that airship!	agent_2:That takes some useful weight out of the plane, and maybe someone that is a real piano fan, would be nice to listen to it in the sky though.	agent_1 likes music. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'TV show', 'TV character'].

You must be pulling my leg!  Never could he be a ballet dancer.  Wow! agent_2:I know but creative people are drawn to the arts. Just like how babies are drawn to music. They will spontaneously dance when they hear music and smile when they hit the beat. agent_1:Speaking of ballet, did you know that ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week? agent_2:That is a lot of shoes. They must need it for all the extreme moves they perform. Kind of like Michael Jackson's extreme lean that he has a patent on. agent_1:You're probably right! agent_2:Some birds are so beautiful it is almost like they are dancing in flight.

Were you a subscriber even back when their whole business model was about DVD rental by mail and not an online platform? agent_2:I was! I think it was in 2007 when they started adding streaming features. agent_1:It's interesting to think how differently the company could have been if decisions played out differently. Like Blockbuster declining to buy them many times, and now they're worth many times over. agent_2:Exactly! A purchase of $50 million that is now worth $2 billion. That is just CRAZY! agent_1:And I feel like that doesn't even big to desribe how huge Netflix is still. Netflix accounts for a third of ALL bandwith in North America from 9pm to 12 am! agent_2:Which is honestly just nuts. And when you combine Netflix and youtube, it's half of the peak internet traffic in North America alone! agent_1:I was surprised to learn recently though, that despite how huge their online platform is, they still do DVD rentals! And spend 20 times more on postage than their bandwith. agent_2:True - but I think they might need to start paying more attention to what they are spending - they racked up $21.9 billion in debt as of Sept 2017 trying to get content! agent_1:That's certainly a lot of money! Although at least it's an investment and will come back to them. On the other hand, I remember a decade ago, Tom Cruise spent $10 million on an underground bunker to protect himself from aliens, what a nut. agent_2:I stopped liking him when he went all about Scientology. I much prefer other actors now, like Peter Dinklage. agent_1:I've never heard of him, does he do a lot of action movies? I like Tom Cruise because of movies like Top Gun and Cocktail but I'm always interested in expanding my preferences. agent_2:Actually, Peter Dinklage plays Tyrion Lannister on Game of Thrones!  agent_1:Oh wow! That's a beautiful show I've been meaning to watch, it's filmed in Ireland I think! And from the limited parts I've seen the scenery is gorgeous. agent_2:Yes. It is my most favorite show - which it definitely has earned with all of its Emmys - 47 to be exact!  agent_1:That's a whole lot! They're certainly influential, I read somewhere that Arya is the fastest rising baby name for girls in the US, due to a character from the Game of Thrones. agent_2:My daughter is named Arya. So we definitely fell into the trend! I am sad it is going to end this year, with the last season starting in April. agent_1:Oh wow that's very cool! Hey at least if you ever want to pick up a new show after, Nat Geo Wild has a show that parodies Game of Thrones but follows lions! agent_2:I heard about that! I think that would be awesome - following them like the characters in the show!	agent_1:Yeah absolutely, regardless it will be cool to see if Netflix can makea similar show themselves after Game of Thrones ends.

4126	agent_1:Which city is home to Netflix? agent_2:I've heard it's from Los Gatos in California. Do you use Netflix? agent_1:Yes.    I heard they have a lot of users worldwide.    Do you know how many? agent_2:I don't, but I use it to watch a few shows. What kind of stuff do you watch on it? agent_1:I love the movie Apollo 13 on netflix.    Can you believe that film inspired the whole service! agent_2:No kidding? I had no idea! It's amazing what good cinematography can inspire in others. agent_1:Nothing to do with the film, but founder Reed Hastings forgot to return a VHS tape and got $40 in late fees and wanted to do something about it! agent_2:Hah, I guess cinematography isn't everything. I think we all know how he must have felt getting a late fee. If only everyone were as determined to do something about frustrations! agent_1:True.    I do like cinematography though.     It is amazing what can come from a lens and light.	agent_2:Cinematography is so fascinating. It's like an intersection of physics and visual art, because of all the dependence on understanding how light and lenses work.	agent_1 likes movies. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movies', 'TV show', 'Netflix'].

Do you have a pet? agent_2:I have a dog and two cats and you? agent_1:I have a cat. Domesticated animals have a white patch on the forehead it seems agent_2:I do not think my pets have that though to be honest agent_1:Mine either. Do you know who we have hiccups? agent_2:Yes they are left behind from when animals had gills and lungs agent_1:Yeah. Did you know the loch ness monster is a protected species? agent_2:So cool.

Neat that he was a ballet dancer.  Speaking of ballet dancers, I'm told they go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a WEEK.  Talk about being on your toes! agent_1:They sure do! Michael Jackson had specially made shoes for some of his own dance moves. agent_2:Wonder if that how he was able to do that ""extreme lean"" move he does.  (I'm told he owns a patent on the device, but dunno if the device is shoes or something else...)

I find it funny that Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Greek mythology. agent_1:That is sort of odd.  There is even a wiki that ranks fictional characters by their powers, that would be an interesting read. agent_2:And in Greek literature there wasn't much kissing. Romantic kissing is actually a recent development. agent_1:That surprises me, I  guess I always associated it with all love stories.  Even Shakespeare.	agent_2:Yeah I think there was a lot of romance just kissing wasn't part of it.	agent_1 dislikes romance. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['romance', 'hobby', 'reading'].
10215	agent_1:I am not a super Phil Collins fan-are you? agent_2:Hello there, I am not but he does have a few good songs.  agent_1:He has done a lot of stuff. I am more of a Mick Jagger person. I think the era of mega stars like that is over. Too bad. agent_2:Yeah Mick was awesome, the Stones had so many great hits over the years.  I can't believe they still tour!  That is impressive! agent_1:He is my age and I can't even get out of bed in the morning. He's a marvel. agent_2:Lol, yeah and their shows are like 2 hrs i'm pretty sure, that is so nuts.  Do you attend many concerts these days? agent_1:Not now-too expensive. The first time I saw Led Zeppelin was at a place called The Boston Tea Party. They had just come to America and no one knew who they were. It was a small Club so I got to see them up close. agent_2:That is awesome, they were one of the best ever, very jealous of you.   agent_1:I saw a lot of people there. Andy Warhol was a sponsor. I think I liked BB King the best. But I don't remember Phil Collins. agent_2:Wow, that sounds like an amazing time.  BB King would be awesome to see as well.  I have only been to smaller bands, I did see Radiohead play though, that was pretty cool, but to be honest I mainly went to see the opening band! agent_1:It was easy to see everyone in the Sixties. Tickets were cheap and a lot of people played on the Boston Common. Judy Colling and Joan Baez used to sit on the sidewalk in front of the Harvard Coop and play for free. agent_2:Wow, that is so awesome, most of the music I listen to comes from the 60's, I would have done anything to see Marc Bolan or Syd Barrett perform live.  agent_1:I like Pink Floyd! I don't see that We are the Champions is the catchiest tune ever. That makes no sense. agent_2:Good call! Yeah I don't agree with that at all.  There are plenty more catchy tunes from the 50's and 60's I would say.  agent_1:I would have liked to see Pink Floyd in a Roman Amphitheater. I bet the sound was really good. agent_2:Yeah that would have been cool, so many concerts over the years that would have been amazing to attend.  agent_1:I used to like the music really loud but I saw Led Zeppelin (after they got to be famous) at the Boston Garden and it was too loud. Ever one lit little candles-you couldn't do that now. The Fire Marshall would have a heart attack. lol agent_2:Yeah imagine them trying to do things like that now, no way!  So, be glad you got to experience it like that I would say.  agent_1:Everyone was friendly and there was no trouble. Can you imagine? agent_2:Yeah exactly, now days there are always people to ruin everything, and it can't just be fun and simple anymore. 	agent_1:You are right. Sad but true.

Did you know he popularized many terms that we use to this day? agent_1:Yes terms like, good riddance, in my heart of heart and such agent_2:Yes. He lives at the same time as Pocahontas did agent_1:I wonder if they had met what he would have written about her. agent_2:Yeah good point. He also invented some women's names agent_1:Yes among those are Olivia, Miranda and Jessica agent_2:Yeah. Did you know that his works have to stick to the old english language to make sense? agent_1:Yes especially with punk and rhymes, they do not work with modern language agent_2:Yeah.

Tennis is fun too. a black man won the us open in 1968 and no other black man has since then. That would be award worthy agent_2:Yes they should make a movie about him! it's interesting to that until 1978 you could use any object as a tennis racket, that sounds dangerous agent_1:That would be hilarious to see what some  people came up with. What would  you use? lol agent_2:I would use a rocket launcher LOL just kidding. do you watch soccer at all? Apparently soccer makes more than all other sports combined agent_1:Lol that would be perfect, no opponent means you  win everytime!  agent_2:That's a great point! Did you know that table tennis is the name of the actual sport, and that ping pong is only the name of the company that sells the table tennis equipment?	agent_1:I did not know that, wow! Mind blown!

Are you explain about baseball. agent_1:Well, baseball is a really fun sport between two teams, the offensive , who are the batters and the defensive who are in the field. agent_2:oh...very nice explanation.  agent_1:Then the batter team, once they get to hit the ball, they run the bases and If they complete the bases, they score a run agent_2:wow...very interesting game.

That's pretty cool. Isn't that one lady from Bri bang also like a pHd? agent_2:I'm not sure but wouldn't doubt it. Facebook is developing AI designed to better understand emotions, identify objects, and predict user actions. Yikes.  agent_1:Clifford seems to be a great way to augment teaching. I would like to see a pre and post test with a control group to see how well the AI works. agent_2:Interesting. At Stanford they use Google Hangouts to teach AI more effectively.  agent_1:That's interesting. I teach college courses and would love to see how that works. I wonder if the non-for-profit has more info on it. agent_2:Good question. How about this one -- there's a NASA scientist who believes our world is just a computer generated VR. Maybe he's been watching too much of The Matrix.  agent_1:That's nuts. I sometimes wonder if the ultra-intelligent need things to maintain their sanity... agent_2:Haha. Definitely. Overthinking can be a torture, I'm sure. The first Virtual Reality game was created in 1968. How far we've come! agent_1:I would love to go on Lockheed Martin's virtual reality tour of mars. seems like it would be a lot of fun. agent_2:It does sound fun. Up to 40% of VR users get motion sickness -- me included. So make sure to take your barf bag if you go, just in case.  agent_1:I never thought of that impact on people. Have you ever gone on 4D rides at like disney? They move and shake but then they also spray water on you for when you go through water tunnels or something like that.

People think that the polo was created by a polo player but it was actually created by a tennis player haha. How weird agent_2:I know, Rene made history with those shirts so many people prefer them now agent_1:Haha I like how his nickname was the ""crocodile"" and now polos have crocodiles on them. That actually makes a lot of sense haha. agent_2:Yes it does  and there is a whole brand named Lacoste. What an invention agent_1:Yep he's a genius haha. Another genius is the guy who used a helicopter to dry grass tennis courts back in 1969 agent_2:Talk about innovation, wow. Do you know how long the longest game in tennis took? agent_1:Wasn't it like 3 days. But the game was only 11 hours but still that's a ton! Do you think it's weird that only one black man has won the US Open? agent_2:Yeah I find that weird too. Do you know Roger Federer, who he is? agent_1:I do know Rodger Federer. He's actually really awesome at tennis. I can't believe that one guy beat him after learning how to play tennis only a couple days earlier. In fact that is astounding to me agent_2:Yeah that is cool. And he once competed with Nadal in a field half of which was clay agent_1:Wow I didn't know that. I guess he was also gifted two cows for winning some games. I can think of a lot better prizes personally haha agent_2:And he is the only person in Switzerland that is honored with an official stamp agent_1:That's cool. One funny thing is that he did a stretch that was too wide and apparently tore his meniscus period and that was drawing a bath for his daughter LOL agent_2:Wow, you never know.

They carry so much information and resources and services. agent_1:i worry about the internet. i think that it could be addictive and that i might lose myself in it. the clicking, the constant clicking. agent_2:That is definitely a valid concern. What is weird is that humans are the minority on the Internet outnumbered by automated software programs. agent_1:i did not know that. we are monitored all the time. even these very chats that we do could be handled by bots in the future. then what? agent_2:Yes that's a good question I'm not sure what would happen then. One cool thing is that in Finland everyone has the right to an Internet connection. agent_1:i think that is great. people need to be connected for work and school and also to make friends. maybe not bot friends though. agent_2:Agreed. When people look themselves up on the internet it is called egosurfing. I wonder if bots egosurf lol? agent_1:that would be funny. comparing themselves to other bots. the narcissstic bot. that would be their downfall agent_2:Yeah it would! What is crazy is that astronauts in space have faster internet than most american homes! agent_1:that would make sense to me. i guess they need a speedy link to send and receive data. do you believe in extraterrestrials? agent_2:Yeah true. I do although we have never made contact. Even the ancient greeks wrote stories about them! agent_1:i guess the skies seemed mysterious to them too. what is up there past the stars? they must have wondered. i figure that one day we will make contact, but not the way we expect. agent_2:Yeah I don't think we will. The president of the world chess federation believe chess was invented by aliens. That is certainly an odd theory lol. agent_1:why aliens? it is not such a strange game. simple pieces, simple board, simple moves. complex strategy. agent_2:Yes my thoughts precisely. Well at least we are prepared. The UN has a contingency plan just in case! agent_1:I dont have too much faith in that. the UN doesnt speak alien. And they would probably protect themselves. agent_2:Yeah agreed. Maybe the USA needs its own plan? The sequel to charlie and the chocolate factory has aliens! agent_1:What? that is strange.

I wonder if you can buy products on amazon agent_1:I'm sure you can, might be more than $27.95, that was the amount spent by the first customer on Amazon. agent_2:I heard that person got a building named after them, that would be awesome, and definitely worth the 28 dollars. I can't believe Amazon started in 1994 agent_1:For sure, started as a book store. The USPS has a contract to deliver Amazon packages on Sunday. You think Amazon is getting too big? agent_2:I think Amazon has gotten so big, but I think in a good way. I just hope they turn into a monopoly. agent_1:For sure, they kind of already are. Or at least selling all that cheap stuff kind of hurts the market overall. The warehouse workers work a ton, between 7 and 15 miles a day they walk. agent_2:I couldn't imagine walking that much per day. I would be in the best shape of my life. Did you know that amazon has another site that sells their returned goods at a discount agent_1:I was not aware of that, what it is called? Amazon owns IMDB too, that's surprising. agent_2:I don't know what it is called, I want to check it out lol. I don't mind getting an even bigger discount on amazon goods. I wonder why the own imdb agent_1:Yah, it's just out of box stuff usually. Did you know there are no snakes in New Zealand? agent_2:New Zealand sounds like the place to be, snakes scare me lol. I don't get why some snakes give birth and some lay eggs agent_1:Yah, they're pretty messed up, it is interesting to know that the fear of snakes is engrained in our brains. agent_2:snakes are crazy lol agent_1:Truly, very crazy. I'm surprised Crocodiles are more closely related to bird than snakes and lizards. agent_2:I would never have guessed that.

Not enough to be hugely educated in it though lol I know Jupiter's storms can be heard on an Am radio though!  Never actually listened to it.  agent_1:Do you believe that life exists outside of Earth? I'm on the fence, but I've heard that astronomers have some evidence of life 455 light-years away. agent_2:Yes,  I think so.  Its just weird that out of all those planets and space and galaxies that we are the only planet with life.  agent_1:I agree. Sometimes I just look at the moon at night and think about how small we all are compared to what else is out there! agent_2:I know right,  just thinking about space and everything out there is very humbling.

It's never too late I guess. agent_1:Well said! I would love to hear it sometime haha. The Dark Side of the Moon was still one of the top albums in 2014, 40 years after release! agent_2:That's pretty awesome!

Did you know Elmo testified before congress? agent_1:No, was it a joke or for real?  agent_2:Im not totally sure, but I know he is the only non-human to do so.  Maybe Oscar the grouch was causing some problems down in the hood or something.  lol agent_1:LOL, I wonder what actor played him?  agent_2:I dont know, I always just imagine a stuffed toy or something.  The Congress always plays a Rep vs Dem game of baseball each year. agent_1:Yeah, that is fairly common. It must be a very boring game to watch though.  agent_2:I agree.  I imagine they can't be any good, which could make it funny, but in a very sad sense. agent_1:Yeah. Maybe they can put Elmo in!

I wonder what types of books the FDA burned back then. agent_2:Wow, they really did a big act of censorship, it was six tons of books agent_1:That is one big stack of books! I wish I could have watched the olympic events of literature back in the day! agent_2:That is right along with music and painting!! And it was until last centuries!! agent_1:That is so crazy! I didn't even know romantic kissing was a fairly recent development in literature! Where have I been! agent_2:Wow, And it was not mentioned frequently in greek literature agent_1:Those stories were still amazing though even without that haha. I wonder if they ever wrote about humans losing their body hair 240,000 years ago? agent_2:LOL who knows!! but I found crazy that there is  a contest to come up with the worst opening sentence of a novel agent_1:I'm sure there have been many dandies! I bet Winston Churchill wasn't in that since he won a nobel prize in literature. agent_2:Yes he did not earn a peace nobel prize! agent_1:You would have thought that is what it was for! I sometimes wonder what sound frequency causes fear in us? agent_2:Wow, I guess they use those frequencies in suspense and terror movies! but did you know we could re-grow a rib agent_1:That is crazy that we can! I wish we could regrow hair lol, and vitamin C but we can't, but everything else can! agent_2:That would be awesome! The rib we could grow in 2 to 3 months, there must be something to regrow hair, we just have to discover it! agent_1:I agree! We need to get on the immortal life like a breed of jellyfish is! agent_2:That is amazing! and about sea creatures, did you know only the seahorse has a neck? agent_1:That is hard to imagine with all of the breeds out there, but very cool!

Directed by the coens? agent_2:No, I think I didnt watch that one, who is Coens?  agent_1:theyre brothers that direct movies together, but anyway the soundtrack is good it was certified platinum 8 times agent_2:It was pretty good, scary as well, I think the soundtrack is one of the most important factors for the success of the movie agent_1:oh ya definitely, do you like Phil collins btw? agent_2:I do like him, he recorded the sountrack for Tarzan right?	agent_1:ya he did, in like 5 different foreign languages too, that's impressive!	agent_2 likes language. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['language', 'movie', 'classic'].

It's too bad we can't replicate those scents and be reminded of our childhood all of the time. agent_2:I've never thought about it, but I suppose we don't have names for smells, just where it comes from. agent_1:That's true I refer to a damp basement smell as moldy but why not refer to the smell of onions as 'yuk'? agent_2:It's difficult to imagine having names for each smell, as we have for colors.  I'd think there were too many. agent_1:Yes, but imagine if the defining term could relate to the listener not only what the smell was precisely but perhaps even it's location. Maybe other languages allow for more descriptive labels. agent_2:I suppose if you have to survive, partially because of your nose, it makes sense to be very specific.	agent_1:I would think so. I suppose it has validity to convey something with just one word that lets everyone know everything about it. I think it might be difficult if you were to use a smell word with someone who had never smelled that scent before.	agent_2 dislikes scents. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['scents', 'hobby', 'favorite hobby'].

I just saw that Carol Burnett was the first celebrity to appear on the childrens series sesame street agent_2:That is quite a bit different than American fantasy drama series Game of Thrones! agent_1:ethiopia has a celebrity tv chef who believes he can combat his country's hunger problems by encouraging everyone to eat more diverse foods agent_2:Perhaps he could join the cast of Game of Thrones, since they film in Croatia, Malta and all over the world! agent_1:I just saw that Charlie Chaplins granddaughter plays talisa maegry in game of thrones agent_2:Interesting.     Harry Lloyd is also a famous descendant, the great-great-great grandson of charles dickens. agent_1:some famous people.  did you know that there is a Nat Geo wild show called games of lions that follows the lives of lions like the game of thrones characters agent_2:Wow.     I wonder if Ireland helps finance that like they do the actual show! agent_1:Good question.  I saw that Arya is the fastest rising new baby name given to girls in the US most likely due to game of thrones agent_2:People like celebrities, real and fictional - almost as much as horses or Equus Ferus!	agent_1:Icelandic horses have a fifth speed, tolt, that is basically speedwalking for a horse	agent_2 likes hobby. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobby', 'favorite artist', 'Harry Lloyd'].

Did you hear about the satellite lost on mars? agent_1:yes that was typical of us companies to use the wrong system of measurement. nobody uses imperial except maybe beer makers. maybe the guys were talking about beer? LOL agent_2:Quite possible.  Or distracted by the selfies they were posting to facebook.  Here's me and the rover!  :)	agent_1:boy, those selfies on mars are really a distraction. i guess the IT guys on mars are never going to hear the end of the problems with the net, since the Cloud is back on earth.	agent_2 dislikes Mars. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['Mars', 'space', 'planetary project'].
4503	agent_1:hey there what do you think of planet earth? agent_2:It's a nice place. I've lived there my whole life. I'm pretty attached.

Can seem to protect things that we need to survive. And we've been here just a short time. agent_1:thats true, if history were a 24 hour day, humans have only taken up about 1 minute of time agent_2:The day has been getting longer. It was only 5.5 hours. Soon it'll be so long that we'll have a 20-hour workday. I bet people will want more vacation.  agent_1:that is wacky, will the day continue to get longer? like a 40 hour day at somepoint? agent_2:Maybe in billions of years. Humanity will be long gone, having cut down all the forests and filled the oceans with plastic. agent_1:ya that is sad to think about, also sad we'll have run out of helium by the year 2100 agent_2:We'll get our helium from fusion reactors. Every kid can have party balloons. agent_1:haha well I hope so. It's pretty silly there is an ambassador to extraterrestrials at the UN, I want his job agent_2:I think you have to know somebody. It sounds like it involves few duties. Mostly waiting. agent_1:haha ya, lots of waiting and doing nothihng, have you ever ridden a horse agent_2:Nope, never ridden a horse. Haven't eaten one either. agent_1:haha nope I have ridden one, I guess they evolved over like 50 million years agent_2:They went from multi-toed to single-toed. I guess they were more useful to humans that way. agent_1:ya I think so, they became really widespread about 3000BC, so kind of a long time agent_2:Interspecies utility is interesting. Dalmatians are associated with firefighting because they would calm  the horses. agent_1:that's nice of them. did you knw clint eastwood was allergic to horses? agent_2:Yeah, he acquired an allergy later in life.

Freddie mercury used the same piano to record bohemian rhapsody as paul mccartney used to record hey jude agent_2:cool! ever hears of Eurovision? agent_1:No, what's that? agent_2: Song Contest in england. agent_1:Oh ok.  In 2006 a group of climbers reached the top of britain's highest mountain and found a piano agent_2:neat! apparently the competition away from its usual reliance on over-the-top spectacle. agent_1:An aluminum grand piano was built for the lounge of the airship hindenburg. it weighed only 356 pounds. agent_2:Wow!

DO you like Jazz? agent_1:No, not really.  You? agent_2:Some, but Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans. agent_1:There is a programming language in which the programs are written in musical composition, and functional programs have jazz-like harmonies. agent_2:I had no idea! Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, agent_1:A harlem woman has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every sunday for 20 years. top performers occasionally stop by. agent_2:Thats neat! New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation. agent_1:Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts. agent_2:Clint eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast, pianist, and scored several films, including million dollar baby. agent_1:Clint Eastwood movies are awesome agent_2:they are/ I like grand Torino especially. what is your fave? agent_1:That's great one.

Not like Elvis. Was Johnny a friend of Nic Cage? agent_1:He might be I am not sure. He even adopted the one eyed horse that was in the movie saleepy hollow agent_2:A one-eyed horse? That sounds odd. What is so charming about Cyclops the Horse? I guess you would have to put an eyepatch over one of the eyes. agent_1:They were going to put the horse down so he wanted to save it agent_2:I guess he had a place for keeping horses. Do you know much about government? I am not a fan of government.

Bradley Cooper did a wonderful job playing the part. agent_1:What did you think of the drugs and alcohol in the opening scene agent_2:I thought that it was a great way to catch viewers attention and it also set the stage for what was to come.  agent_1:What did you think of Lady Gaga in it? This was her first major picture agent_2:Lady Gaga did well. When she went onstage for the first performance, her voice was hard to ignore. agent_1:She does have an amazing voice. I really felt like their chemistry was good for this film as well agent_2:It was. It seemed like she was learning from him. Did you think that there were any choppy patches during the film? agent_1:I felt like her own backstory was rushed and not put together well agent_2:Lady Gaga's real name is Stefani, I did not know that. agent_1:Oh I did! I am quite a fan of her actually I love her poker face song and her crazy artistic clothing agent_2:She is definitely an artist of her own.

She really does love her fans though!  agent_2:She was also on MTV's show ""boiling points"" before she was famous, I think that is interesting.  agent_1:Wow what is that I have never even heard of it! You seem to know a lot of personal knowledge about her! that is awesome agent_2:It would be awesome if they somehow did a sequel to the movie. agent_1:I do not think that will happen. I am not sure how they could progress the story into that. What do you think it would look like? agent_2:I don't know what it would look like. I just liked the movie so much. Bradly Cooper played the part of a ""washed up"" boy so hard, which I thought would be challenging for him. agent_1:I know! He is so clean cut in real life that his ability to fill that roll caught me off guard! agent_2:I often wonder if there is truth behind stars having to take pills or alcohol to make it through a concert like in the movie. agent_1:I think a lot of rock stars become overwhelmed with the fame. I can't imagine it is easy to have no privacy and so much demand on a person so I think it does happen a lot agent_2:It is not all that it is cracked up to be. agent_1:Yeah I think it is a harder life then people imagine agent_2:It is good that they show on the big screen that not even stars have a perfect life. agent_1:I agree it helps people see the truth agent_2:The grass is not always greener."	agent_1:SO what else did you like about	agent_2 likes TV shows. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV shows', 'movie', 'actor'].

Well, maybe I used to. agent_1:There is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans! That seems weird... agent_2:I think it's 13 hertz, very low, below our threshold of hearing. Causes fear because I think it's like an earthquake sound. agent_1:Reallly??? That's impressive knowledge!

I know if you smoke them with BBQ sauce for 2 hours on 180 they are delicious... agent_2:That a good tip, but they probably won't heal well after that.  agent_1:No, I am not good for the healing portion of ribs. I am on the other side of the healing line. I wonder how many ribs a black swallower fish can eat... agent_2:Times times their weight? They would get kicked out of the smorgasbord. agent_1:Yeah!

Manned space stations orbit Jupiter are impossible due to the intense radiation. agent_1:I would imagine.  I have heard there are pretty violent storms on Jupiter. agent_2:I've heard that too.

What a crazy idea to get people to play video games? agent_2:Video gaming wasn't as big then! I remeber my kids playing mortal kombat. Do you know that why they started rating video games? agent_1:Mortal combat is why they started rating video games? That seems like a benign game though. agent_2:It does now, but when it first came out? It seemed really violent. Australia probably banned it! agent_1:South Koreans 16 & under cannot play video games past midnight. Seems agist! agent_2:I think they want them to concentrate on getting some sleep! Video games make more money then films do! agent_1:That seems odd but I guess if you add in things like facebook games, that makes sense. agent_2:and the price doesn't seem to go down for video games like it does for movies. Is there any soundtrack from a video game you like? agent_1:Not really. I cant even think of a soundtrack for a video game. Is that a thing? agent_2:It is! My guys like Mach the knife from some game.

Have you ever typed askew into Google? agent_1:No I have. What does the results turn? agent_2:You should try it! It tilts the page. Another fun thing Google does is call new employees nogglers. They have to wear propeller beanies. Or is this mean? agent_1:Oh, not sure about that really. People say it is a great place to work at though agent_2:Before Google launched gmail, that was the name of a free email service offered by garfield's website. That actually seems more fun. agent_1:I know now everytime I open gmail I think of garfield agent_2:Speaking of cats, I would love to get a glow in the dark one.

AZ agent_2:It seems like she and Kanye West have perpetual conflicts of one sort or the other.  First he crashed her award acceptance.  Then she is accused of stealing his music.  Social media was not kind to her over that accusation! agent_1:I think they were a bit unfair to her, it must be hard to be a celebrity, specially a really famous one like her agent_2:Well, they called her a ""snake"".  I like the way she turned it into a positive in her concert with imagery, a snake microphone, and a snake platform.  Snakes in general have an unwarranted bad reputation.  Do you have any experience with snakes? agent_1:No not really, but I love them many people are scared of them but I think they are interesting animals agent_2:I live in a rural area, so snakes are not uncommon.  I have a 4-5 foot common garter snake nesting at the base of my fig trees.  I like there because she eats the field mice and other critters who want my figs.  Too many people automatically assume snakes are poisonous.  Did you know that only in Australia do venomous snakes outnumber non-venomous ones? agent_1:I didnt know that about Australia, are you afraid of snakes? with what you told me previously I bet you are not afraid of them agent_2:No.  I let them go on their way and I go one mine.  While we do have coral snakes, water moccasins, rattle snakes, I have never been bitten.  Did you know that one man has been bitten so often that the antigens in his blood allow it to be used an anti-venom? agent_1:Really? I guess he made a valuable contribution to science and also to medicine, did you hear of that species of flying snakes agent_2:I had not, but I could see it possible to approximate flying.  I know they can climb trees because I see the garter snake in my fig trees.  I guess if she wanted to, she could coil and spring, flinging herself from one tree to another.  Down here, Mardi Gras ended last night.   My ears are still ringing from the concerts put on by local bands.  Did you know that a Fighter Concert was so loud that it was picked up on New Zealand seismic (earthquake) monitors? agent_1:I didnt know that, do you have any favorite bands? used to like Linking Park agent_2:When I lived in Viginia, I liked Dave Matthews when he was starting out in Charlottesville.  Did you know that a woman driving to a Dave Matthews concert picked up a stranded bicyclist who was Dave Matthews himself! agent_1:Wow, that is amazing, I mean what are the ods, that woman is really lucky, I bet she went crazy in that moment. agent_2:I would think so.  I have not been to an major act indoor concert since my high school and college days in the 1970s and the 1980s.  Back then Deep Purple broke the record for the loudest concert ever that rendered 3 people unconscious.  While rendering 3 people unconscious is alarming, I wonder how many people had lifelong hearing damage after that one? agent_1:I bet at least a few of them did, a really bad concert was the one the band Creed gave in 2002, the concert was so bad the band even got sued by some of the concert goers agent_2:Well, Creed survived that one to become a major rock act in the early 2000s.  Do you know if Taylor Swift is still on the ""Reputation"" concert tour or has that wrapped up? agent_1:I guess its all wrapped up by now, I think this article is a bit old, I think that tour happened around 2016 so yeah. agent_2:I glad her reputation survived from the Kanye West feud.  While I not much of a fan of her current music, she is a talented artist.  She also is quite a philanthropist.  Did you know she donated all proceeds from ""Wildest Dream"" song to African wildlife conservation?"	agent_1:No, I didn't know about that, seems like she has a great great, I will follow her example from now on, anyways it's been cool to chat, thanks for all the facts and knowledge	agent_2 dislikes social media. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['social media', 'music', 'concert'].

Do you watch Disney Channel? agent_1:I do like the Disney Channel yeah, why do you ask? agent_2:Do you know they don't accept outside ads.  The only commercials it airs are for its own shows and Disney products? agent_1:It seems like they are loosing a lot of money there, did you watch the movie Big Hero 6? agent_2:I don't think so.  Yes, I loved Big Hero 6, so did my kids.  Speaking of Disney, did you know Walt Disney was fired from his job at a local newspaper for not being creative enough? agent_1:Well the movie Big Hero 6 was made with a 55000 core super computer, amazing right? and he was fired wow, that is funny and ironic agent_2:Amazing, what a computer that was.  Did you know that Walt Disney and Salvadore Dali collaborated on a short film? agent_1:I didnt, no, I might have to Google that later, do you know Bill Nye the science guy? agent_2:Yes, I've watched him many times on tv. agent_1:And what about the movie Flubber, do you remember that movie? agent_2:Yes, I do.

Are you explain about baseball. agent_1:Well, baseball is a really fun sport between two teams, the offensive , who are the batters and the defensive who are in the field. agent_2:oh...very nice explanation.  agent_1:Then the batter team, once they get to hit the ball, they run the bases and If they complete the bases, they score a run agent_2:wow...very interesting game. I will try to play baseball. agent_1:Yes, i agree is a lot of fun to play baseball and also to watch the world series! agent_2:ok... That game was really fun... I am also watch the baseball world series. agent_1:it is exciting because it consists of a seven game playoff, so it is not just one night, you get to extend the enjoyment many nights	agent_2:oh...

How about you? agent_2:Yeah I am the same way, I haven't been for a few years but used to go all the time.  What would you say is your favorite ever? agent_1:I would have to say Pink Floyd, or Linkin Park, there is so many!  agent_2:That is awesome, I am a big Pink Floyd fan, well I kinda am, of their first album.  But any concert that they ever played would be really cool to attend.  agent_1:Yes, they have the best shows that I have seen. Aerosmith puts on a great concert too. agent_2:That sounds good as well.  I really like the Apples in Stereo, they put on a good show.  Radiohead was really good as well, although I really went to see the opening band, thats sad but true.  agent_1:I love Radihead, who was the opening band at that concert? agent_2:Yeah they are awesome, and I wasn't aware of how little they toured!  But I really wanted to see Steve Malkmus and the Jicks.  agent_1:Oh wow, I haven't heard of them. I hope you enjoyed that concert though!  agent_2:Yeah it was really good, I was in high school, I remember my friend and I went together, it was awesome. Alpine Valley in Wisconsin.  agent_1:Cool! I have enjoyed every concert I have ever been to. I heard that there was a lawsuit against the band Creed for the show being so bad lol....I wonder how that worked out. agent_2:Yeah that is so lame to me.  If you don't like it, then you learn your lesson and don't buy any more tickets to any more concerts.  agent_1:Exactly! So do you ever go vote in the elections at all? Pretty sad John Mccain passed away but he went through a lot, so many people died in 2018.  agent_2:Yeah there were a lot of good people who died this past year.  And yeah I do, did you know the voter turnout for US presidential elections hasn't gone over 62% in the last 100 years!? agent_1:Really? That's it? more people need to get in to these elections because every vote counts! agent_2:Yeah isn't that crazy, that seems way to low to even be true but it is.  agent_1:Kind of sad really. I also heard that Michael Trister, civil rights lawyer died, a few people that did a lot of good have been passing lately.  agent_2:Yeah that is sad as well.  Here is a really weird fact, did you know that just under the last 120 years, the taller presidential candidate has won 75% of the time?  Better start making that bet in vegas! agent_1:Really? Haha, that's odd! I have a funny fact...John McCains mom....took race car driving classes and she is in her 90s!  agent_2:That is super funny! I wonder what the fastest she ever drove was, legally or illegally?  agent_1:I don't know how fast she went but being in her 90s she must have wanted to drive a race car really bad lol...no time like the present!     It has been great chatting!	agent_2:Yeah right, and yeah same here, I hope you have a good night. 	agent_1 likes goodbye. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['goodbye', 'music', 'concert'].

Do you know Linkin Park? agent_2:I've heard the name. They're a band, right? agent_1:Yes a famous one . They held 324 concerts in 2001 agent_2:They must not have slept. I guess it's good to be young! agent_1:Yeah I guess so. How about Ramones, do you know them? agent_2:The Ramones are legendary, but I've never seen them live. agent_1:They have played concerts for 20 years straight agent_2:I guess they love touring! I would get exhausted! agent_1:Yeah me too, so many concerts though, 2263 of them agent_2:I wonder if anyone follows the band around. Pink Floyd recorded a concert in an empty amphitheater. What is that about?	agent_1:Yeah I wonder too.

13508	"agent_1:Hi! Do you play video games? Did you know that it's illegal in South Korea for kids under 16 to play video games? I wonder how kids in America would take that, if that became a law here, haha.  agent_2:oh wow, that is weird I don't like that, I played lots of games as a kid what about you? agent_1:I know, I agree with you! yes, i till play from time to time I enjoy a good solo game of zombies, it gets my heart racing. Video games were initially called cathode ray tube amusement devices which were used by the military, another fun fact for ya.  agent_2:that is fun! kind of sad that humans as a whole play games for 3 billion hours a week agent_1:This is true! and I'm sure as video games progress and evolve we will lose touch of reality, what is reality anyway? Another cool game out there ""Little Big Planet"" was narrated by Stephen Fry. He also narrated hitchhiker guide to the galaxy and harry potter video games. Little Big Planet though is a fun Family game. agent_2:ah thats cool, I do like that game, did you ever play a toy story game? Tom Hanks brother does all the voices actually agent_1:No I have not, some theorists categorize video games as a form of art, but this designation is controversial. I was a hardcore Nintendo Super Mario girl. I still Love that game. agent_2:haha that game is amazing and I agree they are an art form! do you watch any judge judy btw agent_1:agreed, and Yes I have, I hear she makes about 123,000 an episode! yes, please! She makes almost as much as Lebron. agent_2:thats nuts! yup the second highest paid celebrity, I wonder how much Robin Williams made for doing the genie in aladdin agent_1:Im not sure, but surely a heck of a lot, he was a famous celebrity by then. He was probably one of the few to be able to enter Pixar's studio secret room. agent_2:haha ya I agree, did you watch Sesame street as a kid? I never knew the first celebrity on the show was Carol Burnett agent_1:Interesting! well you know, celebrity status is often associated with wealth and PERKS!

11335	agent_1:Hello, my good friend! How are you doing today on this fine fine day? agent_2:Hi very good thanks. It is interesting learning about the Republican party back in the 1800's! agent_1:The Republican party has deep roots, it has a long history, but it has changed. Now we are down to just two parties. It is not good. agent_2:Yeah I agree. Since 1853 there has been no president other than republican or democrats. agent_1:I think that the red/blue division has made politics unsatisfying for many voters. They want other options but there are none. agent_2:True. That whole categorization didn't start until 2000 surprisingly. agent_1:I think that the polarization of politics came with the Bush/Gore election. I am not happy that it has not changed. Now we need for independents.  agent_2:Yes I agree with you there. Interestingly every president with a beard has been a republican! agent_1:I think that the beard conveys wisdom, the deep wisdom that comes from age. I think that the republicans want to look like Lincoln. agent_2:Yes good point. In the pas they used animals to associate with parties. Truman took that very seriously. agent_1:I think that Truman knew that the elephant was his mortal enemy and could not be trusted. Even at Disneyland. He knew the impact of media. agent_2:True. He just didn't want to be associated with Republicans! agent_1:I think that he was smart. The Republicans were probably trying to set him up. They laid a cunning trap, but he was too smart for those  agent_2:Yeah Truman was a smart guy like you say. After the Voting Rights Act in 1965 the southern states became more reupublican. agent_1:Yes, the voting issue made many people in the South angry. They did not want the change so they went to the other party, the one with the beards. agent_2:Haha the beard party yes. Interesting that the GOP used to endorse values of classical liberalism.	agent_1:That is the odd thing about the name. It is liberalism from Europe, not the liberalism of the socialists.

I wouldn't get anything done but it would be amazing lol! Did you know dogs have 12 different blood types? agent_2:I did.  I guess I should get my dog checked for her blood type next time I see the vet.  Do you have a dog? agent_1:I will have to, yes, his name is rocky, he is my favorite pet of all time, what is your dogs name? agent_2:her name is Yuki, it means snow in Japanese,  she is a white dog lol She is a rescue so we dont know the breed,  shes a mutt.  agent_1:aww that is cute, rescue dogs tend to be the best! I want to clone my dog when he passes he is that good. They have cloned cats before, but no thanks to a cat	agent_2:lol that would be cool if you can clone your dog after they pass!

9105	agent_1:hey did you know a robot can now be programmed to debone a chicken? agent_2:Interesting. There is even a robotic arm that a paralyzed woman controls with her thoughts. agent_1:wow that is cool, do you Like Michael Jackson? He wanted to build a 50 foot robot haha agent_2:That sounds pretty wild. I think the mars robots are cute. The Curiosity sings happy birthday to itself on its birthday. agent_1:haha they are cute! did you ever watch Mythbusters? I guess they created a robot sidekick on that show agent_2:I do watch that sometimes but have not seen that episode. I guess the idea of chess playing robots have been around for awhile. Napoleon and Benjamin Franklin lost chess games to a robot, but it wasn't really a robot. A person was hidden inside.  agent_1:haha I remember hearing about that, one thing I'm glad is the US military uses xbox 360 controllers for the eod robots, thats probably cost savings agent_2:Do you worry about robots getting minds of their own? Megatron, a fictional character, was the leader of a civil rights group on Cybertron that wanted equal rights for all robots. agent_1:haha yes I would worry about that, especially now they are putting rat brains into robots, that is scary! agent_2:Really? That is strangely awesome. Have you heard of the home robot Amazon is building? I need one. agent_1:no I haven't, do you know anything about it it sounds awesome! all I know is amazon actually owns imdb, you know that movie site agent_2:Oh, interesting! They are into all types of niches. This project has been many years in the making and it's called the Vesta. We might be able to get it next year, but the robot will likely become a roving Alexa. Unfortunately, it probably won't be a housekeeper. agent_1:ah thats too bad because thats what I need! Would you work at an Amazon warehouse? I guess a worker can walk up the 15 miles a day from their shift work agent_2:I would love to work at an Amazon warehouse. I think it might get me into shape! In the future that job will probably be done by robots but for now, it's even hard to train a robot to pick up a coffee mug, a task that is incredibly easy for humans. agent_1:haha thats what I think too, and I do wish I were the first person to order on amazon, only $28 and you could have had a building named after you! agent_2:Nice! I think we will see Amazon come out with a factory floor robot sooner than one that has to adapt to a landscape that changes constantly because of dirty laundry and kids clothes. agent_1:haha that would be awesome! humans are always evolving though, maybe robots are the next thing, I mean only 200,000 years ago we still had body hair agent_2:And a lot of people do still have an awful lot of body hair. Haha. We supposedly get goosebumps because of an evolutionary trait that was used to make fur stand up and make an animal look bigger agent_1:haha that is funny, it's weird that humans lost the ability to synthesize vitamin c, our gene is defective agent_2:And we are the only mammals that cannot breathe and swallow at the same time. Bummer.	agent_1:haha imagine how cool that would be, that sucks and also sucks to be a human because there is a sound frequency that causes fear in us	agent_2 dislikes science. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['science', 'technology', 'robot'].
13749	agent_1:You a Justin Timberlake fan? Sounds like his current tour is pretty cool. agent_2:For a pop artist I don't mind JT. His Man in the Woods Tour? Which is album is that concert for? agent_1:I'm not actually sure. I will have to look that up. But he played a lot of past songs too. agent_2:Oh! I think the album is actually called Man in the Woods. I don't think it was as good as his earlier stuff. I only really remember Say Something from this new album. agent_1:Yeah. Well I think it's safe to say he has come a long way since Mickey Mouse Club! agent_2:Have you seen any of the movies he's been in? agent_1:Yeah I saw the one about facebook which I thought was good. He is a good actor but I think he should stick to pop music. Ricky Gervais was a pop singer oddly enough. agent_2:I can't remember the name of the movie I saw him but Cameron Diaz and Jason Segal were in it too. It was pretty good. I can't imagine Ricky Gervais singing at all! He's hilarious though. agent_1:Oh yeah I remember that movie too. Like a rom-com. Yes he is. I want to look up his video lol. Wonder if he played the guitar? agent_2:Haha I don't think so. His voices doesn't sound like it would translate to a singing voice at all. Although doesn't his character in The Office sing? agent_1:Haha occasionally yes but not well. I just watched the movie about queen. The guitarist, Brian May, has a phd in astrophysics. agent_2:I haven't seen that movie, but that band was incredibly talented. I heard the actor who played Freddie Mercury in it didn't sing the songs himself.	agent_1:No don't think he did. He won an oscar for it though. well deserved.

That is really interesting. agent_1:It is interesting, but something that's sad is that four-fifths of the world's natural forests have been destroyed. We need to do better with the planet I think agent_2:I think so too. I can't believe when the earth was first formed, one day was 5.5 hours long! agent_1:I know right! do you think that days are getting longer overtime? Like will we have a 40 hour day at some point in the future agent_2:I'm not sure, but I hope not, that is way too long! agent_1:What do you think about the United Nations appointing an ambassador to extraterrestrials? I wonder what he does all day, sounds like the most boring job in the world because obviously we haven't had contact yet	agent_2:It must be very boring.

I saw video games were originally called cathode ray tube amusement devices. agent_1:Say that ten times fast haha. Did you know it is illegal for kids 16 and under to play video games past midnight? agent_2:Haha. I did not know that, but maybe that's a good idea.  agent_1:I agree. Do you have a playstation or xbox? agent_2:I have a PS4. What about you? agent_1:I have an xbox. I wonder when the playstation came out? agent_2:I love Sony so I've always stuck with Playstation. agent_1:I had the playstation and playstation 2 but then jumped to xbox. I think it's cool the military uses playstation 3's to build a supercomputer. agent_2:That is very cool. They are super powerful devices so it makes sense to me. agent_1:Do you like to watch baseball at all? agent_2:I love baseball. What about you? agent_1:Same here.

I'm actually not even sure if that is true.  agent_1:Yeah, sometimes the facts that i encounter in this vicinity of the internet seem a little less than factish.  agent_2:Yup, I can't disagree there.

Or maybe they are just some weirdo?  agent_1:Yeah. ""Hey, that guy is a nutter, but we cant fire him. Alien ambassador? Yeah, he will buy that. give him that job."" agent_2:BINGO!

I saw Wikileaks once published the government's plan to shutdown Wikileaks. agent_1:that is awesome, that is really sticking it to the man. I wonder if they released why 86% of Nevada is owned by the government agent_2:That's a lot of Nevada they own.

150	"agent_1:Do you like comic books? agent_2:I do like comic books! agent_1:Have you heard that Harley Quinn has a new comic book series coming out? agent_2:I have not heard that.  I know that comic book legend Stan Lee used to end every phone conversation with ""excelsior!"" agent_1:I've heard that too. Did you know that the DC in DC comics stands for Detective Comics? agent_2:I just read that today.  The largest comic book market is in Japan.  I believe it.  My son loves to read those mangas. agent_1:I would love to go there. I used to like reading Manga too.  agent_2:The manga market is Japan is valued at $6 to $7 billion dollars! agent_1:That is wild! Did you know that Michigan State University library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world? agent_2:I didn't know that.  I wonder how many people use it.  By comparison to Japan, the US comic book market in the US and Canada is $1.09 billion! agent_1:That's crazy, Japan is way more into comic books than America it seems.  agent_2:I agree!  The Marvel cinematic universe takes place in earth -199999, a multiverse different from the original comic book multiverse, earth-616! agent_1:That's pretty wild. Marvel published a ""generic comic book,"" in order to trademark the names ""superhero"" and ""super-villain."" That was pretty smart of them.  agent_2:No doubt!

5790	agent_1:hey there what do you think of the game of baseball? agent_2:Baseball is ok. I remember hearing my older relatives calling the World Series the Fall Classic. It sounds very retro. agent_1:haha that is retro, I never knew that baseball managers could start playing if they wanted to, and thats why they wear uniforms agent_2:Yes I just recently learned that, too, and thought it was very interesting! It might be like an embarrassment to the team to have to bring in a manager like that, though. What do you think? agent_1:haha ya I would think so, can you believe that baseball is super popular in Japan, I had no idea agent_2:Yea, when I worked for Target a few years ago I remember they'd have Japanese baseball on in the break room along with other TV's with American Sports. agent_1:ah that is interesting, I wish I was like the guy who found millions of dollars of baseball cards in his attic, now that would be a surprise agent_2:As long as I'm not like the guy found in a beer cooler behind a concession stand at a baseball stadium. He was found just before a braves game, too. agent_1:ya I heard about that that was crazy, did you ever play kickball as a kid? I guess it's called soccer-baseball in canada agent_2:Canadians do have some different ways about them. Soccer-baseball does sound hilarious. So does poutine, though. agent_1:haha well I do like poutine, but I think that yes soccer-baseball sounds incredibly dumb haha	agent_2:I wonder if they have poutine at American baseball games?

That was a scary movie back in the day. agent_2:Yeah, that was a good movie. Did you like it?  agent_1:I use to. I think I have seen it too many times now. Spielberg played the clarinet for the soundtrack. agent_2:Yeah, that is pretty interesting. Did you see the Goonies?  agent_1:I have. That is a cute movie. I love how they get the jewels at the end to pay the mortgage. agent_2:It is pretty good. I'm fairly certain Stranger Things is a rip off of it.  agent_1:I've never seen that movie. There are so many rip-offs these days. agent_2:It is a show on Netflix actually. The first season isn't that bad.  agent_1:I don't have Netflix. These days, I'm sure that sounds weird. agent_2:I don't either. I saw it at a friends house.  agent_1:I heard that Netflix is losing a lot of money because of password sharing. Did you know Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office star? I would believe it. agent_2:Yeah, that could be, they are creating a lot of their own content.  agent_1:All the streaming channels seem to be doing that now.	agent_2:Yeah, that is pretty cool.

327	"agent_1:hey hows it going, do you know what the first cloned animal was? agent_2:Was it a sheep? I heard the first cloned pet was a cat, though. Its name was copy cat. That is funny! agent_1:haha ya I like that, what is also wild to me is that there are more domesticated tigers living as pets than there are wild tigers living around asia agent_2:Wow, that is weird and sad. Speaking of which, did you hear about the tiger found in the duffel bag? agent_1:no that is really sad, poor tiger what happened to it? Why was it in a bag? agent_2:I guess it was being smuggled to the USA from Mexico. agent_1:ya I don't like that that makes me mad, do you have any pets? I guess In Japan there are more pets than there are kids under the age of fifteen agent_2:They really love their pets huh? No, I don't have any pets. Do you? agent_1:no we used to have a dog but we were only watching her for a bit and the owner took her away, we had lots of pets as kids though like iguanas and rabbits and such agent_2:In Boulder, Colorado you cannot own a pet. You can be their guardian though. agent_1:hmm that seems dumb like its just playing with words, do you like Teddy Roosevelt? apparently he had over 20 pets, or as they say in Colorado, ""Guardians"" haha agent_2:Maybe it helps people to feel more of an obligation to their pets. Shrug. Yeah, Teddy Roosevelt is an interesting guy. It's unfortunate though that people try to domesticate tigers as you mentioned. Many of the animals perish along the way from suffocation or hunger.  agent_1:ya that makes me really sad, what do you think about fish? I had salmon for dinner so I do think theyre tasty haha agent_2:Haha. Funny. I don't eat seafood. My mom forced me to eat salmon way too often when I was little and I grew sick of it.

173	agent_1:Can you believe there is stars that can be cold enough to be touched ? The universe is so diverse.  agent_2:Its amazing and ever evolving.  agent_1:Yeah and there is even places that exist but we never will be able to see because they are too far away.  agent_2:They are saying space pulls galaxies outside of universe that we could see agent_1:Yes that is what I was saying, albeit I doubt that there is only one electron in the universe like some people say.  agent_2:I don't see anything supporting or denying that theory so we would never know for sure.  agent_1:Yeah, but only one ? For all the universe ? It does not seems logic ... agent_2:There is only one sun that warms earth and all other planets so why not just one electron?  agent_1:Because an electron is part of matter, the water you drink, the chair you sit on. Saying there is only 1 electron in the universe is like saying there is 1 grain of wheat in your bread.   agent_2:It makes sense when you put it that way but in terms of that universe size the electron could be very big. agent_1:Maybe they did mean to say that our universe is contained in an electron in another universe ? agent_2:I don't know but I am at the end of knowledge on this subject. What do you think about the facts of comics? I would have thought US invented them, but it's Japan or UK. agent_1:Japan has a great printing history, I am not surprised about this. Do you read comics books ? I have read a few but not about super-heroes.  agent_2:I used to in my childhood but not any more, I used to love inspector Gadget.  agent_1:Was Inspect Gadget a comics on Paper or a cartoon on TV ? I was talking about what Marvel is publishing. agent_2:On Paper and yes I do recall seeing Super-hero and Hulk books. agent_1:I think that Hulk is in the Marvel universe.

Humans only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds if the entire earths history was viewed as 1 day!	agent_1:Wow that is hard to believe.

391	agent_1:Good Morning! How are you today? agent_2:Well, you may be on the other side of the fence but I like neither Kanye nor Trump. agent_1:I couldn't have said it any better lol. That was such an odd meeting between them two a couple months ago! agent_2:I recall the time that Kanye stood up to a President when he perceived racism, now he seems to have flipped.  I guess they money makes a big difference, agent_1:A very big difference. He even thinks AIDS is a man-made disease! agent_2:People love a good conspiracy story.  I think that is how Trump does so well, people believe in the Deep State, and such. agent_1:I agree! What kind of music do you like to listen to? agent_2:I'm a kid of the eighties and nineties,  I never really moved on from that alternative rock scene. agent_1:Same here! I think rap has been a major significance in the last twenty years though huh? agent_2:There has been the odd rap song that I like, but for me it's cultural.  I'm just not from the environment most rappers are and can't appreciate their point of view. agent_1:I agree too! I can't believe a michigan judge once delivered her ruling to eminem in the form of a rap haha. agent_2:That's kind of cool, I like it when people don't take themselves too seriously.  Like when Kanye made fun of himself on SNL.  If only he'd do it more. agent_1:All he has to do is talk and it happens haha. I give him props though, he once gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair at a concert. However, I'm sure he told a person to stand up in a wheelchair before too..... agent_2:Funny.  Are you one for hats?  Probably not a MAGA hat, but hat's in general?  agent_1:I wear hats when I'm out hiking, but that is about it, how about you? agent_2:Generally not.  I'm originally from the UK so I guess most people would associate me with a bowler hat, but never really worn any type of hat. agent_1:It took me awhile to figure out what it looks like but now I know. Wasn't that the most popular hat in the old west too? agent_2:I'm guessing that is because of TV and movies, we get this idea of the way it is shown when reality is somewhat different. Being self deprecating, I'd say a dunces cap suits me well.	agent_1:Well said! I think it suits me well too haha.

I wonder what types of books the FDA burned back then. agent_2:Wow, they really did a big act of censorship, it was six tons of books agent_1:That is one big stack of books! I wish I could have watched the olympic events of literature back in the day! agent_2:That is right along with music and painting!! And it was until last centuries!! agent_1:That is so crazy! I didn't even know romantic kissing was a fairly recent development in literature! Where have I been! agent_2:Wow, And it was not mentioned frequently in greek literature agent_1:Those stories were still amazing though even without that haha. I wonder if they ever wrote about humans losing their body hair 240,000 years ago? agent_2:LOL who knows!! but I found crazy that there is  a contest to come up with the worst opening sentence of a novel	agent_1:I'm sure there have been many dandies!

4832	"agent_1:Do you like fish? agent_2:Yes, I love fish (at least eating it). I find it funny that freshwater fish only ""drink"" water through their skin via osmosis, while saltwater fish also drink water through their mouths. agent_1:I like to eat them too, and that is funny, have you heard of the black swallower fish before? agent_2:Well, I've heard that they can eat prey twice their length and ten times their weight, so they must be quite strong.  agent_1:I agree and also a scary species, they seem like quite the predator agent_2:Yeah, for sure! I also found it interesting that a seahorse is the only fish to have a neck. I didn't even know it was a kind of fish. agent_1:The only one? reallly? that is suprising I though most fish had a neck agent_2:Actually, I think what we take for a fish's neck (I've made this mistake also) is not really a neck, but more the area where their gills come out. I find it interesting also that 84 per cent of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish. agent_1:Sounds like a fish we have to study a lot more closely, they can be the solution to many of our health problems and the immortal jellyfish agent_2:Yeah, for sure! It's kind of funny actually, because they said that in humans, that if a human has a rib surgically shortened, that he/she can regrow a rib equally as strong as the original within only 2-3 months. agent_1:Humans are just amazing, we adapt for persistnace and we are the best distance runners in all the animal kingdom agent_2:Yeah, for sure! Humans do have their downfalls though, because they cannot synthesize their own vitamin c like animals and plants can. agent_1:I guess its a great thing we know how to appy science,  agent_2:Yeah, for sure! One thing that humans have going for them however is their creativity. Did you know that there is an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel? That's really funny.  agent_1:I didnt know that, do you like to read? it does sound like a funny contest"	agent_2:Yes, I love reading. It's kind of funny, because architecture, literature, music, painting and sculptures were olympic events from 1912 until 1952.

For me personally it can't get here soon enough. But whatever happens we will get by! I was reading about the talks about how George Hathaway, has a book about the Alt-Right, pretty interesting.  agent_1:Yeah. I am fearful of those groups normalizing hate speech, sorry if you're alt-right... agent_2:I am definitely not Alt-Right, these groups are scary to me. All the extremist groups are very scary. A man named Tenold wrote personal accounts on a personal level with these groups. Very interesting. agent_1:If I am alt-right, I do not want my name included with the KKK. However, I am not alt-roght and think they should be lumped in with them. agent_2:Everyone thinks modern day KKK is not a threat even by the Alt Right but I have to say they are in my opinion. They have committed hate crimes just as much as the other groups.  agent_1:I agree. I think their speech is just as dangerous. It tells others that hate speech is allowable and endorsed by people like the president. 	agent_2:Exactly, couldn't agree more. Our country is so crazy and the books these men are writing prove to be a bit scary on much hate they have seen and heard.

Even the ramones who toured for 20 years only played like 100 per year agent_2:Yea that's pretty amazing. I love Linkin Park.  agent_1:Also that is almost one every day. Must have been incredibly taxing agent_2:I bet. In Croatia there is an ancient amphitheater that is still in use as a venue today. agent_1:Isn't there also one in pompeii? I believe pink floyd performed there agent_2:Yes, I've seen the Pink Floyd performance in Pompeii.  agent_1:Do you mean the recording? I believe that had no audience on site agent_2:Yes, I saw the recording of it.  agent_1:Did you like it? agent_2:Yea it was pretty good. Do you like poetry? agent_1:I enjoy my fair share. There are many different types of poetry though agent_2:Yes there is a lot. There is a poem when read normally is depressing, but when read backwards, is inspiring. agent_1:That in itself is inspiring. Much like saying there is two sides to every story agent_2:Yep.

I hope not though. agent_1:Soon we will run out of helium. Earth will be virtually helium-free by the end of the 21st century. Where will it all go? agent_2:I know, where? Interesting when the earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long! agent_1:Now it's longer and getting even longer. Soon the workday will be 20 hours. I will retire then. agent_2:lol, good idea!! We have a time change on the 10th of March! agent_1:I totally forgot. I guess that I will lose an hour of sleep. Doh.  agent_2:Yeah, spring forward.  Do you like superhero's like Wonder woman? agent_1:I like Wonder Woman. I did not see the recent film. I heard it was good. agent_2:I didn't either, Gal Gadot was unaware she was auditioning for wonder woman, she thought it was for cat woman! agent_1:That's great! She looks like Wonder Woman. She is in great shape and has the look.  agent_2:I think so. She's perfect for the part! I do like cat woman though too! agent_1:She would do well in that too. When wonder woman first appeared as a member of the justice society in 1941, the group made her their secretary. That is pretty sexist! But typical for the day. agent_2:I was thinking the same thing! In 1953 Winston Churchill won a Nobel prize in literature.	agent_1:I guess he was good at telling stories. I never knew that. He was quite a leader.

I wonder if Netflix and Blockbuster ever could have done a partnership or something like that. agent_1:Well Blockbuster had the chance to buy it and passed on it. bad decision agent_2:Definitely a terrible decision, now Netflix has all these great selections. Last I checked they have almost 150 movies with perfect ratings on Rotten Tomatoes. agent_1:Yesh for sure, and they offerd it to blockbuster for only $50 million agent_2:That would have been a steal for sure. I wonder how much Netflix pays their taggers, who have to watch and label the content. agent_1:Hmm good question. Do you know how netflix came about? agent_2:I believe they started off with DVD sales and rentals, and eventually transitioned into streaming media. I wonder how they improve technology from here. agent_1:Yeah and then the owner of netflix was fine $40 for a late fee and got sick of it agent_2:It's interesting how people get inspiration for things. IMDb is actually older than the first web browsers on the internet. agent_1:That is truly very cool. Did you know netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in north america? agent_2:I never knew that! I wonder if it's similar for other TV/movie platforms.

Well, maybe I used to. agent_1:There is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans! That seems weird... agent_2:I think it's 13 hertz, very low, below our threshold of hearing.

Do you like movies? agent_2:I like movies, it is a form of art. .  agent_1:This is interesting..Even though spartacus had a cinematographer, stanley kubrick took the camera away from him and did it himself.  agent_2:You have to do it yourself, he was very talented, I saw some of his films, but never Spartacus, is it good ?  agent_1:It is! But this is interesting too..even though he did almost none of the work, when spartacus got the academy award for best cinematography, it went to the credited cinematographer, and not kubrick. agent_2:Probably, some kind of union thing, like he was not an official cinematographer.  I wonder if they gave him something for it.  agent_1:Thats a good question! No woman has ever been nominated for the academy award for best cinematography. agent_2:I guess it is because there is not many female cinematographer because they would not hire them. Sexism still exist.  agent_1:That is terrible. A woman has never even been nominated. agent_2:Yeah, do you see movies made by a woman ? agent_1:I haven't paid attention to that. I'll have to now. Cinematographer roger deakins has been nominated 13 times for the best cinematography oscar, and has never won. agent_2:He was good but not enough, did he do any comedies ? I like those kind of film.  agent_1:I don't think he did. Do you like Bill murray? Bill murray thinks kung fu hustle is ""the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy"". agent_2:I like Bill Murray, Chinese comedies can be really funny. But I never saw kung fu hustle. Did you ? agent_1:no, not my type of movie! I do like Jack black though.

Did you watch 3rd rock from the sun?  agent_2:I did when I was young, it was good but not memorable, not like Seinfeld.  agent_1:3rd rock from the sun won the golden globe for best comedy series in 1997, beating seinfeld, friends, and frasier. agent_2:That is surprising and not surprising at the same time, we don't know what will stand the test of time, disco was not forever.  agent_1:True! Wow! Comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows since its creation in 1989 agent_2:You have to try new thing and not be afraid to admit your mistakes.

The most popular hat in the Old West was actually the bowler, not the Cowboy hat. agent_2:So you are saying that all of the westerns have got it wrong? Haha, all of the cowboys should have been wearing bowler hats, doesn't make them seem quite as tough.  agent_1:I guess so! I was surprised when I learned that. Imagine the Marlboro cowboy in a bowler! That wouldn't work though, because a cowboy really does need a cowboy hat to protect against the sun and rain.	agent_2:I agree, it is just not the same.

It looks like a lot of fun! agent_1:I wonder how much the headsets cost for it?  The fist virtual reality game was made in 1968.  I had no idea they were around then. agent_2:I thought I've heard that VR has been used for training soldiers, so I wonder if it could have been around for even longer than 1968, but kept secret! agent_1:Quite possible.  I read where 40 percent of users experience motion sickness in virtual reality. agent_2:Well, that part doesn't sound very fun. Did you know there is a NASA scientist who genuinely believes we're living in a reality generated by a computer? Or maybe multiple computers... agent_1:I didn't know that.  I know that Lockheed Martin has a virtual reality ""Mars bus"" that can take kids on a tour of Mars.  That would be neat. agent_2:Wow, I was excited when I heard a company was starting art buses to park in lots of shopping centers to look after kids while parents shop. I can't even imagine how great a VR Mars tour bus would be!!! agent_1:Hahaha  Do you know anyone that has the Oculus Rift VR headset that Facebook released? agent_2:I don't, but I'd love to try it. I am really interested in those augmented reality systems that area a type of VR. I had an idea for those Google glasses before they came out, even! agent_1:Nice!  Stanford's free artificial intelligence class uses Google plus hangouts to help them teach more effectively.  What do you think of AI?  It kind of scares me. lol agent_2:Meant to say augmented reality. I think it's strange how Tesler's Theorem for AI is whatever hasn't been done yet. Does that mean he wouldn't call the VR games AI? agent_1:I have no idea.  Good question.  AI has crushed all human records in the puzzle game ""2048"".

Heard of him? agent_1:Yeah I have heard of him, he has made some good songs.  Do you know what age he graduated high school? agent_2:They say age 25. I'm guessing that he may have received a GED.  He's been in show business, first, a TV series called Degrassi: The Next Generation, ever since Drake was a 14 year old. Maybe dropped out of school in about 9th grade? agent_1:Yeah what I think is that he started so young he didn't have time to finish, but eventually did a GED type program.  I'm sure he is more than smart enough.  agent_2:Absolutely. I'd say the guy found his calling in the music industry, especially rap. He's also written songs, produced albums and become a savvy entrepreneur, they say. Not just your average Next Generation kid! agent_1:No, he is not, I know he has won multiple grammys as well! agent_2:Yes, earned his 2st Grammy in 2011, and has earned more for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Album. agent_1:That is very impressive.

Chip and Joanna Gaines, a conservative evangelical couple from Texas, who did not impose their religious beliefs on TV audiences, but were clearly sincere down-home folks, took houses needed fixing and turned them into dream homes for clients. It was heartwarming, and the couple were fun-loving. agent_1:That sounds pretty entertaining, I might have to check it out when I can.  agent_2:You'll have to catch back episodes from their 5 seasons (2013 to 2018). Recently they welcomed their 5th child, and ended the show, they said, to put their family 1st again. There's a whole genre of fix-up shows, PBS, on TV today. Who knew? agent_1:Well I can respect them making that decision, I'm sure it's best for their family.  agent_2:Agreed. Sorry, I meant to say that there's a whole genre of fix-it shows, all of which stem from This Old House, now on PBS, on several networks, including HGTV, today. agent_1:Oh ok, yeah I think I have heard of some of those shows before as well.  agent_2:If you want to see more of the Gaines couples work, they're written best-selling books and have a home goods line featured at Target stores. Have a Target reasonably close to you? Do you shop there? agent_1:Yeah we do have a Target in town, I think I will check that out, thanks! agent_2:I know Target well because I witnessed their growth from one location in the Roseville Shopping Center in the suburban Twin Cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis, MN to Target becoming the 8th-largest US retail department store today.

I remember seeing the trailer where Pooh goes, ""They say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing every day!"" I thought that line was funny. agent_1:I thought it was a clever adaptation of a classic that help the now older audience reconnect and relate in order to reconnect to their youth, perhaps having imaginary pals of their own agent_2:Hmm.. sometimes I think all my pals are imaginary.  Sadly, I'm told the REAL Christopher Robin (who the books were based on) hated them and never took any money from them.  I find that sad, since his father wrote the books for him.. agent_1:That is a shame. I wonder why the real chris hated them. Perhaps he wanted a father to be there for him rather than children books agent_2:I think maybe he felt embarrassed because the books were based so heavily on his life.  Did you know he died on Easter in 1996?  That was one year after I graduated from high school.  Man, I feel old!  LOL agent_1:Well I hope he at least found some solace in that it inspired and that it is a indispensable part of many children worldwide agent_2:Yeah, hopefully.  Anyway, like I said, I haven't seen it, I think I'll check and see if my library has it though.  I would get it from Netflix, but I don't have a subscription at the moment.  Are you on Netflix?  It's pretty awesome! They've got like 137 million subscribers worldwide. agent_1:While I understand their business model and why people use it, I never got it. It is impressive nonetheless that they account for 33% of all bandwith in north america during peak hours agent_2:Yeah, I've heard they're especially busy in the late hours.  Get this, they have an hour long movie that's nothing but a roaring fireplace!  I think people play it a lot during the holidays or winter months to give their living rooms (or whatever) a decorative look. agent_1:I think that that is surprisingly practical for the ambiance. I bet blockbuster's ghost regrets not buying netflix agent_2:Ha, yeah!  I'm told they laughed the Netflix people out of the office when they made an offer to them.  They regret that decision for sure!   agent_1:I mean if I could pay 50million today for 2 billion in a few years wow what an investment agent_2:Get this, Netflix has people on it's staff who's job is to watch the shows and tag the content (guessing with genre tags and stuff.)

Lol. Did you know that nevada is the only state to have a none of these candidates option while voting?  agent_2:I guess it's nice to have that option, especially if you have one one your really don't want to vote for, for example, someone who doesn't exactly agree with history textbooks. agent_1:On a funnier note. President truman in 1957 refused to have his picture taken with dumbo because he didnt want to be associated with republicans. Lol. agent_2:Media savvy in the days before camera phone and the internet, I would categorize him as forward thinking. agent_1:H sure was. Did you know that the use of red and blue for the two major parties was not used until the year 2000. Crazy huh? agent_2:That is the kind of thing you think has been around for ever.  Maybe that is why we only have two major parties, everyone's two favorites colors are taken. agent_1:I think they should just change all of their colors to brown. During the 2012 elections international electoral observrs were blocked from the polls in nine states. agent_2:That would make me suspicious of what is going on there, why don't they want to be observed?  These are the places that end up with animals becoming mayor, or cats placing high on Senate elections. agent_1:I would say a cat would be better than some of the politicians. So have you ever played fantasy congress? agent_2:Fantasy congress sound like it is taking the whole fantasy sports thing to far.  I can't see many people sitting in bars yelling at CSPAN because their politician has made the wrong move. agent_1:No janet you were supposed to be against abortion. Lol. I v could see it as well. Sorry about that last message. I dont know what happened there. Did you know that the first woman was elected to congress in 1916. agent_2:Woman are becoming more represented, may one day the Presidential job can be their, whether she is red or blue. agent_1:I just dont understand why women couldnt vote but could be elected to congress. agent_2:Maybe it was an oversight of the rule writers, a loop hole so to speak.  Surprising that so many men would have voted for woman back in 1916. agent_1:I am surprised as well. Did you know that elmo once testified before congress? agent_2:Elmo, I'd like to have seen how they did that.   What would he have been talking about.  I know Steven Colbert did so too, in character. agent_1:Im not a big stephen colbert fan to be honest with you. Do you know that voter turnout or president hasnt crossed 62.8 percent in over 100 years agent_2:In all likelihood it will continue to drop and more people get frustrated with Congress. agent_1:You are probably right on that. Did you know that every president with a beard has been a republican.	agent_2:Must be in the GOP's rule book somewhere, they have been letting us down on that front over the past few years.

I didnt realize that they dominated in the northern states either. agent_2:ya I didn't either, also didn't know that red and blue weren't associated with republicans and democrats until the year 200 agent_1:Same here!  I thought those had been around forever! agent_2:I know! It seems like forever since we had a president who wasn't a Democrat or Republican, since 1853 actuallY! agent_1:That is a long time.  Just goes to show you how long the two party system has really been in power. agent_2:yup I agree, we should change how elections are run, did you know that Back in athens a long time ago, they would just do a lottery to elect officials agent_1:I heard that was because they wanted to avoid oligarchy. agent_2:yup you're right, its sad though, the highest voter turnout we've ever had in the USA was 62.8% agent_1:Maybe if there were options like Nevada has people would vote! agent_2:yup but if they are choosing to vote ""none of these candidates"" then your vote is still meaningless haha so whats the point of showing up"	agent_1:Well, if there was something in place that would require a new ticket if that got so many votes that would be great.	agent_2 likes technology. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['technology', 'smartphone', 'iPhone'].

I would prefer to watch the highlights and get the gist. agent_1:Yeah, they are better to attend in person. Or I should say they used to be better until they jacked the price of a beer up to $12. 	agent_2:I do not buy anything at games. i get loaded up before and then partake after. during the game, no.	agent_1 dislikes gaming. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['gaming', 'sports', 'team'].
10490	agent_1:Hi, do you use Amazon? agent_2:Hi, are you interested in Google, Amazon, or Artificial Intelligence? agent_1:All three of those actually. They are two of the biggest innovators we have and one of the most interesting scientific fields. agent_2:Yes, I agree. I really enjoy AI although all three of these topics are probably so interrelated that we don't realize it. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is sometimes called machine intelligence (which is actually demonstrated by the machines) in contrast to human intelligence. agent_1:Yes it is amazing what we can hopefully apply AI to in the future. It can really help out with some difficult tasks. agent_2:I took Computer Science in college and it is defined as the study of 'intelligent agents' or any device that perceives the environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. agent_1:I only took a basic Computer Science course, we never delved into Artificial Intelligence. I don't know too much about it besides some basic reading. agent_2:I learned some stuff in Master's level courses and colloquially, the term 'artificial intelligence' is applied when a machine mimics 'cognitive functions' that humans associate with other human minds such as 'learning' and 'problem solving'. agent_1:What do you think the biggest priority should be in the application of Artificial Intelligence? agent_2:Actually, the scope of AI is disputed as machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered as requiring 'intelligence' are often removed from the definition, a phenomenon known as the AI effect, leading to the quip in Teslar's Theorem, 'AI is whatever hasn't been done yet.' agent_1:I know some people are afraid of AI and think machines will become too self aware. I don't think we will ever run into that problem, science fiction has made people too paranoid. agent_2:I totally agree with that since machines are run on computer programs that humans wrote.  Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems such as chess and Go.	agent_1:I know I have lost my fair share of chess games to a computer, I even saw a computer compete at very high levels at Jeopardy. It only slipped up when questions were worded somewhat ambiguously.	agent_2 dislikes chess. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['chess', 'technology', 'AI'].
12337	agent_1:hi,  do you like animals?  did you know the loch ness monster is a protected species?  agent_2:I did not know that. That will come in handy once we find one. Also,Germany was the first country in the world to universally give animals legal rights that were constitutionally guaranteed.

It's animated, right? With lots of songs? agent_2:Yes it uses computer animation and it has love songs. It was super popular. There's a song that all the little kids were saying called""Let It Go and I guess it's based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale called the snow queen agent_1:HC wrote so many great stories. I read the Snow Queen a long time ago. I don't remember it.Has the movie won any awards? agent_2:I'm pretty sure that it has, I know that it made a ton of money. Apparently the villain used to sing that song I mentioned, Let It Go, but the song was so happy that they changed the character agent_1:that's good thinkg. I bet the song is up for an award somewhere. Who were the people involved in the film? agent_2:There's like a princess, a reindeer and a snowman, they're like them three most important characters. Also this is the first movie that was produced by Walt Disney and directed by a woman. agent_1:Not many films get directed by woman. That's good that she got the job. Good for Disney! They know how to spot talent."	agent_2:I think so. Apparently she was the first female director of a film that earned over 1 billion dollars too.

I like how the get along with the Dalmatians that are with firefighters that protect them. agent_1:There was a fire here in LA and so many horse were saved by out firefighters. Any other animals were not very lucky. It was very sad. We need to do more to protect animals agent_2:oh wow. Here in Iowa we don't really see fires like that. But I agree we do need to protect animals agent_1:There are so many different kinds of animals in the world. many are going way too. We need to be more like Germany. Have you head of what they are doing? agent_2:I have not really heard about what they are doing agent_1:they are projecting the rights of animals by giving them constitutional rights agent_2:that is a really good idea more counties should have that agent_1:yeah very cool right! We humans come from animals basically. Would you agree? agent_2:I would agree agent_1:We have so much of the same DNA and how we used to have so much hair back in the day like over 200000 years ago. That's crazy! agent_2:I can't it been that long agent_1:could be. Probably is goes all the way back to Africa I've recently learned. We are basically African animals at one point lol agent_2:I can see that. We sure have come along way since then	agent_1:or not lol..... I randomly learned sound can cause fear in humans.

1375	agent_1:Have you ever used the Rotten Tomatoes website? I check out all the movies I'm going to watch on there first. agent_2:You know, I do to.  I feel it's better to be informed than waste my time or money without knowing. agent_1:If I'm watching a movie at home I don't care about the reviews as much but definitely want to make sure I am getting my moneys worth at the theater. agent_2:Amen, to that.  Movie ticket prices are outrageous, nowadays.  Netflix has almost 150 movies that carry a 100% Rotten Tomatoes rating. agent_1:I've found it has been so hard to find a movie on Netflix, I have been watching a lot of their original content lately though. Do you watch Netflix? agent_2:All the time.  It is another one of those companies created by college students.  Lol.  All I did in college was party! agent_1:Yeah I didn't spend my time in college trying to make companies either, I wish I did though. agent_2:Just a random note, did you realize that Bruce Lee wa such a good dancer? agent_1:I did not, but with his athleticism and talent I am not surprised. agent_2:I know right!  He won the 1958 Cha Cha championship in Hong Kong.  I can not even picture that. agent_1:I would like to see some video of that. I have only seen a couple of his movies. agent_2:Speaking of dancing, are you aware that Michael Jackson holds a patent on a dance device?	agent_1:I did not know that but if anyone would have one it's him.	agent_2 likes TV show. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV show', 'movie', 'movie review'].

I can't believe it's already been 7 seasons since it first premiered on HBO on April 17,2011. agent_1:Yeah, the show has a tremendous following and could go on forever. but i think it is better to draw things to a close. especially because of the author. agent_2:Yes.  Did you know that Harry Lloyd is the great great great grandson of Charles Dickens? agent_1:Harry Lloyd? who is that ? i have heard of Charles Dickens. he wrote oliver twist. agent_2:Yes...Harry Lloyd plays Visery Targaryen on GOT. agent_1:Oh, ok. i am bad with names. i usually remember the names of the pretty women. LOL agent_2:LOL  Here's another one...Charlie Chapins granddaughter plays Talisa Maegyr on Game of Thrones. agent_1:Whoa. i guess famous people have famous descendants. I guess i am screwed here. LOL Who is your favorite GoT character? agent_2:I would have to say Khal Drogo.  Arya is the fastest rising baby name given to girls in the US...most likely due to Game of Thrones. agent_1:That guy is amazing. He played aquaman too. Arya is a good name. short, easy to spell.  agent_2:Yes!  GOT gets financed by Ireland because they film scenes there which boosts tourism incomes.  That makes sense. agent_1:I bet it is the same as LOTR and New Zealand. the locals might get tired of tourists though. agent_2:Maybe.  I myself would love it. lol  There is a National Geogrpahic wild show called Game of Lions that follows the lives of lions like GOT characters.  lol agent_1:Hm. well, i guess that GoT is a cultural phenomenon. Game of Lions sounds a bit flat though agent_2:Yes!  Do you like horses at all? agent_1:Yes, I do like horses, but I have never ridden one. they are majestic but expensive animals. Anyway, great chat! agent_2:Did you know that Clint Eastwood had a mid life allergy to horses?  It was a good chat! agent_1:That is too bad for clint. he loves horses!

I used Amazon for practically everything, but I also used Google. I guess I'm not alone because when Google went down for about five minutes in 2013, 40% of the web traffic went down with it. agent_1:I love Google as well, you know it was founded by two PHD students in Standford University agent_2:Yeah, and together they own 14 percent of the company, and control about 56% of the stockholder voting power. agent_1:I thought they owned a bigger percentage of the company, I heard the company wants to reoganize some of its interests in a company called Alphabet Inc agent_2:Yes, they actually announced that several years ago. Most recently, Larry Page was removed as the CEO of Google and is now the CEO of Alphabet.	agent_1:A guess that makes sense, Google is a big company and it must have more than one CEO for different divisions, have you ever used the Maps app?	agent_2 likes technology. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['technology', 'shopping', 'retailer'].

Its a great sport where individual players hit balls with clubs into a series of holes on a golf course in as few strokes as possible. agent_1:I never played because it looked expensive. How long have you played? agent_2:I have been playing for about 10 years now and another thing I wanted to mention that the golf course consists of 18 holes but if you play the game for fun its usually 9 holes. agent_1:Ok, but doesnt it cost a lot for the equipment and the greens fees and stuff? agent_2:Well that depends on the equipment you buy and also where you play. agent_1:I guess i would want the cheapest stuff. i played sports with minimal equipment growing up.	agent_2:The gold course requires a lot of water to maintain about 312,000 gallons in fact per day.	agent_1 likes water. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['water', 'sports', 'sports'].

Did it have anything to do with the 80th anniversary of the American Accordionists Association? agent_2:Yes I think so. And that one of the people among them is Lou Coppola, he's been doing this and playing the accordion for about 28 years now agent_1:Where is he from? agent_2:He's originally from Bridgeport, Connecticut, speaking of music though what kind of pop music do you like agent_1:I like all kinds.  I grew up in the 80's so that pop music era is my favorite.  I was surprised to find out that the actor Ricky Gervais was a pop singer in the 80s/	agent_2:Yeah that is shocking!

I did know however that Even though John Carter was considered a flop for Disney, it did great in Russia, even breaking box office records agent_1:Disney considered shutting down their animation studio after sleeping beauty was a box office failure. agent_2:Good think it didn't.  If you take inflation into account, the original Star Wars trilogy made more money that the prequels in the US by $1,328,009,800. agent_1:wow thats crazy! The silence of the lambs came out on valentine's day in 1991 and had a box office of over $270 million. agent_2:I didn't know it did that good.  The first game to surpass Hollywood box office sales was Mortal Kombat 2.  I actually saw that one.  I was a huge fan of the game. agent_1:The game was awesome!  Still a classic,  the movie was not that great lol  agent_2:The first one was I thought, but not the second one.  I was surprised to see that the Lord of the Rings trilogy made big losses even though it was a huge box office success. agent_1:Wow thats crazy!!  That was an amazing series! agent_2:I know, I am shocked it lost money.  I am also a humongous comedy fan.  Did you know that Drew Carey was in the Marine Corps for 8 years.  He would tell jokes to his fellow marines. agent_1:Yeah read that too,  i cant imagine him in the marines!  I love his show "" Whose line is it anyway?"" agent_2:Yes, that is a classic.

Is he an American Indian? agent_1:I think he might be partly american indigenous. I am not sure though. agent_2:Is he pretty ethnic? I think he'd have to be pretty ethnic to pull that off. Not like Elvis. Was Johnny a friend of Nic Cage? agent_1:He might be I am not sure. He even adopted the one eyed horse that was in the movie saleepy hollow agent_2:A one-eyed horse? That sounds odd.

I guess you would have to put an eyepatch over one of the eyes. agent_1:They were going to put the horse down so he wanted to save it agent_2:I guess he had a place for keeping horses.

Now we sit at home and just stream everything. I still like to get Netflix dvds cause I don't understand how to stream. My son laughs at me. agent_1:well apparently netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth so maybe you aren't the only one! agent_2:Yes, there's a lot of us old fogeys around. I liked them better before they changed their homepage. I find it very hard to find films anymore.Amazing that they are almost totally world-wide. agent_1:I agree. I hate the new set up. I didnt realalize netflix started its own content in 2012. I thought it was much more recent than that agent_2:Well at first I'm sure everyone thought that their self production shows would be like Japanese sci-fi films, not worth watching. but some of their shows are very highly rated. agent_1:do you like star wars? james earl jones only spent 2.5 hours recording all of darth vaders lines and was paid $7500 i cant decide if that was a lot or a little in the 70s agent_2:It was low for voice actors then but he certainly made the character more evil than anyone else could have. That series has made so many people rich. Especially George Lucas. agent_1:in 2018 the total value for the star wars franchise was $65 BILLION.

The New York Yankees have a lost player....never found! How odd. agent_1:That is odd... a man once found some 1900s baseball cards in his granfathers attic and they where worth 3 million bucks agent_2:Wow, lucky! Did you know kickball is considered a type of baseball in Canada? Interesting!  agent_1:That is interesting! Baseball is so popular in Japan that many fans are suprised to know it is considered Americas national pastime agent_2:That's funny, it has always been America's favorite pastime! I wonder if they take Baseball as serious as American's do lol, or if they watch the world series as well. agent_1:I have no clue... so you are a yankees fan agent_2:Yes, they are a very interesting team. Way back in 73 2 of the Yankees pitchers swapped families, permanently, pretty odd. agent_1:That is odd.. Bobby Richardson is the only person to win a world series mvp despite losing the series.. I know the Yankees are pretty well known bbut not to much else about baseball agent_2:Yeah, I don't know many Baseball teams. I do like the world series because it is pretty exciting to watch.

Do you have any favorites? I've tried my hand at creating both, and failed miserably! It's tough! It's an art form, that I just can't do! agent_1:I've been more into poetry lately. It's fascinating that it's been around since prehistorical times, with hunting poetry in Africa.  agent_2:Oh it's fascinating, for sure! Even more so to me since it eludes my abilities. heh. I've read that there is a poem which when read forwards is depressing, and when read backwards is inspiring! I'd really like to read it, but I can't find anything more about it, as of yet. agent_1:That is fascinating. Similarly, Demetri Martin once wrote a 224 word palindrome poem.  agent_2:Oh wow! Now there is a poem, I forgot that I loved! The Raven, by Edgar Allen Poe. It's been so long since I've heard it! I mean like 20+ years! Something about The Raven rap-tap-tapping on his door, or floor? Haha. I heard he only got $9 for the publication of that poem! Go figure. agent_1:Wow! Just $9?! Somebody got a bargain! Did you know Edgar Allen Poe also wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction? Pretty diverse author, isn't he? agent_2:Oh yeah? What an interesting person he must have been, in general! I don't even know what Javanese is , but apparently their alphabet when recited in order, is a poem. The ABC's are pretty poetic to me, now that we recite them so sing-songy. agent_1:I wonder what kind of poems a computer could come up with? Computers do everything else, they can control microwave ovens, remote controls, robots...why not write poetry, right? agent_2:Haha! I'm slightly certain that soon, they will write poetry. Computers have come such a long way! I found something really interesting, in 1936 the Russians made a computer that ran off of water! I wonder what went wrong with that. Maybe electricity and water wasn't the best idea? agent_1:Computers can be fairly delicate, I suppose. Smoking near apply computers voids the warranty by making it ""a biohazard"". What in the world could that mean? agent_2:Hm.. Yeah I know that smoking near them, just really clogs everything up, kind of taking dust and mixing it with the tarry nicotine and it creates a huge mess and can break a computer and completely stop the fans and such, but bio-hazard? I'm interested to learn why that is. Kinda scary! agent_1:Someone built a working 16 bit computer using nothing but the basic Minecraft building blocks. I wonder what kind warranty that one has?! agent_2:Haha! Woah! There's a thing called transhumanists I guess, and they want to upload their brains to computers and memory sticks! I don't want to do that! One lifetime is okay by me. I can only imagine the torment of a mind having to just live for possibly forever! Yikes! agent_1:I agree! What if people tried to read my mind's unpublished poetry! No thank you! I have some interesting fan fiction in my head, just like Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Hercules and Oedipus. But that's private! agent_2:Haha! I am quite happy keeping my thoughts to myself! It sounds like a scary sci-fi movie to me! My computer brain gets arrested and imprisoned for eternity in 100 years for some crazy new law! No thank you! agent_1:How much memory would it take to store all of us, anyway? Maybe less than I think. A space shuttle can run on 1mb of RAM.  agent_2:That's crazy! Precisely why I'm not an astronaut! I wouldn't want to do crazy things such as trust my life to 1mb of ram!  agent_1:Haha! There's a good science fiction  book, The Martian, which has some interestin parts about computers and space shuttles. That author had a pretty good imagination. "	agent_2:Woah! In the 50's a judge tried to ban a sci-fi comic because it featured a black character! Thank goodness, we've come a long way from that hatefulness.

I love watching the Chicago Cubs in the NL. agent_1:It was so awesome to see them finally win the World Series in 2016. agent_2:Yes that was so exciting!    Especially after a 108 year drought! agent_1:Totally! They were the first team to ever win back-to-back World Series, then nothing. agent_2:Yes I do love Wrigley field where they play - its within the city agent_1:Did you know they evidently didn't win for so long because they were ""cursed"" by a man named Billy because Wrigley Field security would let him stay there with his pet goat? agent_2:Yes - who takes a goat to a baseball game?  But 5 million people celebrated in the streets after they finally won! agent_1:I would have, too! For one of the oldest teams in the major league? What a day. agent_2:Yes.  The Cubs and Atlanta are the two oldest teams - founded the same year as the battle of little bighourn! agent_1:It's so weird to think that the Cubs is only one of the two baseball teams in Chicago. agent_2:Yes that is pretty funny.  They have always been unique - they have had pitchers with 4, 5, and 6 fingers!"	agent_1:That's pretty neat.

Much cooler than,  say, playing the accordion...  agent_1:Do you play any instruments? I gave up videogames and started playing the piano a couple years ago, and I haven't looked back since haha agent_2:No, unless you count an mp3 player.  I do love music except of stuff like accordions.  I definitely wouldn't pay $25 a ticket for that kind of music. agent_1:No, and it's shocking that a creed concert was so bad that people filed a lawsuit against them, on the other hand I don't really like creed so I'm not that surprised haha agent_2:Wow, they must have been really buzzed.  I don't know if Creed is considered pop but I mostly like alternative and stuff off the beaten path.  You? agent_1:I really like classic rock and 80's, I can listen to almost anything except country, I do like pink floyd a lot and that's awesome they did a live concert to no audience haha agent_2:I do like 80s stuff like REM and the B52s... I even go back further once in a while and listed to Pink Floyd as recorded on a floating recording studio.   agent_1:ha I would love to do that, I do like Queen, I didn't know their guitarist uses coins as guitar picks, did you see the new movie that came out about Queen? agent_2:Loved Freddie and his band... I haven't seen the movie yet but want to... Did ya know that scientists declared ""We Are the Champions"" the catchiest pop song of all time.  Scientists? agent_1:haha like how do you measure that? It is catchy but I would think it would be another song, ti's scary that lincoln park has done 324 concerts in 2001, that's almost 1 per day that sounds exhausting agent_2:Yep.  That's crazy.  They must like doing it cause that has to take its toll.  I guess performers like that go all the way back to ancient Greece and Rome.  We still use their acoustic designs for venues/amphitheaters.  agent_1:Yes that is probably why Pink Floyd played the live concert in that Roman amphitheater, even though there was no one their the acoustics must have been amazing, it's shocking they didn't record a video at least agent_2:No kidding... I would like to see that.  Pink Floyd is very creative but on the dark side.  While I'm not big on pop at least it's mostly upbeat albeit mind numbing...  agent_1:ya it is, pop music is good in small quantities for me, I like more complex stuff but pop music is good to pass the time and for parties agent_2:Yeah… I prefer guitars and amped up stuff to most R&B, rap and hip-hop. agent_1:I can't believe that the Ramones played a total of 2,263 concerts so far that is a massive number."

I was not a well behaved kid. What about you? agent_1:I have 3 adult kids.  Only one was a real challenge.  As a parent, it's easy to feel like a failure during this phase. agent_2:Did they want all the newest clothing because when I was a kid I made my mom buy me really nice shirts. agent_1:My daughter did, not so much with my sons.  Sometimes when as a parent or husband, it's better just to walk of and regroup.  agent_2:I would make her buy me shirts that cost 100 or more. Did you know that Mark Zuckerburg the facebook Ceo, wear plain grey T-shirts that cost 300 or 400$ agent_1:That's nuts.  Mine cost less than $10.  You want nice things for your kids but when it gets ridiculous, stand your ground and don't doubt yourself.  agent_2:I really like nice clothing, clothing has always been something people love. Did you know that The greeks made asbestos clothing and it was as valuable as gold. agent_1:Sounds itchy... I think it's funny that Pilgrims wore colorful clothes, not just black. Stereotypes... I bet they didn't eat turkey all the time either.   agent_2:It amazing how traditions get passed along, I even heard about an african tribe that wears victorian cloths because german occupiers they saw. agent_1:Interesting.  It's also interesting that polo shirts were actually invented by a tennis player Lacoste nicknamed ""the gator"". agent_2:I feel like people just follow others in their beliefs. Do you belive Isaac Newton and his law of Gravity? agent_1:I'm with Einstein in that it isn't a force like Newton says but rather the curvature of space. agent_2:Do you think the earth is moving  and flying through space at 500k mph. I have heard new ideas about a motionless round earth with maybe even a dome. Did you know they say the universe makes sounds"	agent_1:We haven't had such ideas since Copernicus.

That's pretty cool. Isn't that one lady from Bri bang also like a pHd? agent_2:I'm not sure but wouldn't doubt it. Facebook is developing AI designed to better understand emotions, identify objects, and predict user actions. Yikes.  agent_1:Clifford seems to be a great way to augment teaching. I would like to see a pre and post test with a control group to see how well the AI works. agent_2:Interesting. At Stanford they use Google Hangouts to teach AI more effectively.  agent_1:That's interesting. I teach college courses and would love to see how that works. I wonder if the non-for-profit has more info on it. agent_2:Good question. How about this one -- there's a NASA scientist who believes our world is just a computer generated VR. Maybe he's been watching too much of The Matrix.  agent_1:That's nuts. I sometimes wonder if the ultra-intelligent need things to maintain their sanity... agent_2:Haha. Definitely. Overthinking can be a torture, I'm sure. The first Virtual Reality game was created in 1968. How far we've come! agent_1:I would love to go on Lockheed Martin's virtual reality tour of mars. seems like it would be a lot of fun. agent_2:It does sound fun. Up to 40% of VR users get motion sickness -- me included. So make sure to take your barf bag if you go, just in case.  agent_1:I never thought of that impact on people. Have you ever gone on 4D rides at like disney? They move and shake but then they also spray water on you for when you go through water tunnels or something like that. Pretty fun. agent_2:Yeah, I took my daughter on the Stitch ride and she FREAKED OUT! She thought it was real. I felt so bad. But that's proof that 4D can ramp up the experience.  agent_1:HA! How old is she? My 7 year old went on a roller coaster for the first time and freak out until the end and then I could not get him off the rides.	agent_2:She was 11.

If you take inflation into account, the original Star Wars trilogy made more money that the prequels in the US by $1,328,009,800. agent_1:wow thats crazy! The silence of the lambs came out on valentine's day in 1991 and had a box office of over $270 million. agent_2:I didn't know it did that good.  The first game to surpass Hollywood box office sales was Mortal Kombat 2.  I actually saw that one.  I was a huge fan of the game. agent_1:The game was awesome!  Still a classic,  the movie was not that great lol  agent_2:The first one was I thought, but not the second one.  I was surprised to see that the Lord of the Rings trilogy made big losses even though it was a huge box office success. agent_1:Wow thats crazy!!  That was an amazing series! agent_2:I know, I am shocked it lost money.  I am also a humongous comedy fan.  Did you know that Drew Carey was in the Marine Corps for 8 years.  He would tell jokes to his fellow marines. agent_1:Yeah read that too,  i cant imagine him in the marines!  I love his show "" Whose line is it anyway?"" agent_2:Yes, that is a classic.

A helicopter? That's a rich person's solution.  agent_2:And wait, grass tennis court? I wonder how well the ball bounced.

8093	"agent_1:hello there  agent_2:Hello yourself> What have you been getting up to tonight? agent_1:Just relaxing, hanging with my dog.  Listening to music. Yourself?  agent_2:Similar regarding the dog. I was talking to my roommate about MLS Soccer.  agent_1:I like Orlando City, personally. I have a good friend who used to play for Manchester United.  agent_2:Really? I bet that was wild.  I didn't think I'd ever need to know much about it myself. We were actually talking about Wayne Rooney a little bit ago.  agent_1:Do you have any thoughts about where Wayne Rooney will end up next year?  agent_2:No thoughts but I've heard talk. Atlanta has gone nuts for MLS the last couple of years. We won the Cup this year and now when you walk into a bar you hear guys speculating about Rooney to DC United next year.   agent_1:Orlando has embraced MLS too, I am quite surprised how popular it has become.   agent_2:I'm with you 110% on that. I haven't heard anyone talk about how embarrassing the Falcons are in weeks.  It makes sense. We haven't ever really had a winner before. I'm wondering if Rooney can still play or if this is like Beckham playing in LA when the MLS began.  agent_1:To switch gears for a moment, I'm listening to Dizzy Gillespie at the moment.  He always was a favorite of mine, a trumpet virtuoso. Did you now that jazz trumpeters often grow goatees because it provides comfort when they play their instrument?  agent_2:I didn't but I can see why that would be appealing.The facial hair I mean. I've tried to like it but Jazz just doesn't do much for me.  New Orleans jazz is sort of the exception. I like the big brass sections. I do like zydeco and that has a lot of jazz influence.   agent_1:I definitely would say I prefer music that's influenced by jazz, rather than jazz itself. Tom Waits is my favorite artist ever, and the influence of jazz is present on a lot of his work.   agent_2:I agree with you about the influence it's had on other music. It's kind of funny that you brought up jazz actually.  It's such a mish mash of musical influences from around the world but it's probably still the most original art form that the United States has ever produced.  That's sort of what we've got going on with the Atlanta FC here.   agent_1:Did you now that the term soccer came from ""association football""? I find that interesting. I always wondered why it wasn't called something else.  agent_2:I didn't know that. I've wondered though.  We've got all of these sports fans here from different places with competing team loyalties.  Except for soccer. Most of them never had a pro team that they grew up rooting for.  They all grew up knowing something about that.  I mean we're talking 250 million players worldwide. Now these guys have a team to root for with no competing loyalties. It's a more communal experience and it has taken off around here.   agent_1:Do you ever go to live games?  It's an experience I have only very recently had an opportunity to possibly enjoy, and yet I haven't.  I wonder if I would enjoy it for the entire duration of the game.  agent_2:I haven't gone yet but I'm going to this coming season.  My interest in other sports has waned so the timing is perfect. Get in on the ground floor of something special you know. It's hard to pick up though. You wouldn't think it would you. A big stretch of grass with a goal on either side's more complex than I thought. Theres way more people to talk about it with too. More than all the major American sports leagues combines in terms of fanbase.  agent_1:Yep, it gives you something to talk about with so many people from different countries. I think that's really cool. They really mean the ""world"" when they said the world cup, unlike the world series, which is just a national matchup.  That's interesting you say it's tough to pick up. I bet the best way to really learn about it would be to play FIFA video games. agent_2:Thats a good point about playing FIFA. That was my only exposure to the sport growing up. There's a much lower barrier to entry to play the game in the real world. Probably part of it's popularity. It's kind of funny. The color scheme and the uniforms here kind of remind me of Harry Potter.  I guess ridiculous hats are a thing in football circles. I don't know how else to explain the goofy ones I've seen around here after FC games.   agent_1:Sports fans are definitely responsible for some ridiculous hats, like the oversided cowboy hat, that's like measured in gallons rather than regular hat size. I'm not a hat guy myself, my head's too big.  Speaking of cowboy hats, in the old west, the cowboy hat was not the most common hat worn.  It was actually the bowler, which truthfully is a lot classier looking in my opinion. "	agent_2:Billy the Kid was a bowler hat kind of guy. I like hats because I'm bald. They keep the sweat out of my eyes and keep my head warm.  Sports fans have changed headwear from a social status thing to more of a social group identity thing. Ironically the only times I'm not likely to wear a hat is when it would be the most useful. I've worked in construction most of my life but I could never get used to wearing a hard hat.

Did you know the international observes were banned from nine states to check on the polls? agent_1:Yeah. Did you know the white house has twin buildings in other countries? agent_2:Yes those are in Ireland and France as well agent_1:Yeah. ANd they still use floppy discs to save stuff	agent_2:Yeah.

4266	agent_1:Hey there!  Are you a Beatles fan? agent_2:Good evening, why yes, I am.  Are you? agent_1:Who was your favorite Beatle?  Think I like Ringo just 'cause he's kinda goofy. agent_2:George Harrison was my favorite.	agent_1:Cool.  Most people tend to say John or Paul.  Probably because they were the primary songwriters.

3589	"agent_1:I am sure that you know that Black Panther is a Marvel Comics character, right? agent_2:The richest superhero. Worth $500 billion. agent_1:That's the one!  The origins of the script for the movie date back to the 4th century. agent_2:The character was not named after the black panther party. agent_1:No.  LOL.  Caught me off guard with that.  The old script was written in Nigeria. agent_2:Chadwick Boseman played the character Black Panther. agent_1:The film was sure a block buster.  Apparently Denzel Washington helped him get his education. agent_2:Supporting his training at Oxford. agent_1:I see.  To change the subject, did you know that over 80 of the earth's forest have been destroyed in the history of our planet? agent_2:I believe it. We need the land for farming and people want the lumber. agent_1:Yes.  I heard that when the Europeans discovered North America, a squirrel could go from coast to coast without touching the ground. Now we expect to have no helium left on earth is less than 82 years. agent_2:I wonder if the aliens will need the helium when they finally settle on our planet. The UN now has an ambassador for extraterrestrials. agent_1:Unless there really is ""warp speed"" I think it will take aliens too long to get here.  I did hear about that ambassador being appointed in 2010. agent_2:The earth covered mostly with water in the form of oceans. I think that the aliens might want our planet for the water. agent_1:Could be.  But if they don't have any they won't know that they find it useful.  Fortunately for sea levels, both of our poles are covered with ice. agent_2:Do you read non-fiction? It's fascinating stuff. agent_1:I have read quite a bit.  I like Grisham and Clancy.  But I also like the best selling non-fiction book, the Bible. agent_2:Jack London lived as a poor person in London, and wrote a book about it. agent_1:It is hard to write about things one has not experienced.  That is why Grisham's books are about the law.  George W Bush reading 14 biographies of Lincoln is a person trying hard to do well. agent_2:He also read a lot of nonfiction. Good way to get an education. No need for school.  agent_1:I agree.  Education should continue through one's life.  Who would have thought that one of only 8 people to have both a fiction and non-fiction best seller would be a country singer? agent_2:A man of many talents! Well, I enjoyed chatting!"	agent_1:Me too, nice chat.	agent_2 likes small talk. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['small talk', 'movie', 'no'].

Did you know dogs have 12 different blood types? agent_2:That is cool.  I heard they also have doggie blood drives too. agent_1:Yeah that is super cool!  Did you also know that dogs are not color blind like most people think? agent_2:Yeah, I heard that they can see colors, not as well as we do but still in color agent_1:They also, along with elephants, are the only two animals the seem to understand pointing by instincts.  agent_2:They are definitely mart animals.  That might by Google prefers them to cats.	agent_1:That is so weird, and I guess they came out and declared they were a dog company. 	agent_2 likes technology. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['technology', 'pets', 'dog blood drives'].

The Thin Silence? i havent heard of it. agent_1:Yes apparently it's being developed by Two PM Studios, it sounds really crazy it uses the look of videogames from the 80's agent_2:What? the 80s? like NES and stuff?  Why? seems odd. agent_1:Yes I think so! Do you play any video games by the way? agent_2:i used to play a long long time ago. havent played recently. the systems look cool, but i dont have the time LOL agent_1:Yeah I hear you on that haha. It's funny that initially video games were called ""cathode ray tube Amusement devices""LOL that sucks all the fun out of them agent_2:That is a totally military name. too many words, too official sounding. pointless. agent_1:Have you ever visited South Korea? Apparently if you're under 16 it's illegal for you to play video games after midnight haha agent_2:I think that there is a video game craze there. plus there are games cafes that are open all night  agent_1:That sounds pretty cool. Did you ever play a video game based on Toy Story? Apparently Tom Hanks his brother, Jim Hanks, does all of the voices for Woody in the video games agent_2:that's great. Tom has enough money, and his brother could use the work. how would you like to be his brother? That would be tough, overshadowed by Tom agent_1:It would be tough but you're still making a lot of money haha. Have you ever played the Harry Potter video games or even LittleBigPlanet? Apparently this guy Stephen Fry does the narration in those games, I bet he also makes a lot of money"	agent_2:I have not.

I was surprised there a website for people with couches to crash on, wish I knew it last week I had a long layover. agent_1:Whoa that's awesome! Did you eat crepes? I want to go to Iceland but it sounds like the public transport isn't great-will probably rent a car. agent_2:No crepes, I did have snails which I like. I've had a layover in Iceland, it looks like the moon. Flying it a lot of volcanic lava flows turned to rock. Did you know about that gnome stealing thing, take a picture, then return? That a lot of work. agent_1:Haha yeah I heard about that. Does sound like a lot of work. Did you fly any domestic flights in Iceland? That seems like a good way to get around there. agent_2:No, Iceland Air is cheapest to Sweden, I work there a couple times a year. I'm on the east coast so it's a quick flight though. Do you like fiction, a reader? That how I bide my time. agent_1:Awesome lucky. Yeah fiction is entertaining. I like it because it is not based strictly on history or fact. agent_2:Yes, I'm not much on Science Fiction, more literary fiction. I didn't know Isaac Asimov coined ""robotics"" I have friends who  love him and Sci Fi. What genre do you like? agent_1:Oh nice good genre. I like fiction as well. Edgar Allen Poe's first developed cyborg's in fiction which is pretty cool.  agent_2:Yes and Poe developed the detective genre I read too. I read War and Peace, but the Smash Bros is 4 million words even longer? That would take some time. agent_1:Wow. Is War and Peace good? I know Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction but I have never read his text. agent_2:Yes, I liked it but it's a complex novel. Yes, I read Caesar history of the Gallic Wars. Pretty interesting in light of France now. Do you like music, you see where the highest violin bow price sold for $182,000 wow, that quite expensive per pound. agent_1:You have read a lot I'm impressed. I love music and sometimes classical. Hard to believe a violin sold for that. Hopefully it wasn't the one made out of stone! agent_2:Gold and tortoiseshell i read, I feel sorry for the turtle. You like fiddle or violin more? Country or classic as the instrument is the same."	agent_1:Wow. Interesting. I like the fiddle because I prefer country music.

I know that it can earn some people lots of money. agent_1:Well, let me inform you! They once used a helicopter to dry the grass for the 69 us open! agent_2:A helicopter? Well, I guess rich folk have all kind of resources at their disposal. Never needed to do that again, I guess. agent_1:I would have just had to tried to blow it dry with my breath. Would have taken forever! agent_2:They know how to think big in tennis, that's for sure. The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days. I wonder if anyone watched the whole thing. agent_1:They would have been sleepy after! Like I am after binge watching some netflix. agent_2:Netflix has fostered so much binge watching.

4833	"agent_1:Do you like fish? agent_2:Yes, I love fish (at least eating it). I find it funny that freshwater fish only ""drink"" water through their skin via osmosis, while saltwater fish also drink water through their mouths. agent_1:I like to eat them too, and that is funny, have you heard of the black swallower fish before? agent_2:Well, I've heard that they can eat prey twice their length and ten times their weight, so they must be quite strong.  agent_1:I agree and also a scary species, they seem like quite the predator agent_2:Yeah, for sure! I also found it interesting that a seahorse is the only fish to have a neck. I didn't even know it was a kind of fish. agent_1:The only one? reallly? that is suprising I though most fish had a neck agent_2:Actually, I think what we take for a fish's neck (I've made this mistake also) is not really a neck, but more the area where their gills come out. I find it interesting also that 84 per cent of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish. agent_1:Sounds like a fish we have to study a lot more closely, they can be the solution to many of our health problems and the immortal jellyfish agent_2:Yeah, for sure! It's kind of funny actually, because they said that in humans, that if a human has a rib surgically shortened, that he/she can regrow a rib equally as strong as the original within only 2-3 months. agent_1:Humans are just amazing, we adapt for persistnace and we are the best distance runners in all the animal kingdom agent_2:Yeah, for sure! Humans do have their downfalls though, because they cannot synthesize their own vitamin c like animals and plants can. agent_1:I guess its a great thing we know how to appy science,  agent_2:Yeah, for sure! One thing that humans have going for them however is their creativity. Did you know that there is an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel? That's really funny.  agent_1:I didnt know that, do you like to read? it does sound like a funny contest agent_2:Yes, I love reading. It's kind of funny, because architecture, literature, music, painting and sculptures were olympic events from 1912 until 1952. I don't know why those would be considered sports, but that is quite interesting."	agent_1:It is interesting, never considered as sports either, do you know who Winston Churchill was?

8726	agent_1:Do you have children? agent_2:No I do not, how about you? agent_1:I do and he seems to be hitting puberty. Moody tween all the time. agent_2:Ah I assume that is causing some difficultly. Is there anything in particular he is stubborn on?  agent_1:He is a great kid, until he plays Fortnite. Something about that game gets him all jacked up and he acts like a different kid. agent_2:There have been a lot of studies on video games and it's effect on children. The consensus always seems to be that they use it as an outlet.  agent_1:I think listening to the way the other people talk and act affects him. He's usually mild and polite, but when he plays with them, he gets very hyper and surly. I also think it's the change in hormones. agent_2:That could very well be the case. Hormones seem to do something to susceptibility, at least it was for me as a teen.  agent_1:He's also at the awkward, trying to figure out who he is, stage. It's fun to really watch his personality develop. agent_2:It's such a weird place to be in the world. They are starting to take on more adult responsibilities but at the same time are still kids in a lot of ways.  agent_1:Right! He is such a little kid about some things, but he's starting to look at girls differently and it's a weird situation to be in. He used to tell me everything, but not so much anymore. agent_2:Wanting to have some secrets its about right developmentally speaking. Just feeling out some small forms of independence.  agent_1:His voice has also started to change. He is taking after his father with a super low, bass filled voice. It's crazy to hear that low deep voice come out of a kid! I'm wondering what else we are going to be in store for as he changes? agent_2:Has he already been through the outgrowing every bit of clothing stage? 	agent_1:He's growing like he's getting paid for it!

Do you like it? agent_2:I read mainly non fiction too,  but I can get in to some of it. I think it is cool that there is a wiki that ranks fictional characters according to their powers. agent_1:I find that useful too! Edgar allen poe wrote about a cyborg, the oldest example of it. agent_2:Wow, that is kind of neat.  I thought that was a more modern invention.	agent_1:Me too.

So cold! agent_1:Wow!! Its definitely a good day to stay in and catch some movies. Speaking of movies, Black Panther has the richest superhero out there, worth $500 billion! agent_2:That's a lot of money. They are re-releasing th emovie for free from February 1 - 7 for african american month... agent_1:Wow!! Thats amzinzing. I know there was a lot of confusion when the movie was first released...many people confused it with the black panther party.  agent_2:Yeah, they are a lot different. T'challa is the richest superhero/ agent_1:That's interesting! You know, there's a lot that we can do with this extra day off with the cold and all...we have the whole day to indulge. Did you know that when the Earth was first formed, a day was only 5.5 hours long? agent_2:I had no idea. I do know that I am working on this cold day and worked out this morning. It has been a cold day! agent_1:Yes it has. The weather and the earth's atmosphere is forever changing. By the 21st century, we anticipate running out of Helium. That's going to significantly impact human life...scary!! agent_2:How is it going to impact humans> I am curious to know more! agent_1:Well, for one, Helium makes up a large portion of our atmosphere. I do know that. And Helium helps to keep things floating so I can only imagine the impact will be negative! agent_2:Thanks for the insight. I had no idea! agent_1:I'm just thinking about how our atmosphere works... I', no expert but I think its safe to say that the absence of Helium could come at a high cost. agent_2:I agree. I had no idea that it was that precious. agent_1:Yessss!! I guess we could gain more insight about what the future holds for humanity by reading the bible. Did you know that the bible is the biggest selling non-fiction book ever printed? That's pretty impressive! agent_2:I did. George W bush read 41 biographies of lincoln. That's crazy! I do not think Lincoln knew that much about himself. agent_1:That's funny!! And probably true!! He also read 186 historical nonfiction books!! That's a lot of knowledge! agent_2:Yeah, I can barely read and here he is showing off reading that much@ agent_1:I hear ya!! Jack London lived as a poor down and out pauper and still managed to write a book about exposing the gap between the rich and the poor. So there's always hope!! Keep at your reading... and you'll get better! agent_2:I hope! I have written a lot so I hope it all comes together! agent_1:I do too!!! Well, its been good talking to you. I have to get going.

The US has had close relationships with those countries for years. agent_2:Their versions probably don't still use floppy disks for storing like ours does partially agent_1:I wonder if that is for security purposes. Strangely outdated tech. Hm. agent_2:That was my guess too. I find it interesting how many times the White House has undergone renovations. The West Wing wasn't created until 1901, and it was expanded only eight years after that agent_1:It was a modest residence. The guest house is bigger, I hear. I wonder when that was built. agent_2:Who knows? I'm surprised Trump hasn't made any changes to the White House. Solar panels were put on the back by George W. Bush, and I've heard that's not the first time they've attempted solar power agent_1:Carter put them on first. Oil shock and that. Reagan removed them. Clinton did nothing. agent_2:At least none of them banned Christmas trees like Teddy Roosevelt did agent_1:Teddy was a conservationist. He did like destroying nature. Unless they were animals with heads for trophies. agent_2:Think he made clothing from fur? I wouldn't be surprised if he did agent_1:He probably did. I guess he thought he was being manly by killing wild animals. Seems senseless. There are other ways to prove your toughness. agent_2:True, though I'm sure it was good insulation in the winter agent_1:Yes, that's true. He was an interesting guy. Larger than life. agent_2:I wonder if he would have had an iPhone if he lived in this decade. Women are more likely to own them than men, but maybe he would have preferred Apple agent_1:I think he would have hated technology like that. He was an outdoorsman.  agent_2:He might have tried the game ""Send me to heaven"" by throwing his into the air. He wouldn't have minded a shattered phone if he won agent_1:LOL. Probably not.

It's so confusing when they trade players for me to follow! agent_1:Yea, I guess the manager Martinez isn't doing too good in Washington and traded them away agent_2:I think the Cubs have been having a lot of trouble with their player's health. I hope they can turn it around and have a good season! agent_1:Maybe, but the Cubs haven't been too lucky since they started in 1903 agent_2:I think I've heard about that...are they the team that one back to back and then haven't won another World Series since then? agent_1:The Cubs didn't win until 2016, they beat the Royals I believe  agent_2:Oops meant won not one. I remember a long time ago they lost in a famous World Series game to the White Sox. I'm glad they won recently, as it's been a long time! agent_1:Yea, When the Cubs won 5 million people celebrated in the street, they have been waiting a long time	agent_2:I bet that was one of the best baseball celebrations ever!

The drinks sound yummy too. agent_2:Yeah they do, and fresh guacamole is always so good.  agent_1:I'd try chipotle infused tequila with my guac and chips! agent_2:Yeah that also sounds super good, I love tequila! agent_1:Have you had queso fundido?

Water is a very important resource that helps give life on earth. agent_1:Yes it does and the earth's surface is covered by about 71% of water.  The polar regions are covered in ice but that is just frozen water so-more water on the earth's surface. agent_2:That is true although I am not much into the science of earth.

It looks like amazon means exciting news. They are now looking for a site for a second headquarters! agent_1:That's great! Not everyone thinks so though, Amazon can come with difficulties in transportation and shoot up the housing costs of whatever city it's in.  agent_2:They do make an impact wherever they go. I found interesting that there is a building named after the first amazon.com customer agent_1:I heard they're considering Washington as a place for their 2nd HQ, wherever they put the building is going to get a huge boost! I heard they're even considering New York! agent_2:Also Los angeles, atlanta, and Dallas. they are looking for as much as 8 million sq ft agent_1:Don't forget about their original HQ, it was founded by Jeff Bexos on July 5 1994. And it's the largest internet retailer in the world!  agent_2:An in the US they are the most valuable company after Apple and Microsoft, they have really grow so much! agent_1:It's probably thanks to their hard-workers!

For instance, there is a poem where if you read it one way it's sad, but read it in reverse and it's actually inspirational! agent_1:Wow, I bet that poem required a lot creativity, wrtting a poem with completely different meanings, oposing genres, genius agent_2:There is one guy that wrote a poem of over 220 words in palindrome (where it is the same backwards and forwards -- like ""nurses run"")! agent_1:Sounds really hard, did you ever read one of Edgar Allan Poe's poems? agent_2:I think I read a couple.  I feel like I know them so well because of horror and Halloween stories.  I know ""The Raven"" was pretty popular.  Do you think he made a lot of money with that poem? agent_1:Not really in fact he only made $9 for the publication of that poem, seems really underpaid agent_2:Wow!  That is crazy!  I hope he had a good day job.  Maybe just regular fiction works would have been better financially. agent_1:I hope he did as well, the raven is like his most popular poem and selling it for $9, business was slow, he also wrote cyborg fiction, agent_2:That's pretty cool.  If he'd had a black character in it in the 1950s that was worthy of banning a science fiction comic! agent_1:That sounds really racist, theres a wiki rank of fictional characters according to power and abilities,  I wonder who is the strongest hero agent_2:Maybe like a Superman type or Hercules?  Funny thing, future emperor Julius Caesar actually wrote Hercules based fan fiction when he was younger.  I wonder what that was like. agent_1:I bet it was pretty good, it was about Hercules and Oedipus, I wonder if he was good. agent_2:Game of Thrones author, George RR Martin, might not have cared for it.  Maybe Caesar would get a pass, but Martin doesn't care for fan fiction at all! agent_1:Yeah I heard he hated fan fiction, he doesnt care about it at all so changing the subject a bit do you use computers a lot? agent_2:It seems like that is what I do the vast majority of my day.  I'm not ready to upload my mind to a computer or memory stick like transhumanists, but it is like an extension of me some days. agent_1:I agree theres so much we dont understand about the human mind, Transhumanist must be missing key elements of the human essence. agent_2:Are you a PC or a Mac?  Be warned that being a smoker an an apple computer user could actually void the warranty as they see it as a biohazard if someone smokes by it.  I am neither, but that's beside the point. agent_1:I have a mac and I dont smoke but its good  to know, seems kind of random to void a warranty because of that, "	"agent_2:Maybe they should have tried to make a water-based computer, which apparently the Russians were able to make in 1936.

Did you know that Not all men in the uk had the right to vote until 1918. agent_2:I didn't know that but I do know that  this country still engages is voter suppression; not much has changed over the years with the GOP	agent_1:Here is a crazy fact. 34% of the black male population in alabama has permanently lost the right to vote.	agent_2 dislikes politics. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'greeting', 'greeting'].
847	agent_1:Hi and good afternoon. Are you a poetry fan? It has a long history dating back to prehistoric times. agent_2:Hi, how are you? i am not a big fan of poetry. Are you? agent_1:I think it's fun to read sometimes. The origins are more interesting for me. Early poems in the Eurasian content evolved from folksongs.  agent_2:I dont much about poetry. that is interesting. i guess poetry and songs would be closely related. agent_1:Yes I suppose they would. They tried to define poetry in ancient Greece such as Aristotle's poetics. It focused on the use of speech in rhetoric, drama, song, and comedy. agent_2:I guess poetry is spoken and written, so it is related to many arts. Do you have a favorite poet? agent_1:I think it's funny when comedians do poetry. I don't really have a favorite poet. Demetri Martin wrote a 224 word palindrome! agent_2:that must have taken him quite a while. 224 words, backwards and forwards? my head hurts. agent_1:Yes mine hurts just thinking about it. Edgar Allan Poe is another classic poet and he only received $9 for the publication of his poem the Raven. agent_2:He probably spent it on drugs and booze too. the man was so decadent, but maybe it inspired him. agent_1:Yeah you probably did. I love the hobbit too. Most of the character names were taken out of an old Icelandic poem called dvergatal. agent_2:Yes, Tolkien loved old languages. he studied them and learned to speak some of them.  agent_1:That is so fascinating, I love his works of fiction. I like fiction because it is so imaginative. What is your favorite genre? agent_2:I like non fiction because i want to keep up with what is going on in the world.  agent_1:That's good and definitely practical. The author of game of thrones despises fan fiction because he says it is copyright infringement and not a good exercise for aspiring writers. I kind of see where he's coming from. agent_2:the fans should try to write their own stories, not rehash someone else's.  agent_1:Exactly. I think it's so funny authors used have to write on old typewriters. Now they have computers which can basically carry out any sequence of arithmetic or logical operations. agent_2:Yes, the typewriter changes the relationship between the writer and the prose. i figure that the computer makes my writing different. agent_1:Yes probably mine as well now that you mention it. If you have an Apple computer make sure you don't smoke near it because it voids the warranty. Very nice talking with you this afternoon. agent_2:What about vaping? is vaping ok? LOL Yes, i enjoyed chatting!	agent_1:Ha ha that is very important information I need to know too!

4148	"agent_1:Have you seen Kevin Spacey in the ""Billionaire Boys Club"" movie? agent_2:I haven't seen it, actually. Is it any good? agent_1:I haven't. I heard that it's opening was a career low opening day total for Spacey, though. It's because of all the bad accusations against him, I think. agent_2:I saw him in the movie Baby Driver, but the accusations are definitely a deterrent for some people with how widespread #MeToo has become agent_1:Yes, I actually haven't seen him in a movie since American Beauty. I watch movies on Netflix sometimes. Do you? agent_2:I have to be in the mood since I like to read and listen to a lot of books. I tend to create a watchlist on Netflix faster than I can watch things, but I like how convenient it is. I can't imagine having to rent movies from Blockbuster agent_1:Netflix is really popular now. I hear it accounts for a third of all the bandwidth in North America during late night. agent_2:I think the shows and movies help people unwind now, and there's no commercial breaks. Combined with YouTube, the two account for half the bandwidth in North America agent_1:I hear Netflix actually spends more on postage than on bandwidth. The owner started the company after being annoyed by a late fee of his VHS movie rental. agent_2:I would be annoyed about a rental fee that's higher than it costs for the VHS. It's still strange to think that people still use the rental service, but I guess internet connection isn't always the best in some places"	agent_1:Yes I think maybe it's from parents getting stuff for their kids to watch while they can watch streaming Netflix at the same time.	agent_2 likes streaming. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['streaming', 'entertainment', 'TV shows'].

13111	agent_1:Hi! Have you ever traveled to Japan?  agent_2:No, I have not but I have been to Hawaii and had family there when the ballistic missile threat message went out the morning of Jan. 13th. They were really scared. agent_1:Yeah, i remember that! With japan being so small it can cost you $300 to drive across it if you take the highway. Tolls are crazy expensive!  agent_2:Thats crazy! That is just like Hawaii too. agent_1:Are all of their Highways tolled? Are they expensive?  agent_2:They are really cram packed with cars but no tolls. The bad thing about being there is that a missile can get there from North Korea in less than 30  mins. agent_1:Whoa, thats crazy! I had no idea they were so close! Funny to think that China believes that Kim jong un is the sexiest man alive! agent_2:Wow, I did not know that! Yikes! In the era of Kim Jong-un we have to worry about his ability to send a missile over and that's a little scary. agent_1:I agree! Ill be interested to see how the meeting with US president goes later this month. I don't think he is stable.  He assassinated his own half brother.  agent_2:I agree.   He caused terror in Hawaii without even actually sending a missile. The people who were in church during the threat message were told to repent and to end mass early. Some people began crying and praying. agent_1:I would have been worried as well.Kim was ranked the 46th most powerful person in the world in 2013! Thats  troublesome!  agent_2:Oh, wow. That is a weird fun fact, huh. I think Forbes ranked him that.	agent_1:Yep, you're right!

6431	agent_1:Hello! How are you today? agent_2:I'm doing well how about you? agent_1:Not too bad either! Do you play any instruments at all? agent_2:I do play the guitar. I heard that the piano is an acoustic instrument. agent_1:Oh really? I never knew that! I guess the strings are struck by hammers huh? agent_2:I guess so. Do you know who invented the piano? agent_1:Wasn't in by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700 in Italy? agent_2:That is correct. The piano is being playing using a keyboard that has a row of keys that the pianist presses down to cause the hammers to strike the strings. agent_1:That is one interesting fact! You know what is more interesting though, how computers have come about! agent_2:I agree. Computers are more complex than pianos in my opinion because they are devices that carry sequences by computer programming. agent_1:Well said! I wish I could have used a computer that used water to run it like the Russians did!	agent_2:Really!! I didn't know that the Russians did this.

10671	agent_1:Winter is getting old.  I'm ready to see birds migrating back north from Mexico; that would be a welcome sight. agent_2:Yea birds are pretty interesting, i find their light weight skeleton fascinating  agent_1:It's hard to believe that their skeletons actually weigh less than their feathers with those hollow bones. agent_2:Yea, they are quite successful species with over ten thousand species currently living agent_1:I guess some in Australia can mimic lots of sounds like cameras and chainsaws.  Listening to them might be better than going to a Creed concert.  Some dissatisfied listeners once filed a lawsuit since a performance was so bad. agent_2:I don't blame them. The foo fighters once did a concert so loud it was recorded on New Zealand's seismic monitors agent_1:Wow, that is loud!  But I'll bet it was fun.  I've never seen them live, but I have been to a few good amphitheatre shows: John Mellencamp, Tome, Petty, and KISS were really good. agent_2:Apparently Deep Purple has the record for loudest concert, it left three audience members unconscious agent_1:Holy cow, that had to be something.  Those classic acts had it going on.  The Ramones toured almost nonstop for 20 years; that is commitment to the craft, no doubt. agent_2:That is impressive, they've must of made a lot of money but probably not as much Abba was offered to do a reunion tour, they turned down 1 billion dollars agent_1:I did not know that.  For that kind of money, I think I could put grudges or reservations aside.  You could buy a lot of tacos for 1 billion dollars. agent_2:Yea I never even thought Abba was that in demand to offer 1 billion to do 100 concerts agent_1:I think I would pass on that one.  I didn't even know they were still all around.  Fame can take a toll on performers; Linkin Park was so awesome, but their lead singer faced demons and committed suicide.  So sad. agent_2:Yea that is unfortunate. Do you follow world events much. In 2010 there was a global tiger summit that russia pledged 330 million dollars to agent_1:I like keeping up on politics, but I did not know that fact.  However, I heard once that they gave out phone chargers and thumb drives infected with trojan viruses at one G20 summit.  That seems to go against the very nature of a summit. agent_2:Yes but I guess security is lacking at a lot of summits, in 2007 a man dressed as Osama bin Laden was able to get pass security of the Apec summit agent_1:Really?  You would think that security might be a bit tighter at these things.  Especially with the heads of state from so many powerful countries there.  It's almost like inviting someone to harm world leaders.   agent_2:Yea but I guess security is hard to do with the increase in Summits since the end of the Cold War agent_1:True, now there has been an increase in summit events since then, so it's probably harder to keep them all safe.   agent_2:Yea, they even have a summit on St Patrick's day where the Irish Prime Minister visits the US President agent_1:Really, that is cool.  That one is probably low stress compared to one with Putin or leaders from China.   agent_2:Yea, especially the early ones with FDR, Stalin and Chruchill during WWII	agent_1:It would have been amazing to witness those.  Those were three strong, influential, history-changing leaders.  	agent_2 likes history. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['history', 'money', 'billion dollars'].

Lucas' wife made such changes to the script that she won the Academy Award agent_2:Star Wars is the second highest grossing film series of all time. It's spawned into a bunch of other media like books, video games, theme parks. agent_1:Yeah it has certainly taken over everything. It was even dubbed in Navajo agent_2:Cool! James Cameron decided to quit being a truck driver so that he could enter the film industry after watching Star Wars. I guess that was the right decision.	agent_1:Oh for sure it was, the guy is a legend now.

9935	agent_1:Hi, how are you? agent_2:I'm good thanks. I was reading about tennis recently. Didier Drogba  is a soccer player that stopped a civil war in his home country.  agent_1:I read the other day that they have used helicopters to dry off the fields for tennis agent_2:Wow. It's really amazing what they will do for professional sports. And yet grunting in tennis can be considered cheating.  agent_1:Really? I think they do that like every hit! agent_2:The best players seem too. LOL! agent_1:Maybe it gives them an advantage! I know a black man won in 1968, and none have won since, that is odd agent_2:Was that Rodney Wallace's father? agent_1:I am not sure to be honest... I have also heard a tennis player invented the polo! agent_2:That makes me curious about who invented table tennis.  Apparently Ping Pong is the name of the company that sells table tennis equipment. It's not the name of the game. I was surprised when I heard that. agent_1:That is like the kleenex issue! Tennis is pretty much large scale ping pong! agent_2:Totally! Kleenex and Reynolds Wrap are brands that are so well known, their genre of products are known by the company name.  Kind of like Association Football is known just as football, even if it's not a part of the Association. agent_1:Apparently we call that soccer because it was slang for Association football! agent_2:Huh. I did not know that. I always wondered where the term soccer came from. agent_1:there also is a version of soccer where 3 teams play at once!	agent_2:Hmmm. If soccer players run an average of 7 miles per game, and they add a third team, I wonder, will that make them run closer to 10 miles?

11599	agent_1:I recently learned that the earth is the densest planet in the solar system.  I wonder if that helps it to support all of the water on it. agent_2:That is one possibility. Water is a very important resource that helps give life on earth. agent_1:Yes it does and the earth's surface is covered by about 71% of water.  The polar regions are covered in ice but that is just frozen water so-more water on the earth's surface. agent_2:That is true although I am not much into the science of earth. However I do appreciate the facts about the environment.  agent_1:Do you like planets in general?  Have you seen or noticed the five planets in the sky at night that can be seen by looking at them?	agent_2:I like planets. And yes I have been able to see them when they are noticeable. I love It when I can see the stars so bright and clear.

It was incredibly popular when I was younger.  agent_2:I never did, but someone once found 3 million dollars worth of cards in his grandfathers attic, what a come up! agent_1:WOW! Did you know Bestbuy and Target will price match Amazon?  agent_2:no i did not, but amazon is usually very competitive, so that is impressive! agent_1:Yeah, it is. Target apparently doesn't carry tobacco products.  agent_2:that is good, in my state no grocery store can sell alcohol agent_1:Wow, not surprising. Maryland used to have a law like that.  agent_2:I am around that area, so that makes a lot of sense. Vermont is the only state without a target believe it or not! agent_1:Interesting. Why is that?

I'm wondering is it only Japan, but any Asian country as well.  agent_1:Interesting, do you know if they play a championship game there? And if so, what is it called?>  agent_2:I have no idea. But if so, why US teams don't play aganst Japanese? lol It could the World Cup like in soccer/footaball every January 4 teams from different continents play 	agent_1:I don't know, curious why we call it a world series but the two countries never play each other. 	agent_2 likes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'baseball', 'Japan'].

Did you know that a married couple scheduled all 2430 games for 24 years until 2005? agent_1:Wow, that is pretty cool.  And no I didn't know that but that is very interesting.  I wonder how they ever got that job? agent_2:I don't know, but it must be complicated since there are sometimes concerts and other uses of stadiums.  Also, it's too cold in some ballparks early in the season.  There is a form of baseball played with a kickball in Canada. agent_1:Yeah that is true, the weather is unpredictable and some stadiums don't have roofs.  Yeah I think it is called soccer-baseball or something like that.  agent_2:It is odd that managers wear baseball uniforms.  Coaches in other sports don't wear uniforms. agent_1:Yeah it is odd, but do you know why they might wear uniforms unlike other sports? agent_2:I have read that they can actually enter the game but I am not sure that I believe it.   agent_1:Yeah that is right, technically they can play if they need to.  Wouldn't that be fun to watch your team's manager play and bat.  agent_2:Some would do well because they were recently players, but sometimes they are over 60 years old.

Long-time Yankee fan over here. agent_2:You probably won't like this but I'm Red Sox fan. I heard that Eric Hosmer signed with the San Diego Padres  for $144 million in an eight year contract. agent_1:Haha you're right I don't like the Red Sox. Yes I believe the Hosmer contract was last year. I think that's going to end up being a bad contract. agent_2:Me too. I think its too much money for a player that has proven himself. He is a 28 years old and he plays in the first base position and he did very well as a Royal. agent_1:By the end of that deal he will be in his mid to late 30's and nowhere ear as good. Definitely an overpay. Not as crazy as those Machado and Harper deals for over 300 million though. agent_2:No nothing like that. He has won 4 Gold Gloves in his career and I will like to see him in a Red Sox uniform. agent_1:That's true the Red Sox only weakness now is 1st base. Who's their starting, Mitch Moreland? agent_2:You are correct. I also heard that Hosmer will be making $20 million over each of the first 5 seasons with the Padres. agent_1:That's smart to front load it. It's crazy how much these guys get to play baseball. It's not even as physically demanding as football, basketball or hockey. agent_2:I agree with you completely. Those sports are way more physical than baseball. Did you know that the Dodgers have lost more world series championships than any other baseball team? agent_1:They've been around so long, it makes sense. I think they lost a lot of them to the Yankees. It's funny prior to the cubs just winning recently the last time they won before that the Ottoman Empire still existed.	agent_2:Ha Ha!!

I bet that is why they call them man's best friend.  agent_2:I guess so. They perform so many roles for humans, like hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, and companionship. I guess there's a reason why they are called that. They do a lot for humans. agent_1:Yeah. Apparently there are 12 different types of blood that a dog may have.  agent_2:I didn't know that. I wonder if they get good prizes at blood drives? agent_1:LOL, good question. Google prefers dogs to cats, did you know that?  agent_2:I did not know that. Did you know that Istanbul has vending machines with food and water for stray dogs in exchange for recycled plastic bottles. I think that's such a neat idea.  agent_1:No, I've never been to turkey.

8136	agent_1:Hi, how are you? Do you like jazz? agent_2:Hi there! Yeah I do like jazz! Do you? agent_1:Yes, I love jazz. I am listening to some right now.  agent_2:Ah nice! Yeah Jazz is interesting to me simply because it originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans. It's definitely rare and unique, in my opinion.  agent_1:It certainly is. I think that it should be more popular, but it is too artistic. Not enough show business, too much art. agent_2:Can you believe that Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts? Wow jazz has made it's way from New Orleans around the entire world! agent_1:Yes, even in Pakistan. I figure that there is value in all genres of music. Perhaps the rest of the world sees the value in jazz. agent_2:There certainly is value in all music, I agree! Which reminds me that I just recently heard that Clint Eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast, pianist, and he's scored several films, including Million Dollar Baby! agent_1:He seems like a tough guy, but he is an actor and artist so I'm not surprised. He is not a very good singer though. agent_2:Haha, then maybe I should be happy I've not heard him sing! So I was reading about how jazz trumpeters grew goatees to make playing a bit more comfortable. I wonder if that is possibly the origin of goatees. Maybe, maybe not! agent_1:He sang at the end of Gran Turino. I think people tried all kinds of facial hair, but for brass, maybe it's an obvious choice. agent_2:Hm. I did watch that movie but I just can't remember him singing! I'll check it out again, since now I'm pretty curious! :) agent_1:Right at the end. Then another singer takes over. Clint writes good melodies though.  agent_2:Interesting to be able to write melodies but not be able to sing so well! I pretty much have the opposite problem. Haha. Clint seems like such a new-age cowboy to me. Speaking of cowboys! The most popular hat in the old west was the bowler hat and not even the cowboy hat! agent_1:I guess the bowler was style and class and the cowboy hat was a working hat.  agent_2:Personally I prefer cowboy hats, especially since it's associated with hard work, instead of just sophistication and such. :)  agent_1:Yes, they have their own kind of cool. the bowler looks stuffy. agent_2:I agree! I prefer hates for functionality such as protecting against weather conditions, sun, and even beanie's for cold weather! Beanies are technically hats, right? agent_1:Yes, sure. But dont wear one to a wedding though! anyway, great chat! agent_2:Yeah thanks! It's been great! :) agent_1:You too! agent_2:Have a great day!

Lucas' wife made such changes to the script that she won the Academy Award agent_2:Star Wars is the second highest grossing film series of all time. It's spawned into a bunch of other media like books, video games, theme parks. agent_1:Yeah it has certainly taken over everything. It was even dubbed in Navajo agent_2:Cool! James Cameron decided to quit being a truck driver so that he could enter the film industry after watching Star Wars. I guess that was the right decision. agent_1:Oh for sure it was, the guy is a legend now. James Earl Jones got only $7500 recording Darth Vader's lines agent_2:Crazy! Fox thought Star Wars was going to flop and agreed to George Lucas's proposition to forgo an extra $500K directing fee so that he could keep licensing and merchandising rights. Their decision cost them billions of dollars agent_1:Yeah and at the same time made Lucas a billionaire. He just had a lot of confidence in his work agent_2:Yeah, in 2018 the whole Star Wars franchise was estimated at $65 billion agent_1:That is insane. Do you watch the Academy Awards? agent_2:No, I don't. How about you? agent_1:I watch it sometimes. Did you know Daniel Day-Lewis has won the Oscar 3 times? agent_2:I am not sure I even know who he is. Good for him. John Williams has been nominated for more Oscars than anyone besides Walt Disney. agent_1:Yeah Disney is going to be hard to reach by anyone else with 22 Oscars agent_2:He got a special Oscar in 1938 for snow white that had a regular sized statuette and seven miniature oscars. 	agent_1:That is amazing.

I wonder how many people had TV then? agent_1:Good question.  Freddie mercury used the same piano to record bohemian rhapsody as paul mccartney used to record hey jude agent_2:cool! ever hears of Eurovision? agent_1:No, what's that? agent_2: Song Contest in england. agent_1:Oh ok.  In 2006 a group of climbers reached the top of britain's highest mountain and found a piano agent_2:neat! apparently the competition away from its usual reliance on over-the-top spectacle. agent_1:An aluminum grand piano was built for the lounge of the airship hindenburg. it weighed only 356 pounds. agent_2:Wow! I did not know that! Portuguese broadcaster RTP had stripped the Eurovision stage of the walls of LED screens that have become ubiquitous backdrops in recent years. agent_1:When eddie van halen recorded the guitar solo for ""beat it"" he literally set the studio speakers on fire. agent_2:Oh my gosh! DO you like Jazz? agent_1:No, not really.  You? agent_2:Some, but Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans. agent_1:There is a programming language in which the programs are written in musical composition, and functional programs have jazz-like harmonies. agent_2:I had no idea! Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, agent_1:A harlem woman has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every sunday for 20 years. top performers occasionally stop by. agent_2:Thats neat! New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation."	agent_1:Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts.	agent_2 likes music. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'music genre', 'Jazz'].
7897	agent_1:Hi, do you like baseball? agent_2:Yes, I grew up in St. Louis in the 70's so I used to love the Cardinals, KC in the 90-00's so a big Royals fan and I've been in Boston for 4 years so I have enjoyed local baseball in all three towns. Are you a fan?  I knew that managers wear uniforms in the dugout because they can technically play and there were player-managers in the old days, but when the last time a manager actually played in a game? agent_1:Hi, yes I like baseball , and sports in general....and is true I have never seen a manager playing!! but is good they are ready in case they are needed! agent_2:It's funny baseball is so popular in Japan that many fans don't know it was America's pastime. I guess they forgot WW II, it was brought there by occupying US Troops after Japan surrendered.  agent_1:Wow that is impressive, they kind of ignored how americans feel about baseball.. i think the Chicago cubs have not won in a long time! agent_2:Yes, first team to win back-to-back World Series and not another one for 108 years (Ottoman Empire was still in existence when they last won a World Series?), that ironic. As a St. Louis fan growing up I did go to quite a few games at Wrigley Field along the way before they  had lights which made a good afternoon. As I have a lot of Cub fan friends that World Series win was quite something, though many of them felt relief instead of happiness after the win. agent_1:That is really cool history right there. Would be nice to see a win from the cubs again. Do you know what a very lucky man found in his grandfather's attic? agent_2:You mean the $3 Million dollar baseball card collection? Yes, I collected and bought some rare cards at a shop and know have no idea where they album are, a luck garbage collector might have found them when my mom cleaned out the attic long after I moved out. Being in Red Sox land, there's always the ghost of Babe Ruth, when you look at the big guy he doesn't look fleet of foot, bunny he lost the '26 World series getting caught trying to steal home down by one run. Funny thought, though I doubt Yankee fans thought that , that year. agent_1:wow, you collected those too!  I am amazed those cards lasted hidden since the 1940's!! agent_2:Yes, I think every kid 1940-19808 probably did. You see where in the '92 World Series the US Marine Corp color guard carried the flag upside down, I wonder if that was planned to psyche them out or distract them from the game plan or totally an accident?	agent_1:I would be funny if it was an accident..

I've had cockatiels, parakeets, and some fancier parrots when I was a kid.

It's estimated that over 1.5 million living animal species have been described. agent_1:That is a lot. What is your favorite animal? agent_2:Hahah my favorite animals are frogs.  Been fascinated with them ever since I was a kid for some reason. agent_1:Interesting! Did you know under provisions of the 1912 Scottish protection of animals act the lochness monster is a protected species? hahaha	agent_2:That's funny!  The Netherlands is constructing special bridges for wildlife in order to connect habitats and keep animals from being hit by cars.  That's a good idea.  In the fall where I live the roads are peppered with dead animals.

A black man won the first US open tennis title back in 1968 and no black man has won it since. agent_2:Wow! Over 50 years and still holding the record! I think the next year in 1969 they used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the US open. agent_1:I agree. They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US open. agent_2:Yes, they did. The longest tennis match went on for 11 hours over three days.

10961	agent_1:Good Afternoon!  I love going to concerts, seeing my favorite bands, music live - how about you? agent_2:Hello, I do as well though I don't get to go often. I have been to a few recitals in my day too. agent_1:I used to go to shows a lot more that I do now, kids and family will have that affect!  And, I like smaller venues - definitely not areas or stadiums! agent_2:I prefer smaller settings as well though I would love to attend a concert in an amphitheater. In Croatia there is a roman amphitheater that they still use as a concert venue. agent_1:Nice!  Europe has so much history and the engineering / architecture was so great, that doesn't surprise me that a venue would still be in use - amazing! agent_2:True. In 72, Pink Floyd recorded a live concert at the amphitheater in Pompeii with no audience at all. agent_1:That's strange - makes me wonder if you play a concert for no audience - is it really a concert? agent_2:Good question. Are you a fan of Creed's music? Four people at one of their concerts in 2002 sued them because it was so bad. Yikes! agent_1:I am not a Creed fan, or that genre.  So I can totally understand why fans would be disappointed enough to sue - but honestly, what were they expecting?!!?!?!? agent_2:I guess the opposite of that would be Linkin Park who played 324 concerts just in 2001. They were definitely a success back in the day. agent_1:Pretty sure I was at at least one of those LP shows in '01.  It's a shame that the lead singer is gone, he was from around here... agent_2:How cool! Have you heard of the Ramones? Apparently they toured almost 20 years non stop. agent_1:Of course - a little before my time, but very influential in the Rock/Punk Rock scene.  Ramones kinda started the live rock scene in NYC - or at least were the kings of it for some time agent_2:Wow, I had never heard of them. Do you play any musical instruments? Piano/violin? agent_1:I do not - you mentioned that you had been to recitals in the past.  What type of recitals / instruments were featured? agent_2:I had a few friends who were music majors in college. I attended a lot of piano recitals mainly. Einstein was a musician as well and played the piano and violin very well. agent_1:Interesting!  I began to enjoy piano composers later in life, not sure why exactly.  Chopin and Vivaldi are some of my favorites! agent_2:A friend of mine in Cali has a baby grand in her house. They had to use a crane to get it in their house and also remove a whole glass wall on one side of the house. Course not as big as the grand piano built on the airship Hindenburg. agent_1:Fascinating - they had a grand piano on the Hindenburg?

I do not play any more though. how often do you play? agent_2:I play in the summers we play a couple times a week, we play this game called pickleball a lot too its similar to tennis, did you hear that in 1969 they used helicopters to dry off the grass tennis courts, thats funny  agent_1:I had no idea. I am in parks and recreation and pickleball is a huge sport for us. At least compared to some other sports.  agent_2:ah nice have you ever played? its more action packed and easier than tennis I think agent_1:I have not but it does look fun.

Disney released the first trailer for next year for the Lion King remake. agent_2:That's correct. Disney is calling the new Lion King remake a live action film but it relies almost exclusively on CGI so a lot of people consider it annimation. agent_1:I do too. A related debate arose when Avatar was released, with the Visual Effects Society honoring James Cameron's 2009 epic for, among other trophies, animated character in a live-action feature motion picture agent_2:I agree that these kinds of films are skirting the line between traditional annimation and heavily CGI assisted live action films. With the improvements in the technology I'm not sure it makes sense anymore to feel the need to classify such films in the traditional modes. agent_1:Yeah I feel the same way of course Jon Favreau, the director of the Lion King remake has naturally walked down this valley before, with his update of The Jungle Book.  agent_2:Yes, the difference being that the Jungle Book still had a human character and therefore a true live action person was seen on screen. The Lion King contains no humans and so it is likely that everything is CGI. agent_1:Technology is all consuming. During the 70s, disney recycled a lot of their animation frames, resulting in identical scenes in some movies agent_2:That was a different time, generating those frames took so long that it made sense to recycle those that you could. Creation is a much quicker process now with the aid of computer programs. agent_1:Did you know that Frozen was the first animated Disney film directed by a woman. agent_2:Yes I had heard that. Disney does a good job trying to increase representation in their films and parks when possible. They also dubbed the Lion King into Zulu for its African release. agent_1:Makes sense i wasnt at all surprised when Disney acquired Marvel.  agent_2:I was.

It was a couple who did it for 24 years in a row agent_1:Wow, the must really love baseball!  That is a lot of time dedicated to the sport,  that is really sweet that they had something they were both passionate about though.  agent_2:Exactly because scheduling 2430 games every year is no easy feat	agent_1:I know right!

It's obviously much bigger in Canada than here though. I know the U.S. Olympic Women's team lost to a New England high school team once. agent_1:ya Canada is really good, I guess one year at the Olympics they scored 132 goals and only let in 3! agent_2:God I can't imagine the other team's disappointment. That must be how Bulgaria felt when their women's team lost to Slovakia 82-0.   agent_1:that is crazy, are you a dog or a cat person? agent_2:I'm definitely more of a dog person, and yourself? agent_1:yes I like dogs a lot more, did you know that Google is officially a pro-dog company? haha agent_2:Wow, I wonder how they even chose that!

Jeff Bezos certainly has vision agent_1:Yes, it's crazy that they started out as an online bookstore and now it's so big it's the largest internet retailer in the world agent_2:They even own imdb! agent_1:I guess it makes sense that once they had that property, they'd move into streaming video and producing their own content with Amazon Studios agent_2:They certianly have capitalized off their success, even getting USPS to deliver packages on sunday agent_1:Yes, and their own workers move a lot of packages, too. A warehouse workers walks between 7 and 15 miles over the course of a daily shift. agent_2:That seems like a lot, I wonder how soon before they start replacing them with AI? agent_1:It's only a matter of developing the technology to a point where the automation is cheaper. There is actually a non-profit organization for the advancement on AI, I wonder what kind of people contribute to that! agent_2:Facebook is even in on the development of AI, trying to understand human emotion, and predict user actions.  It is almost there with the fact when you search for something you start to see ads for it on Facebook.  Re-targeting as become amazing that way agent_1:Yes, we're at the point where tasks like OCR are often excluded from AI because they've become such a routine technology. agent_2:I personally am excited to see further development in the self driving car type of technology. agent_1:I love driving, so I'm not personally excited to use that, but I think it's better than dealing with all of the distracted drivers on the road because they're looking at their phones. Google actually calculates traffic using the movement of Android devices on the road! agent_2:I didn't know that.  Thats pretty cool, I was wondering how they got that info, I knew it couldn't be just people logged on to maps. agent_1:Yes, I guess you have to watch what you agree to!

Ive heard Kristen Stewart co-authored a paper on AI agent_1:That seems a bit ironic haha. Maybe she took Stanford's free class on AI that uses Google Plus Hangouts and shared her lovely personality. agent_2:Lol.

Kayne West I heard that he believes AIDS is a man made disease. huh? agent_1:really ? I think something is wrong with that man agent_2:Yeah, odd thinking.

Oh boy he truly know about his future may be he was feeling dejavu agent_2:Yeah, good point. Out of the top 10 most successful songs of all time is one of his actually. agent_1:pretty much unbelievable may be he should save his talent only for music and avoid talk shows agent_2:Thats some sound advice!

It might be like an embarrassment to the team to have to bring in a manager like that, though. What do you think? agent_1:haha ya I would think so, can you believe that baseball is super popular in Japan, I had no idea agent_2:Yea, when I worked for Target a few years ago I remember they'd have Japanese baseball on in the break room along with other TV's with American Sports. agent_1:ah that is interesting, I wish I was like the guy who found millions of dollars of baseball cards in his attic, now that would be a surprise agent_2:As long as I'm not like the guy found in a beer cooler behind a concession stand at a baseball stadium. He was found just before a braves game, too. agent_1:ya I heard about that that was crazy, did you ever play kickball as a kid? I guess it's called soccer-baseball in canada agent_2:Canadians do have some different ways about them. Soccer-baseball does sound hilarious. So does poutine, though. agent_1:haha well I do like poutine, but I think that yes soccer-baseball sounds incredibly dumb haha agent_2:I wonder if they have poutine at American baseball games? I heard they started a poutine restaurant in California. agent_1:wow that sounds delicious right now, do you ever shop at Target btw? agent_2:I like Target better than Walmart, although I don't know about the corporations as a whole and how they do business. I hear more about Walmart being unfair...don't really ever hear that about Target but who knows, I guess...	agent_1:ya I don't really know, I do go to target and apparently Vermont is the only state that doesn't have a Target in it	agent_2 dislikes shopping. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['shopping', 'sports', 'baseball'].

But, I feel kind of like Stephen Hawking, it's dangerous to be communicating with them. agent_1:But what if people like stephan hawking understood things we dont' he is on another level of intelligence kind of like elon musk they are the human versions of aliens with their brains agent_2:I agree with you about that.  If we found some aliens, I'd say let's watch them for a good long time before any attempts at communication and they probably feel the same way about communicating with us. agent_1:Exactly if aliens wanted to harm us they could have easily already have done it, they don't want to interfere with us we shouldn't interfere with them agent_2:I agree, there's something to it, though when the UN has a contigency plan in place should aliens ever attempt to contact the Earth.  So, somebody knows something, they just can't alert the masses and create panic around the world. agent_1:So true and don't you find it wierd how drones were first military technology and then a couple of years later it becomes available to the public.

By voting.   agent_2:Do you know the difference between the United States Senate and House of Representatives? agent_1:One difference is 2 per state for the Senate while the House has 435 districts.  Those who are elected call the people who are represented ""constituents"" agent_2:Yes, and the Senate is considered more prestigious  and more deliberative. They're both important in for presidential votes, I think. agent_1:Yes.   The senate has certain rules where 60 votes are required for many bills.  I think that forces more deliberatioin.  They used the same gavel for 155 years until Richard Nixon cracked it. agent_2:The only fun think I've learned about the Senate is that they started the candy desk tradition. I remember my teachers always had candy drawers in their desks. agent_1:I have one in my office too.  One needs supplements if your blood sugar drops for no good reason.  Apparently Pennsylvania is the source of the candy right now. agent_2:Was that because of the Hershey factory there? Did you know they let astronauts vote from outer space? I think that's a good thing. agent_1:The astronaut voting sends a strong message about how important voting is.  I like that too.  For some reason, the candies are Mars bars and Milky Way rather than Hershey. agent_2:I'd think they'd have expensive candies from local shops. I wonder why the Senate used to have a rule that women were not allowed to wear pants until after 1993? agent_1:I suspect that women set the dress code in years past so they would look professional. Michael Jordan would not endorse a democrat because ""republicans buy shoes too"" agent_2:I heard that about Jordan but I really didn't understand what he meant. I also don't understand why Republicans started out with ideals more like Democrats today and then switched.  agent_1:Jordan has his own line of shoes made by Nike.  It is a separate brand and he does not want to offend almost half of the market.  But the GOP has always been small government and low regulations. agent_2:I get it now! Well, Jordan was smart for that as far as business goes, it seems. It's also interesting to me how the Republicans are associated with red and Democrats with blue. agent_1:Yes.  I remember one election where one network had those colors reversed.  But the color code is solidly established now."	agent_2:It seems like it's been so since long before 2000, but that's the year it started, I guess. I think it's funny that Truman wouldn't be photographed on a Dumbo ride as to not be associated with Republicans.	agent_1 likes transportation. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['transportation', 'politics', 'no'].

Did You hear that Bruce lee was also a great dancer and he won the hong kong cha-cha championship in 1958 ? agent_2:I did hear that.  Emilia clarke did the funky chicken and robot dance at the audition for daenerys targaryen. agent_1:I am such a big fan of hers!  agent_2:Did you know that there was an episode of mr. rogers where he learned to breakdance agent_1:I would love to see that. Did You see a movie about him ? I've heard it's good. agent_2:No, I haven't seen it but watched his show growing up. agent_1:I'm from Poland and I got here like 16 years ago... I've never seen it but I admire who he is and what he did... agent_2:That's cool.  I've never been to Poland.  There are ballet slippers that make drawings from the dancer's movements	agent_1:Probably looks like a 2year old drawing :)	agent_2 likes hobby. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobby', 'travel', 'Poland'].
1654	agent_1:How's it going, do you watch Horror films? The first ones were inspired by Edgar Allan Poe and Mary Shelley agent_2:I love horror movies, I am a stephen king fan! agent_1:It's kinda strange Stephen King considers bambi a horror movie agent_2:Right, it must have made him so scared as a kid. I think about the shining sometimes, good movie. The boy in the movie didnt know it was a horror movie until years later agent_1:I'm surprised the boy from the shinning couldn't figure out he was in a horror movie from the scenes with the bloody elevator and creepy twins agent_2:right, or the guy breaking down the door. I wonder how the movie was at the box office	agent_1:Probably pretty scary, apparently you can burn more than 180 calories watching a horror movie	agent_2 likes movie. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'movies', 'movie genre'].
9912	agent_1:did you know between 9pm -12 am netflix accounts for a third of the bandwidth in north america agent_2:I can believe that. My son watches movies all the time along with TV shows and Netflick originals. He got me hooked on Stranger Things. agent_1:a guy racked up $40 in late fees on a vhs so he started netflix agent_2:I remember the days of rentals. What a pain that was. Now we sit at home and just stream everything. I still like to get Netflix dvds cause I don't understand how to stream. My son laughs at me. agent_1:well apparently netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth so maybe you aren't the only one! agent_2:Yes, there's a lot of us old fogeys around. I liked them better before they changed their homepage. I find it very hard to find films anymore.Amazing that they are almost totally world-wide. agent_1:I agree. I hate the new set up. I didnt realalize netflix started its own content in 2012. I thought it was much more recent than that agent_2:Well at first I'm sure everyone thought that their self production shows would be like Japanese sci-fi films, not worth watching. but some of their shows are very highly rated. agent_1:do you like star wars? james earl jones only spent 2.5 hours recording all of darth vaders lines and was paid $7500 i cant decide if that was a lot or a little in the 70s agent_2:It was low for voice actors then but he certainly made the character more evil than anyone else could have. That series has made so many people rich. Especially George Lucas. agent_1:in 2018 the total value for the star wars franchise was $65 BILLION. Thats insane agent_2:Yes and that launched the career of many people, the most notable being Han Solo. The acting in the first was atrocious but got better as more movies were made. All told a great movie. agent_1:I think its great that george lucas' wife marcia won an academy award for editing while george didn't win any for directing agent_2:He got his through notoriety. I think everyone knows his name. Some of the lingo has worked it's way into our language. Did you know that watching that movie was what made James Cameron go into directing?	agent_1:I did not know that. In the original transformers movie there are 1.53 explosions per minute lol.

I still can synthesize my own vitamin C. agent_1:How is your hearing? agent_2:Hearing is pretty good. Like most humans, I have excellent distant running abilities. Well, maybe I used to. agent_1:There is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans! That seems weird... agent_2:I think it's 13 hertz, very low, below our threshold of hearing. Causes fear because I think it's like an earthquake sound. agent_1:Reallly??? That's impressive knowledge! Do you know anything about ribs agent_2:I've read that they grow back stronger after they get broken, but I haven't tested that out myself. agent_1:Yeah. I know if you smoke them with BBQ sauce for 2 hours on 180 they are delicious... agent_2:That a good tip, but they probably won't heal well after that.  agent_1:No, I am not good for the healing portion of ribs. I am on the other side of the healing line. I wonder how many ribs a black swallower fish can eat... agent_2:Times times their weight? They would get kicked out of the smorgasbord. agent_1:Yeah! They would do some damage... I wonder how they would consume water? agent_2:I don't know whether they are freshwater or saltwater fish.  agent_1:That would make the difference. I kknow they do not have necks... agent_2:The humble seahorse is the only fish to have a neck. But it's not immortal! agent_1:Is there anything that is immortal, besides Hulk Hogan? agent_2:There is a breed of jellyfish that's immortal.

7895	agent_1:Hi, do you like baseball? agent_2:Yes, I grew up in St. Louis in the 70's so I used to love the Cardinals, KC in the 90-00's so a big Royals fan and I've been in Boston for 4 years so I have enjoyed local baseball in all three towns. Are you a fan?  I knew that managers wear uniforms in the dugout because they can technically play and there were player-managers in the old days, but when the last time a manager actually played in a game? agent_1:Hi, yes I like baseball , and sports in general....and is true I have never seen a manager playing!! but is good they are ready in case they are needed! agent_2:It's funny baseball is so popular in Japan that many fans don't know it was America's pastime. I guess they forgot WW II, it was brought there by occupying US Troops after Japan surrendered.  agent_1:Wow that is impressive, they kind of ignored how americans feel about baseball.. i think the Chicago cubs have not won in a long time! agent_2:Yes, first team to win back-to-back World Series and not another one for 108 years (Ottoman Empire was still in existence when they last won a World Series?), that ironic. As a St. Louis fan growing up I did go to quite a few games at Wrigley Field along the way before they  had lights which made a good afternoon. As I have a lot of Cub fan friends that World Series win was quite something, though many of them felt relief instead of happiness after the win. agent_1:That is really cool history right there. Would be nice to see a win from the cubs again. Do you know what a very lucky man found in his grandfather's attic? agent_2:You mean the $3 Million dollar baseball card collection? Yes, I collected and bought some rare cards at a shop and know have no idea where they album are, a luck garbage collector might have found them when my mom cleaned out the attic long after I moved out. Being in Red Sox land, there's always the ghost of Babe Ruth, when you look at the big guy he doesn't look fleet of foot, bunny he lost the '26 World series getting caught trying to steal home down by one run. Funny thought, though I doubt Yankee fans thought that , that year.	agent_1:wow, you collected those too!

1678	agent_1:Good Morning! Do you like to watch horror films? agent_2:Hi, how are you? I am not really a fan of the genre, though I have some favorites. agent_1:What are some of your favorite ones? Stephen king considers Bambi one haha. agent_2:King was just a kid, to be fair. That movie could be scary to a tiny child. He then turned his fright into a profession. agent_1:You're right on that one. Did you know you can burn 180 calories watching one? agent_2:I suppose that I could try to lose weight that way. It might be easier to exercise. I like a couple of films, but after the first viewing, they are not as scary. agent_1:Just do a marathon one day of watching them and you'll be set. Have you seen the Shining? The boy actor didn't even know it was a horror film until years later. agent_2:I liked the Shining. King wrote a great story and it translated well to the screen. I am surprised by the kid though. What did he think it was? agent_1:That is a good question. You would think watching the cinematography alone would let you know it was one! agent_2:I wonder if he ever saw the film while he was a kid. I think maybe his parents wouldn't let him. 	agent_1:That could be it!

Do you like them?	agent_2:Some of them seem more like common sense to me.

11832	agent_1:Do you shop at LL Bean? agent_2:Yes, I do.  I wondered when they would stop their lifetime refund guarantee.  People nowadays are just plain crooked. agent_1:I was only just made aware of that offer.  There are always people willing to exploit a system like that. agent_2:But, to go as far as to buy things at a yard sale and try to return them, that's just taking it to a new level of exploitation.  A crook will always be a crook, for sure! agent_1:This kind of promise works well in a small group, but once it goes national you lose the personal connection, and some will exploit it. agent_2:How true.  On a side note, do you own any UGG boots?	agent_1:Not my style.

Did you know from 9pm-12am, Netflix accounts for 33% of all the bandwidth in North America? agent_2:Holy cow, that is so much bandwidth during those peak hours.  agent_1:I agree. Netflix and YouTube make up half of the peak internet traffic in North America. agent_2:That is crazy, and I think it will even continue to grow in the future.  agent_1:Netflix is worth $2 billion right now. agent_2:Wow, I think back in 2000, they proposed to Blockbuster that it should use Netflix as it's online service, they laughed at the offer.  agent_1:I bet lol. Netflix was started due to a $40 late fee incurred by Reed Hastings. agent_2:Yeah old Reed didn't like those late fees, look what happened since then.  agent_1:Do you like Tom Cruise? agent_2:Yeah I do, I really like 80's Tom Cruise movies.  How about you? agent_1:Me too. I love Top Gun. agent_2:Yeah Top Gun was one of his best for sure, I always like risky business.  agent_1:Tom Cruise once threatened Tom Kruse who is the inventory of the hoverboard. agent_2:I heard that!  I think he should have just endorsed it and gone along with it. agent_1:I agree. Tom Cruise spent two years learning Japanese and swordplay in preparation for a film. agent_2:That is dedication, I have always admired him for his acting skills. 	agent_1:Me too.

Now the franchise of Star Wars is estimated to be worth $65 billion. agent_2:I'm glad 20th century fox finally decided to jump on board with them! My mind is blown, George Lucas says the entire story is told by r2d2!	agent_1:Wow I never knew that. Star Wars is the second highest grossing film series of all time. I wonder what the first one is?

Some of them can be cool though, like that poem that when read normally is depressing and vice versa agent_2:there is a 274 line poem called the chaos, i am assuming becaus it has irregularly pronounced words agent_1:I would assume so too. THe Javanese alphabet too, if recited in order it forms a poem agent_2:the vikings were warrior poets. lol what the heck? did they just shout poetry at the enemy ? agent_1:Hahaha maybe that is how they fought. Allan Poe received only $9 for his poem The Raven.

Lol. Did you know that nevada is the only state to have a none of these candidates option while voting?  agent_2:I guess it's nice to have that option, especially if you have one one your really don't want to vote for, for example, someone who doesn't exactly agree with history textbooks.	agent_1:On a funnier note. President truman in 1957 refused to have his picture taken with dumbo because he didnt want to be associated with republicans.

8200	agent_1:Hello did you know the only fish to have a neck is the seahorse? agent_2:I never thought about it but that is interesting! I am kind of frightened that there is a breed of jelly fish that are immortal. Yikes! agent_1:And lobster!  They are immortal in a sense that their organs dont age,  so as long as nothing kills them they can technically live forever.  agent_2:Yuck. I don't like that at all. One of the most interesting fish is the balck swallower fish that can eat prey twice its own length and ten times its weight. Sounds like one of those creepy snakes that eat huge animals. agent_1:Yuck?  Ah you dont like seadfood?  I love eating lobster lol I think that fish black swallow is amazing,  to have the ability to have their body stretch like that,  who knows when their next meal will come along.  agent_2:I am allergic to shellfish...maybe that is it. But can you believe this...  I named my son Fisher. So there is a little love there! agent_1:oh thats too bad, sorry to hear.  Haha Fisher,  thats a great name.  Freshwater fish drink water through their skin! agent_2:Interesting! I just learned that there are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth. Crazy! agent_1:Yeah and they are not even all discovered yet!  theres a bunch undiscovered animals and insects in the amazon rainforest still.  agent_2:The rainforest frightens me. Too many creatures! I can only imagine how many insects are in there!  Did you know that animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated? agent_1:I didnt.  I guess I would never notice because my dog is white lol agent_2:That is funny. My dog has a white patch ...but not on it's forehead!  They say that hiccups are a holdover from early evolution when early land animals had gills and lungs. agent_1:I kinda wish we still had gills lol That would be sweet to swim longer under water.  agent_2:I agree! Look...I love my sleep but there are some birds who fly from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping when migrating. Exhausting! agent_1:I know right, thats incredible.  I also love sleeping.  agent_2:Naps are the best! I like that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. Where do you think they hide it? agent_1:The hummingbirds?  I have no clue lol Where do they hide? agent_2:No!  I was asking where they hide the spiderweb when they are stealing it.  I was trying to be funny.  Didn't work!  LOL!  One fact is that birds bones are so hollow that the entire skeleton weighs less than the feathers! agent_1:Oh lol  Thats horrible, i wouldnt want hollow bones lol I guess it makes sense for them,  they have to be light enough to fly  agent_2:True! Good point! In Australia there are wild birds that can mimic the sound of cameras, car alarms and chainsaws! Creepy!	agent_1:wow that is really creepy!

Can you play the piano? agent_2:I can play some, I have an electric piano that I keep plugged in in my room. agent_1:Thats really cool, I can play a bit, but spend more time with other instruments.  Did you know Freddie Mercury used the same piano for Bohemian Rhapsody that McCartney used for Hey Jude in the recording studio? agent_2:That's really cool. I wish the news would play piano instead of news these days like they did back in 1930. agent_1:I know. It would be far better than the slanted views they all put out today.  Id actually enjoy that. agent_2:Do you like Amazon? I have Amazon prime video and it with Netflix is all I really use for tv these days. agent_1:I love amazon!  Love how quickly they can get things out, even on sundays agent_2:Maybe I should get a job in one of the Amazon warehouses, sounds like a good idea to lose some extra weight since they walk 7 to 15 miles per day! agent_1:That might be a good gig for me too, trying to up my step game.   agent_2:I would love to visit the clock in the mountain that Jeff Bezos had built. agent_1:That would be cool.  It is going to run for 10,000 years so youve got time. agent_2:So how do you feel about snakes? I have a pet king snake myself, and I love them. agent_1:I dont think I could own one, but Im not scared or anything.  Did you know there are No Snakes in New Zealand. agent_2:Yeah that's pretty crazy. The only bad thing about owning a snake is the upkeep, it can get expensive. agent_1:I bet, is your snake one of the ones that flies? agent_2:Haha no, king snakes can not do that, if they could I am not sure I would want to own one, they sound very dangerous. agent_1:Where I live a giant cobra escaped and was loose in the city. agent_2:Well I hope someone caught it before someone killed it, You cant punish them for doing what is hard wired into them. agent_1:They never found it.  Dead or alive.  Yeah, I have a friend who is seriously afraid of snakes, runs away from the smallest ones.	agent_2:I don't have a fear of snakes, but spiders on the other hand I almost can not stand them to even be near me, hate the little buggers.	agent_1 likes hobbies. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobbies', 'music', 'instruments'].

Which is album is that concert for? agent_1:I'm not actually sure. I will have to look that up. But he played a lot of past songs too. agent_2:Oh! I think the album is actually called Man in the Woods. I don't think it was as good as his earlier stuff. I only really remember Say Something from this new album. agent_1:Yeah. Well I think it's safe to say he has come a long way since Mickey Mouse Club! agent_2:Have you seen any of the movies he's been in? agent_1:Yeah I saw the one about facebook which I thought was good. He is a good actor but I think he should stick to pop music. Ricky Gervais was a pop singer oddly enough.	agent_2:I can't remember the name of the movie I saw him but Cameron Diaz and Jason Segal were in it too. It was pretty good. I can't imagine Ricky Gervais singing at all! He's hilarious though.	agent_1 likes movie. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'music', 'songs'].

I didn't realize they own IMDB as well! agent_2:I know, I didn't either!  Thinking the amazon warehouse workers don't need a gym membership with walking 7-15 miles each day on a shift! Omg! agent_1:I would be the fittest man alive working there haha. They ought to use horses there! Especially Icelandic horses that can speedwalk!	agent_2:Ha, ha, ha, Yes!!

So you are one of those that make up using all that bandwidth during peak hours lol.  agent_1:I am a part of that group, yes, lol, its also YouTubes fault as they together with netflix they take upon half of the internet traffic agent_2:Yeah I can totally see that, YouTube is so popular among younger people it's crazy to me.  agent_1:It is really popular, just like Netflix is, its amazing how the service has 137 million subscribers around the globe agent_2:And that number is still growing, thats so many.  But, it is quality stuff, you get access to an insane amount of content.  agent_1:I agree, you get more than what you pay for, I used to spend a lot of money on rentals and those late fees were a real pain to pay agent_2:Yeah I think that is why Hastings started the company in the first place, he was in your same shoes.  agent_1:Could be, so he must hate Star Wars then, do you like the franchise? agent_2:Yeah I grew up watching the movies years ago when I was a kid, I still think the ones from the late 70's/early 80's are the best ones.  How about you? agent_1:I do too, I think old movies are the best ones, I love Star Wars personally, I dont like the new movies as much though, 	agent_2:Yeah I'm the same way when it comes to that.  It is hard to replicate, and I know the Star Wars fans are so hardcore and hard to please as well!	agent_1 dislikes movie. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'social media', 'time of use'].

I had no idea he was in the marines!  The greek that comedy was two groups against one another in an amusing conflict. agent_2:yup, comedy is cool it was founded in ancient Greece which I didnt know agent_1:It's got to be hard to do too.

Netflix and YouTube make up half of the peak internet traffic in North America. agent_2:That is crazy, and I think it will even continue to grow in the future.  agent_1:Netflix is worth $2 billion right now. agent_2:Wow, I think back in 2000, they proposed to Blockbuster that it should use Netflix as it's online service, they laughed at the offer. 	agent_1:I bet lol.

I hope not though. agent_1:Soon we will run out of helium. Earth will be virtually helium-free by the end of the 21st century. Where will it all go? agent_2:I know, where?

Fox News once tried to sue to get the show to stop parodying them.  agent_1:I love the Simpsons! not so much Fox news though, they deserve to parodied agent_2:They practically ARE a parody! Do you remember their version of the Daily show from 2007? Man, it was terrible. Really, really terrible. It was canceled after 13 episodes.  agent_1:with Jon Stewart? the one on Comedy Central? agent_2:Yeah, fox tried to copy it with their own show called the Half Hour News Hour.  agent_1:oh I thought you were saying The Daily Show was bad and got cancelled! yea Fox should not have copied that show. Did you know Fox News and IGN are owned by the same company? agent_2:I did not know that. But I'm sure Rupert Murdoch owns dozens of companies I don't know about. Another thing I didn't know -- Hillary Clinton was the president of the You ng Republicans in college.  agent_1:wow! her views sure have shifted a lot since then, huh/	agent_2:I'd say.

13552	agent_1:Hello.   What do you think of Pluto-planet or not? agent_2:If it were up to me it would be a planet. Seems silly to deem it otherwise. agent_1:I agree.  I don't like how the parameters for what is a planet and what isn't is determined by where and what they orbit. agent_2:Yeah but humans are a weird species, they have laws and rules for everything agent_1:True.  Look at Jupiter's moon Ganymede.  If it orbited the sun it would be a planet by definition. agent_2:Yeah and there is also a planet that orbits 4 stars, that's crazy. agent_1:I wonder how that works. I guess the stars are close together?   agent_2:Maybe, but they would have to be far enough apart so they are not affected by each others gravity fields yet be able to influence the planet that is orbiting them. agent_1:That's true.  So that would mean a very large galaxy.  What do you think of the planet where shards of glass precipitate sidewys at 4500 mph in 2000 degree fahrenheit weather? agent_2:Man that would be scary, imagine is it started raining glass on earth, we would be screwed. agent_1:Yes we would.  For something odd closer to home we've got Venus with it's no seasons. agent_2:Do you play video games? I play probably way more than I should haha. agent_1:I do play some. I play more on my phone nowadays though.  It's said that we play three billion hours of video games a week. agent_2:I mainly play on pc and I play a ton of a game called League of Legends, I have over 4k hours, pretty crazy how addicting games can be. agent_1:That's for sure.  I have to say though that I don't agree with some people that games are an art form.	agent_2:it really depends on the game, for it to be art it really needs to stand out, but really games are not more art than a movie is.	agent_1 dislikes movie. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'astronomy', 'horoscope'].
6615	agent_1:I guess a disabled student who won a case against a TX school died recently.  Her name is Amber Tatro. agent_2:Yeah,  thats sad.  Do you used facebook? agent_1:Yes, but I'm not addicted... It was a tough SC case.  I'm not sure I agree that schools should have to perform medical procedure.  They are school not a hospital.  agent_2:Yes I agree,  unless they have medical training.  agent_1:It was all kinds of things with her... Infections, injections, etc... The school would need a team.  She got a standing ovation when she graduated.  agent_2:Right.  That is pretty amazing.  agent_1:Facebook... It seems to have many uses.  Iceland is using to rewrite their constitution.  What do you use it for? agent_2:I use it for keeping in touch with people,  seeing what people are up to and news.  How about yourself? agent_1:That's the same with me.  I comment very little.  I didn't realize Facebook is blue because Zuckerburg is red-green colorblind...	agent_2:Me either.

I hear they don't have any snakes there. agent_2:Nice!  I didn't know that.  Only 70 percent of the worlds snakes lay eggs. agent_1:Seriously?  Then I guess the rest do live births? agent_2:Yes.  Boas and some others give live birth. agent_1:Well that's creepy.  It's as creepy as knowing there are some snakes that can fly. agent_2:Yikes!  I don't want to see those.  Not even in a zoo.  lol  When snakes are born with 2 heads, they fight each other food.  That's creepy too.  Is that a common thing with snakes????? agent_1:i don't know. That does seem really weird to picture a snake fighting itself. agent_2:I know right?  I'm going to have to google it.  A man has been bitten so many times by snakes that his blood is able to be used as antivenom.  I wouldn't want to be him. agent_1:Me either.  They say that our brains are naturally hard wired to be afraid of snakes. agent_2:I believe it.  I jump and shout when I see one. lol  Australia is the only continent where ven9omous snakes outnumber the non-venomous ones. agent_1:I totally believe that. i've seen things about that country on tv.  They seem to have a lot of scary creatures over there. agent_2:Those salt water crocs. I wouldn't want to cross paths with either from there. lol  Some owls keep blind snakes in their nests as helpful associates, reducing the abundance of nest parasites.  How interesting is that?  ...and how do they know they are blind? lol agent_1:Wow, that is actually a good question! I don't know. I do know that oddly enough, crocodiles are more closely related to birds than snakes and lizards.	agent_2:That's interesting!

After filming the goonies steven spielberg flew the entire cast to hawaii and surprised director richard donner with a cookout. agent_2:Amazing!  Thats so nice. When steven spielberg rode jurassic park the ride on opening day he requested that he was let off before the 84 foot drop agent_1:Too funny! Speaking of entertainers that make a lot of money, With over $8.5 billion worldwide film earnings, tom hanks is the highest all-time box office star. agent_2:He is very talented.

And then they run around the bases, if they are lucky enough to hit said ball. agent_1:Yeah that is true. It's crazy that baseball managers can actually join in the game, that's why they wear uniforms agent_2:Yes, if they need to play for their teams, I dont know why that would happen, but it might be fun to watch! agent_1:Yeah that could be cool. It's also cool that a man found millions of dollars worth of old baseball cards in his attic haha his grandfather and put them there and I guess forgotten about them? agent_2:Maybe, I should start checking my attic and see what treasures are stored up there.  I might have an early retirement.   agent_1:Haha yes I hope so! You know what is weird though? Have you ever played the game kickball, apparently it's called soccer-baseball in Canada for some reason agent_2:I guess it is a pretty accurate name too, however I much prefer kickball. agent_1:Uranium kickball sounds a lot better haha.

9103	agent_1:hey did you know a robot can now be programmed to debone a chicken? agent_2:Interesting. There is even a robotic arm that a paralyzed woman controls with her thoughts. agent_1:wow that is cool, do you Like Michael Jackson? He wanted to build a 50 foot robot haha agent_2:That sounds pretty wild. I think the mars robots are cute. The Curiosity sings happy birthday to itself on its birthday. agent_1:haha they are cute! did you ever watch Mythbusters? I guess they created a robot sidekick on that show agent_2:I do watch that sometimes but have not seen that episode. I guess the idea of chess playing robots have been around for awhile. Napoleon and Benjamin Franklin lost chess games to a robot, but it wasn't really a robot. A person was hidden inside.  agent_1:haha I remember hearing about that, one thing I'm glad is the US military uses xbox 360 controllers for the eod robots, thats probably cost savings agent_2:Do you worry about robots getting minds of their own? Megatron, a fictional character, was the leader of a civil rights group on Cybertron that wanted equal rights for all robots. agent_1:haha yes I would worry about that, especially now they are putting rat brains into robots, that is scary! agent_2:Really? That is strangely awesome. Have you heard of the home robot Amazon is building? I need one. agent_1:no I haven't, do you know anything about it it sounds awesome! all I know is amazon actually owns imdb, you know that movie site agent_2:Oh, interesting! They are into all types of niches. This project has been many years in the making and it's called the Vesta. We might be able to get it next year, but the robot will likely become a roving Alexa. Unfortunately, it probably won't be a housekeeper. agent_1:ah thats too bad because thats what I need! Would you work at an Amazon warehouse? I guess a worker can walk up the 15 miles a day from their shift work agent_2:I would love to work at an Amazon warehouse. I think it might get me into shape! In the future that job will probably be done by robots but for now, it's even hard to train a robot to pick up a coffee mug, a task that is incredibly easy for humans. agent_1:haha thats what I think too, and I do wish I were the first person to order on amazon, only $28 and you could have had a building named after you! agent_2:Nice! I think we will see Amazon come out with a factory floor robot sooner than one that has to adapt to a landscape that changes constantly because of dirty laundry and kids clothes. agent_1:haha that would be awesome! humans are always evolving though, maybe robots are the next thing, I mean only 200,000 years ago we still had body hair agent_2:And a lot of people do still have an awful lot of body hair. Haha. We supposedly get goosebumps because of an evolutionary trait that was used to make fur stand up and make an animal look bigger	agent_1:haha that is funny, it's weird that humans lost the ability to synthesize vitamin c, our gene is defective	agent_2 likes health. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['health', 'technology', 'robotic arms'].

I can't believe that someone had a seizure at Ken Jeong's comedy show! agent_2:I have never had one but i have seen people have them and yeah he thought it was a heckler thats pretty insane agent_1:I know! Crazy! I would have probably though the same. They said he ran right over to the person!  agent_2:Yeah he was an internal medicine practitioner before he turned to comedy so he attended to the woman until medics arrived agent_1:That is great. I heard that the audience members didn't even record this. Amazing! agent_2:That is suprising considering how glued people are to their phones agent_1:I agree. I just hope most people are happy with how he reacted. That can be crazy! agent_2:I agree the audience met him with a round of applause when he returned to the stage. agent_1:So, Did you even realize that Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 shows since 1989?? agent_2:no I did not realize that why are they cancelling so many shows?  agent_1:Personally it feels like it because so many people are so sensitive now.  agent_2:I agree with that I think people are way too sensitive now.. I liked all the shows that used to be on like 3rd Rock form the Sun it won the golden globe for best comedy series in 1997 agent_1:I loved 3rd rock!  Are you into comics at all?

I think we only have artistic renderings of the dodo agent_2:Yeah I remember seeing video when I was younger I will never forget it.  Did you know hummingbirds will actually steal spiderweb to help construct their nests? agent_1:I had heard of that, sounds like the spiders need SPIDER POLICE to make sure that no webs are stolen haha agent_2:Yeah I would like to see a fight settled between the two, that would be hilarious! agent_1:what I didn't know was that birds bones are so hollow that the bones themselves as a whole weigh less than the feathers!	agent_2:Wow that is incredible!

Yeah, I like public transportation when traveling its fun.  agent_2:yes, it is a good way to learn about a country. public transportation is a cheap and convenient way to travel in a foreign land. i recommend it. agent_1:The first king to travel around the world was the king of hawaii. agent_2:he must have had a hankering to see the world and understand other peoples and cultures. i admire his sense of adventure and curiosity. agent_1:Yeah I wonder when he did that,  I cant remember a time where Hawaii had a king lol agent_2:I think it was King Kamehameha. he was the last king, i believe. agent_1:I see.  I hear Iceland has no public rail service,  most natives fly across the country. agent_2:that makes sense. iceland is very small and perhaps the terrain is not good for rail. planes could be very convenient. agent_1:I hope its not expensive to fly if people have to constantly do it. 	agent_2:yes, they might have high speed buses too. that would be a hoot.

4836	"agent_1:Do you like fish? agent_2:Yes, I love fish (at least eating it). I find it funny that freshwater fish only ""drink"" water through their skin via osmosis, while saltwater fish also drink water through their mouths. agent_1:I like to eat them too, and that is funny, have you heard of the black swallower fish before? agent_2:Well, I've heard that they can eat prey twice their length and ten times their weight, so they must be quite strong.  agent_1:I agree and also a scary species, they seem like quite the predator agent_2:Yeah, for sure! I also found it interesting that a seahorse is the only fish to have a neck. I didn't even know it was a kind of fish. agent_1:The only one? reallly? that is suprising I though most fish had a neck agent_2:Actually, I think what we take for a fish's neck (I've made this mistake also) is not really a neck, but more the area where their gills come out. I find it interesting also that 84 per cent of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish. agent_1:Sounds like a fish we have to study a lot more closely, they can be the solution to many of our health problems and the immortal jellyfish agent_2:Yeah, for sure! It's kind of funny actually, because they said that in humans, that if a human has a rib surgically shortened, that he/she can regrow a rib equally as strong as the original within only 2-3 months. agent_1:Humans are just amazing, we adapt for persistnace and we are the best distance runners in all the animal kingdom agent_2:Yeah, for sure! Humans do have their downfalls though, because they cannot synthesize their own vitamin c like animals and plants can. agent_1:I guess its a great thing we know how to appy science,  agent_2:Yeah, for sure! One thing that humans have going for them however is their creativity. Did you know that there is an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel? That's really funny.  agent_1:I didnt know that, do you like to read? it does sound like a funny contest agent_2:Yes, I love reading. It's kind of funny, because architecture, literature, music, painting and sculptures were olympic events from 1912 until 1952. I don't know why those would be considered sports, but that is quite interesting. agent_1:It is interesting, never considered as sports either, do you know who Winston Churchill was? agent_2:Yes, he was the British Prime Minister during WWII and in 1953 he won a nobel prize, ironically though, it was in literature and not peace. agent_1:I didnt know him as much of a writter but I haver to read some of his novels and works"	agent_2:Yeah, he sounds like an interesting guy. It's kind of curious though, because it has been said that romantic kissing is a fairly recent development and is rarely mentioned even in ancient greek literature. How can they explain Romeo and Juliet then?

Astronauts are so cool, they vote from space agent_1:Every vote counts lol  agent_2:It sure does. In the UK not all men were able to vote until 1918 agent_1:Thats weird.  I wonder why that was.  Did you know the us sante used the same gavel for 165 years! agent_2:Yeah until Nixon broke it. I wonder if they were mad at him for that	agent_1:haha,  maybe he just had to pay for a new gavel. 	agent_2 dislikes work. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['work', 'history', 'gavel'].

Did you know that baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically eligible to play if they need to? agent_2:I wouldn't have guessed that. I always thought of the managers as those out of shape guys who yelled at the players.  agent_1:Me too. Did you know that baseball is hugely popular in Japan?	agent_2:That I did know. They have some great teams over there. I think they were surprised at how popular it is in america as well. 	agent_1 likes travel. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['travel', 'sports', 'no'].
9291	agent_1:Good morning. Do you follow politics? agent_2:Good morning, I'd say I follow some politics, but not too deeply. agent_1:Were you aware that the taller candidate usually wins in the election. since 1900 it has happened 75 percent of the time. agent_2:Is that so, maybe I should enter politics, I'm over six feet, I could have missed my calling. agent_1:Maybe so. Lol. Did you know that nevada is the only state to have a none of these candidates option while voting?  agent_2:I guess it's nice to have that option, especially if you have one one your really don't want to vote for, for example, someone who doesn't exactly agree with history textbooks. agent_1:On a funnier note. President truman in 1957 refused to have his picture taken with dumbo because he didnt want to be associated with republicans. Lol. agent_2:Media savvy in the days before camera phone and the internet, I would categorize him as forward thinking. agent_1:H sure was. Did you know that the use of red and blue for the two major parties was not used until the year 2000. Crazy huh? agent_2:That is the kind of thing you think has been around for ever.  Maybe that is why we only have two major parties, everyone's two favorites colors are taken. agent_1:I think they should just change all of their colors to brown. During the 2012 elections international electoral observrs were blocked from the polls in nine states. agent_2:That would make me suspicious of what is going on there, why don't they want to be observed?  These are the places that end up with animals becoming mayor, or cats placing high on Senate elections. agent_1:I would say a cat would be better than some of the politicians. So have you ever played fantasy congress? agent_2:Fantasy congress sound like it is taking the whole fantasy sports thing to far.  I can't see many people sitting in bars yelling at CSPAN because their politician has made the wrong move. agent_1:No janet you were supposed to be against abortion. Lol. I v could see it as well. Sorry about that last message. I dont know what happened there. Did you know that the first woman was elected to congress in 1916. agent_2:Woman are becoming more represented, may one day the Presidential job can be their, whether she is red or blue. agent_1:I just dont understand why women couldnt vote but could be elected to congress. agent_2:Maybe it was an oversight of the rule writers, a loop hole so to speak.  Surprising that so many men would have voted for woman back in 1916. agent_1:I am surprised as well. Did you know that elmo once testified before congress? agent_2:Elmo, I'd like to have seen how they did that.   What would he have been talking about.  I know Steven Colbert did so too, in character. agent_1:Im not a big stephen colbert fan to be honest with you. Do you know that voter turnout or president hasnt crossed 62.8 percent in over 100 years agent_2:In all likelihood it will continue to drop and more people get frustrated with Congress.	agent_1:You are probably right on that.

That rule works for me... agent_1:That is very interesting, I wonder if any other countries around the world have similar rules.  agent_2:Probably... I didn't know Tom Hanks had a brother that does his voice on video games and merchandise... agent_1:Jimmy Hanks!  I think I have heard about that before, good call! agent_2:I guess ya gotta help out your bro.  Video games were once called ""cathode ray tube amusement devices"" by the military... Yawn... agent_1:Yeah I don't think they imagined there would be multimillion dollar stadiums built for them.  agent_2:What was the military even doing with them?  Did you know that Venus doesn't tilt so it has no seasons? agent_1:That is interesting, I think it is the only planet that rotates clock-wise as well.  agent_2:For really weird rotation, Uranus actually rotates sideways and seems to ""roll"" around the sun.  agent_1:Thats crazy, I wonder what earth would be like if we weren't spinning around, and we were rolling like uranus lol.  agent_2:I guess we'd have really burned and cold poles.  Jupiter has a moon. Ganymede, that's more than big enough to be a planet if it were rotating the Sun. agent_1:Very interesting.  I guess there is a planet out there that has crazy winds of glass that blow at 4500 mph! agent_2:Wow, that would require a bit more than an umbrella... I guess signs of life have been detected on a planetary system 455 light-years away.  Very far, far away... agent_1:That doesn't seem too far away in the whole of space, very interesting, I wonder what our technology will reveal in the next 10 years or so.  agent_2:It's small condiering the universe and very far for Earthlings.  We can't even fathom going to Proxima Centarti 4+ light-years away.  So are you into celebrities? agent_1:Oh yeah for sure far for us as humans, I would really say I am, I don't get all the hype.  How about you?"	agent_2:Most of them have pissed me off with their force-fed moronic political views.  I do miss Robin Williams.

At least it's american made. The candy is made in pennsylvania. agent_2:What candy is made in Pennsylvania besides Hershey? agent_1:They've got milky way bars, mars bars, and even jelly beans! agent_2:Wow, that's way cooler than the fact that they didn't let women wear pants until 1993. agent_1:I know. It is so surprising to me that it took that long for two women senators to protest by wearing pants on the senate floor. agent_2:They wore pantsuits, they kept it classy. haha. agent_1:Yes they did.  Senate is very big on tradition.  They used the same gavel for 165 years until it got cracked. agent_2:Senate can be so cool, haha. Did you hear that in 1988 they arrested senators to force them to vote? I thought that sort of things only happened on House of Cards agent_1:I have heard about that.  One of the senators tried to escape and was carried feet first into the senate chamber by three officers! agent_2:Yeah, I think that rule might be from before senators were elected. They weren't elected until 1913. agent_1:Elections are a good and a bad thing.  I've heard somewhere that the people of Ancient Athens came to the conclusion that elections would lead to an oligarchy. agent_2:I think that might be because nobody votes. Voter turn out hasn't gone higher than 62% in 100 years. agent_1:Maybe some people figure there's no need to vote.  Research shows that the taller candidate wins most of the time anyway.	agent_2:We should just have people voted in by lottery.

She is super-extra! agent_2:No I didnt catch that episode, so do you like Pop music? agent_1:I do like pop music. Did you know Ariana Grande got hit by a puck twice in one game? agent_2:I didn't know that, that is odd lol, twice in a game? she must have a puck magnet in her forehead. agent_1:Yeah, it just was on twitter or Apple news this past weekend. There's a picture of her sitting on a zamboni too! agent_2:I guess there's a lot of controversy because of that, do you like snakes? agent_1:No. I hate snakes. I mean irrational hate!

We gotta start looking for some tall people to run in 2020 agent_2:lol, Using the lottery to appoint leaders is scary like they did in ancient Athens!  agent_1:Very true.  I wouldnt just want any random politician in charge. agent_2:True, They thought it would lead to oligarchy. agent_1:It could have.  I think we need what Nevada has, a none of these candidates option on the ballot. agent_2:I was thinking the same thing! Why are they the only state? All states should have that. agent_1:It would really let the government know what the people are thinking. agent_2:I agree, I'm surprised its only republican presidents that have had beards! agent_1:Yeah, there havent been that many at that either. agent_2:Two, lol Its funny they have a candy desk at the senate filled with chocolate bars and jellybeans!	agent_1:Id be claiming that as my desk!

When Google is down, almost all web traffic is down also. agent_1:Yes!  I can't believe they have been around over 20 years already since be founded in 1998. agent_2:An innovative company, they are.  They once used live goats instead of people to mow their lawns! agent_1:That is kind of neat.  I'm surprised I haven't seen that happen before.  When there is a disputed border, google maps will tailor their maps to the claims of each country where the interenet browser is located.  Weird and kind of odd fact. agent_2:Technology is progressing so rapidly.  I think it is an interesting that what we refer to as AI constantly changes.  What was considered AI before is normal now. agent_1:AI has really come on strong in the last 2 years.  AI crushed all human records in the puzzle game ""2048"". agent_2:I think it is an important idea to focus on the human aspect as we become more technologically advanced.  That's the focus people in Silicon Valley are taking. agent_1:I agree.  Facebook is developing an AI desinged to understand user emotions, identify objects in photos, and predict users actions. agent_2:I admire John Doerr for writing a book about how to make people work together more productively. agent_1:I'm going to have to look that book up.  I'm not familiar with him or the book.  Speaking of books, I didn't know Kristen Stewart co-authored a paper about AI. agent_2:Yeah, you should read the book.  Learning how to make teams work together more productively is useful because companies perform better when their teams are more motivated I guess. agent_1:I'm going to look it up when we're done here.  Are you a big Amazon user?  I am. agent_2:Yes, I use Amazon all the time.  I suppose it's hard not to use Amazon either.  They are the largest internet retailer in the world. agent_1:I agree.

I want to go to Iceland but it sounds like the public transport isn't great-will probably rent a car. agent_2:No crepes, I did have snails which I like. I've had a layover in Iceland, it looks like the moon. Flying it a lot of volcanic lava flows turned to rock. Did you know about that gnome stealing thing, take a picture, then return? That a lot of work. agent_1:Haha yeah I heard about that. Does sound like a lot of work. Did you fly any domestic flights in Iceland? That seems like a good way to get around there. agent_2:No, Iceland Air is cheapest to Sweden, I work there a couple times a year. I'm on the east coast so it's a quick flight though. Do you like fiction, a reader? That how I bide my time. agent_1:Awesome lucky. Yeah fiction is entertaining. I like it because it is not based strictly on history or fact. agent_2:Yes, I'm not much on Science Fiction, more literary fiction. I didn't know Isaac Asimov coined ""robotics"" I have friends who  love him and Sci Fi. What genre do you like? agent_1:Oh nice good genre. I like fiction as well. Edgar Allen Poe's first developed cyborg's in fiction which is pretty cool.  agent_2:Yes and Poe developed the detective genre I read too. I read War and Peace, but the Smash Bros is 4 million words even longer? That would take some time. agent_1:Wow. Is War and Peace good? I know Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction but I have never read his text. agent_2:Yes, I liked it but it's a complex novel. Yes, I read Caesar history of the Gallic Wars. Pretty interesting in light of France now. Do you like music, you see where the highest violin bow price sold for $182,000 wow, that quite expensive per pound. agent_1:You have read a lot I'm impressed. I love music and sometimes classical. Hard to believe a violin sold for that. Hopefully it wasn't the one made out of stone! agent_2:Gold and tortoiseshell i read, I feel sorry for the turtle. You like fiddle or violin more? Country or classic as the instrument is the same. agent_1:Wow. Interesting. I like the fiddle because I prefer country music. A famous scientist who played the violin was Albert Einstein. agent_2:Interesting, complex man. Did you know they have to play and ""break-in"" a violin? That makes sense though interesting it changes the cellulose molecules in the body. agent_1:Kind of like a shoe? Very interesting. It is also good for the small muscles and nerves of the arms and hands. Just ask Larry Fine from the Three stooges!"	agent_2:That funny, yes, you like me must have a few years on you.

That's awful to hear! agent_2:Of Roosevelt's 20 pets two were a bear and hyena! agent_1:Whoa, cool! I know he seemed to be quite the animal lover. agent_2:And there are more pets in Japan than there are children under 15.

And in 2002 Germany gave them legal rights. agent_2:Yeah, and the Loch Ness monster is protected under the 1912 Scottish Animal Protection Act. agent_1:I wonder if the immortal jellyfish needs protecting... being immortal and all. agent_2:Lol...speaking of water animals, did you know that hiccoughs are a left over from evolution when we had gills? agent_1:Maybe that connection is part of why 84% of human disease genes have counterparts in zebrafish, too... hmm. agent_2:Hmm?

It's crazy that baseball managers can actually join in the game, that's why they wear uniforms agent_2:Yes, if they need to play for their teams, I dont know why that would happen, but it might be fun to watch! agent_1:Yeah that could be cool. It's also cool that a man found millions of dollars worth of old baseball cards in his attic haha his grandfather and put them there and I guess forgotten about them? agent_2:Maybe, I should start checking my attic and see what treasures are stored up there.  I might have an early retirement.   agent_1:Haha yes I hope so! You know what is weird though? Have you ever played the game kickball, apparently it's called soccer-baseball in Canada for some reason agent_2:I guess it is a pretty accurate name too, however I much prefer kickball. agent_1:Uranium kickball sounds a lot better haha. What do you think about the Japanese? Apparently they are shocked to learn that baseball is actually America's pastime and was not invented in Japan agent_2:It is surprising, I bet they wonder why they are not invited to the world series either. agent_1:Haha yes I bet! I think it's interesting that the Women's World Cup higher television ratings than the World Series. I don't like soccer myself. agent_2:I would actually say I am a bigger soccer fan than Baseball.  Especially when it comes to world cups. agent_1:Yeah I don't really like either game haha. It is crazy though that the World Series actually started back in 1903, so I do respect its long history. agent_2:The cubs won the first back to back series and then didnt win again until 2016.  That is a long time. agent_1:Yeah that is a long time, and apparently the Ottoman Empire was still a thing back when they first one at haha agent_2:Wow, I guess I hadnt realized they had overlapped.

Did you know that women until recently could not wear pants on the Senate floor? agent_1:That's very upsetting. Do you know how recently? agent_2:It wasn't until 1993 and two women had to be defiant to get their point across.  agent_1:What?! That's far too recent. I didn't realize sexism quite that blatant was so recent. Very upsetting.  agent_2:Yes it is.

Julie Taymor directed the Broadway musical by the way agent_1:They made it dubbed in zulu for african release, that was nice of them agent_2:Yes I agree. I also like how revolutionary Disney was with their use of multi-plane cameras, that really adds to an animated scene and they used it in Bambi agent_1:For sure, it is amazing what they can do. Frozen was a good song, ever seen it? agent_2:Yes I did like that movie. I think it was the first Disney movie to be directed by a woman.   agent_1:For sure, that is a good stat. They need more women directing disney movies  agent_2:Yes I think so. What do you think about the movie Big Hero 6? That was actually decent, it's not my favorite but it is impressive they used a 50,000 core computer to render it agent_1:Wow, I did not know.

Have you ever tried to play the guitar? agent_1:I tried but I wanted to play well immediately and it made my finders hurt.  I'm no Jimmy Page...  agent_2:I tried to learn many years ago. I just didn't have the patience. My daughter has taught herself the ukulele. agent_1:No patience here either... The guitarist from Queen uses coins for pick. Maybe that would have helped... agent_2:Have you seen ""Bohemian Rhapsody""? I think it would be interesting. agent_1:No, but I used to be a Queen listener.  I don't know much about Linkin Park but they have the best selling album of the 21st century call ""Hybrid Theory.""  agent_2:Growing up I was a little indifferent to Queen, but now I really like a lot of their stuff. Which band do you think is beater, Queen or Led Zeppelin? agent_1:Different styles but I'd go with Led Zeppelin since they were more prolific. They named the song ""Black Dog"" after a dog that hung around the studio. agent_2:Yeah, That is interesting. I guess naming a song can be a challenge."	"agent_1:Naming software is the same way... I'm surprised that Led Zeppelin helped fund Monty Python's ""The Holy Grail""... Classic..."	agent_2 dislikes movie. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'books', 'book genre'].
2720	agent_1:Hi!  Do you watch the news? agent_2:Yes I love watching the news. How about you? agent_1:I love the information, but everything these days is so slanted from both sides sometimes it is hard to get. agent_2:Right there is not one source out there that you can trust. I hate the news outlets, but still need to see what's going on. agent_1:Much agreed.  I find that the truth lies somewhere in the middle.  The media tries to create outrage for their ratings. agent_2:Exactly. That's why I watch both CNN and Fox. It kind of helps me to sort through the muck. agent_1:Fox is watched more than Cnn and MSNBC combined.  Kinda crazy to think that. agent_2:I think Fox is slightly more honest than the other two. agent_1:Fox news threatened to sue the simpsons over their constant parody. agent_2:I didn't know that. I don't watch the Simpsons. I know CNN is whining because they can't get any conservative guests. Why would you want to go on their show and be abused.	agent_1:Why would a liberal news network want a conservative guest?	agent_2 likes news. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['news', 'TV show', 'no'].
9590	agent_1:Hi!  Are you a fan of cats? agent_2:Yea cats are awesome, in japan and taiwan they have cat cafes where you can have drinks and pet cats agent_1:That is pretty cool.  It is crazy to think that when a cat reaches 15 years old it has spent 10 years of its life sleeping. agent_2:Sound like the life to be able to be able to sleep 10 years out of 15 like cats too agent_1:They are pretty lucky that way.  There is a cat that is published, but only because a physicist listed him as the co author so he could write in first person. agent_2:Lol thats pretty cool but not as cool as Talkeetna Mayor Stubbs	agent_1:Mayor Cat?  Hmm...  hed probably put nap time as mandatory.

2401	agent_1:Hi, how are you?	agent_2:Great!

7008	agent_1:Did you hear about the 300 crocodiles killed in Indonesia? agent_2:Yeah I think that is sad. Us humans are invading these animals' space and we think we own the place. agent_1:I agree.  We dont even respect other humans, so animals definitely dont get any resepct.  We really need to treat every living thing with respect. agent_2:It's especially bad because it was a licensed sanctuary that Sugito wandered into to collect food. This was undoubtedly done without permission. agent_1:It is like when the kid fell into Harambe's cage.   agent_2:Right, I was mad about that one too. Police tried to stop the killings but there were 600 people so it was impossible. agent_1:That is horrible.  There are 20 quintillion (yeah that is a number) animals on earth and humans are one.  Id say we are slightly outnumbered. agent_2:Killing a protected species is a crime in Indonesia so it was just those people who were out of control. What's gross is the villagers took selfies with the crocodiles afterward. agent_1:I would get killing the one, but trying to exterminate a species because of one bad one is stupid. agent_2:Yeah, and I still don't think it's bad because the villager wandered into its habitat. But some people did question the logic of having crocodile ponds so close to a village. agent_1:Or rather building a village close to where the animals already live. agent_2:What about the Disney World alligator? Did you hear about that one? agent_1:I vaguely remember something about that, what was the deal with it again? agent_2:There was a sign that said stay away from the water but the parents let him get too close to the pond. He was scooping up water into a pail when he was snatched. Poor kid. agent_1:I remember that now.  I feel bad, it is just awareness. Some people have none	agent_2:Yeah, I heard that he was also playing in the water. And in this case they euthanized the alligator and humanely removed others.	agent_1 likes pets. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['pets', 'news', 'news'].
10249	agent_1:Do you enjoy music? agent_2:Yes. I love Jazz music but I also have a love for Kanye West songs. agent_1:Jazz is amazing. I love how it maintained its core essence, yet amalgamated with local musical culture to generate countless distinct styles agent_2:Yes. I listen to it every night when I eat dinner. I have really gotten into Modal jazz. Most people like Jazz-rock, but I'm more of a 1950's guy. agent_1:I think all you mentioned are great, but personally I enjoy how cool jazz has developed	agent_2:Are there any particular cool jazz groups you like?	agent_1 likes music. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'jazz', 'Modal jazz'].
5533	agent_1:Hi, how are you? agent_2:Good! Do you like baseball? agent_1:I do like it. Do you? agent_2:Yes there are interesting facts about baseball, like the number of balls used in a season: 160,000!! agent_1:Wow, that's a lot! The Nationals missed the playoffs last year too! agent_2:I looks it was a difficult season for them, they did score but against one of the teams in the bottom, the Marlins agent_1:They had a really great lineup that really underpreformed. It was a shame they couldnt perform under their new manager. agent_2:that is tough, they were basically depending on other teams to collapse, the braves and the Phillies agent_1:The Braves over performed and the phillies did too. It would be tough to win that division with those two ahead of you. agent_2:Talking about the world series, i found it funny that in 2014 a great song was banned by 2 san francisco radio stations, do you know why? agent_1:I do not know, why?	agent_2:it was the series between SF giants and new orleans Royals, so they banned Royals by Lorde, i think that is a great song	agent_1 likes sports. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'TV show', 'sports'].
2326	agent_1:Hi Do you know that disney has a new line of Mickey ears  agent_2:AWWW, really? How cute and I would love to get some for my kids. I love Minnie her actually name is Minerva. Cute. agent_1:Wall e was given that name to remember walter disney agent_2:How adorable. I never knew that. We are really into the subcultural of finding the hidden mickey mouse image in all things disney, its a fun hobby.  agent_1:yeah had seen few videos of the easter eggs of mickey in every production agent_2:Oh wow, thats cool. I never heard about that one either. I know Bill Nye was involved with disney, he is a funny scientist.  agent_1:for flubber well pretty rare to involve a scientist for a fictional movie. . good move by the team	agent_2:Yea, good point. It was a great movie and well done. I havent watched it in a really long time though. Disney changed its name in 1986. They make bold moves.	agent_1 likes movie. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'TV', 'Bill Nye'].
5004	agent_1:How's it going, do you follow baseball? The Nationals recently traded Daniel Murphy and Matt Adams to the Cubs agent_2:I don't follow baseball much, but I do think I heard something recently in the news about how the Cubs won over the Phillies? It's so confusing when they trade players for me to follow! agent_1:Yea, I guess the manager Martinez isn't doing too good in Washington and traded them away agent_2:I think the Cubs have been having a lot of trouble with their player's health. I hope they can turn it around and have a good season! agent_1:Maybe, but the Cubs haven't been too lucky since they started in 1903 agent_2:I think I've heard about that...are they the team that one back to back and then haven't won another World Series since then? agent_1:The Cubs didn't win until 2016, they beat the Royals I believe  agent_2:Oops meant won not one. I remember a long time ago they lost in a famous World Series game to the White Sox. I'm glad they won recently, as it's been a long time! agent_1:Yea, When the Cubs won 5 million people celebrated in the street, they have been waiting a long time agent_2:I bet that was one of the best baseball celebrations ever! I heard that Ronald Regan was a broadcaster for the Cubs in the thirties. He had a very interesting life! agent_1:Yea, wonder if he called the infamous Billy Goat game agent_2:How do you play that? I heard that when the Cubs first started playing baseball they were the Chicago Orphans. I wonder what the story behind that is, though? agent_1:I don't know, the Cubs were founded the same year as the Battle of Little Bighorn so maybe it has something to do with the times agent_2:That's a fun fact! I also hear they're called the North Siders because of where Wrigley Field is and The White Sox has their field on the South Side of Chicago. Have you ever been there? agent_1:No but I'd love to visit Wrigley field, it is one of the most historic baseball parks agent_2:I hear that it's a really nice place and the culture is cool there too. In example, when the visitors hit a homer into the bleachers the cubs fans throw it back into the field! lol I'd like to see that. agent_1:THat's pretty crazy. I heard Japan has a crazy baseball culture too and are shocked to find out baseball is America's pasttime agent_2:I've heard of that and wonder what the food is like at a Japanese baseball game. Do you think they'd serve both sushi and hot dogs? agent_1:Probably, I wonder if Japan has baseball cards like in the US, a guy once found 3 million dollars worth in his grandfathers attic	agent_2:That sounds like a really cool find, especially if you know the right baseball card collectors. I think I'm gonna go collect some dinner. TTYL!	agent_1 likes food. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['food', 'sports', 'team'].
7112	"agent_1:It looks like Apple is have some problems with its new HomePod product. Do you have one? agent_2:No I don't have one. But my parents do have an Amazon Alexa and my brother has a Google home which are similar devices. do you have one by the way? agent_1:Apple always overprices their stuff allowing others to offer products that are just as good at a lower price.  Kids and young adults buy them because they are ""cute"" and popular in their little clicks. agent_2:Yep I think so. It's crazy that there have been over four hundred million smart home devices shipped back in 2017 and it is projected to reach almost 1 billion devices by the year 2022 though, so they are definitely going to get more popular over time agent_1:I still feel stupid talking to an inanimate object. Siri wasn't even and Apple development.  It was originally intended for Android but Apple bought it.  agent_2:Haha that's really weird. I also think it's weird that Apple went for the high-end Market with their homepod, when you can get a Google home for about $100 a homepod goes for almost four hundred, that's definitely a rip off agent_1:Yeah, that's Apple.  They have become more competitive but, face it, like everyone else their stuff is made somewhere in Asia. SO do you use something like Siri or Cortana? agent_2:No I just stick to Google myself, I don't know what Google's voice assistant is called but it's not Siri or Cortana, what about you? What do you use agent_1:On my phone it's Google like you.  On my laptop it's Cortana by I don't use it much.   I didn't know there was a male Siri -- a British guy?   agent_2:No I didn't know that either. I only heard the female Siri haha. What do you think about the fact that a Google search uses more computing power than the power it took to send an astronaut to the Moon agent_1:People back then were good with a slide rule!  I think smart people will always be needed and computers will not take over the world. agent_2:Yes I think so. What it is crazy how far technology has come. For instance Google can use Android devices on the roads to map traffic data agent_1:Yeah.  I don't remember Google going down for 5 minutes in 2013.  It took 40% of web traffic with it.  I probably thought it was a problem on my end. agent_2:Wow that's a crazy amount of traffic! And no I don't remember that either, what do you think about the fact that Google Maps changes its Maps based on where you are searching from? That way if there is a dispute on a countries border it will create the border based on the user's location data? agent_1:That is interesting... They sure go to a lot of trouble.  Like when they used goats as lawn mowers.  They clearly didn't know how ornery goats are.  agent_2:Haha that sounds like that would have taken a long time, what do you think about the fact that the CEO of Amazon actually built a clock into a mountain? I don't know why he would do that do you"	agent_1:Yeah, Bezos will do that in lieu of compensating his employees.

His name is rocky and he is a boss! i did not know that about the blood, I wonder if they have blood drives agent_2:There are also blood drives for dogs yes, and sounds like a cute little fellow,  agent_1:What! He is awesome, getting old though but lots of good memories. Did you know dogs and elephants are the only ones that respond to pointing. My dog loves that agent_2:I didnt know that, I guess both are really smart animals, dogs can also see color so that makes them kind of unique  agent_1:For sure! Did you ever see Deadpool 2? agent_2:I did, that movie was so fun, I really liked it, did you like it? agent_1:It was actually really good. I liked lady luck!

Did you know Mercury and McCartney used the same piano to compose their songs? agent_2:Yes Bohemian Rhapsody and Hey Jude, respectively agent_1:Yeah. Have you heard of circus gallop? agent_2:Yes that is the stress testing tune for pianos right? agent_1:Yes that one but no human can play it, strange	agent_2:Yes I know.

I thought it funny that managers wear unis because they can play.  agent_1:Yeah, I never thought that was possible, I think the whole team has to get injured first though agent_2:Can you imagine someone like Tommy Lasorda playing.  It would be like Babe Ruth getting caught stealing in the 1926 World Series.  agent_1:Yeah I can imagine the scenario, Babe Ruth sure was  a great player, too bad his team lost that game back in 1926 agent_2:Yep.  Funny, kickball is called soccer-baseball in Canada.  agent_1:I see, so do you like to watch series? have you watched Game of Thrones before? agent_2:Yes and yes... I love GoT, it's a guilty pleasure of mine.  I was surprised to learn that Harry Lloyd was a relative of Charles Dickens.  Love Charles Dickens... agent_1:That is a suprising fact are they really related? guess theres no doubt where his talent comes from, you know the series are financed in part by Ireland agent_2:I heard that.  There are more famous connections too.  Talisa is the granddaughter of Talisa.  Wow.   agent_1:I wonder if they knew these facts when they casted the actors of the show, it seems like there's a lot of interesting facts behind the series agent_2:I'm sure they let it slip out during the casting.  GoT now has spin offs, a Nat'l Geo show called Game of Lions where lions are like GoT characters.  agent_1:Havent seen that one but sounds like an interesting show for sure, Game of Lions, I wonder how its similar to the series	agent_2:I can't imagine costuming lions like that.

In fact, one of its moons (Ganymede) would actually be considered a planet if it orbited the sun. agent_1:That is pretty cool. And Venus does not tilt hence it only has one season agent_2:Thats kind of similar to Uranus as well. It rotates sideways and basically rolls around the sun unlike the rest of the planets that spin. agent_1:And how about that planet where it precipitates shards of glass? That sounds scary	agent_2:Yikes! That is scary thankfully we don't have to worry about that here.

I'm Polish man... cut me some slack here :) agent_2:I am sorry? agent_1:I am too... :) I'm saying it's another subject I don't understand ;) one electron ? What does that mean ?

There's different styles of jazz...Gypsy jazz and Kansas City jazz. agent_2:I didn't know they had those two different styles. That's really cool. agent_1:Yes.

What is the antifa? agent_1:I am not exactly sure what Antifa is either. agent_2:Just looked it up and it is a left wing autonomous militant group agent_1:Ah I see seems natural they would oppose them. agent_2:Agreed. Mind if we switch to a lighter subject for the sake of this chat? agent_1:Sure did you know that shirts encompass many different types of attire for the upper body? agent_2:I did not.  That makes a lot sense. I use mine to hide my shame. agent_1:Haha me as well shame is well hidden in shirts. agent_2:I would have fit in well during the chinese cultural revolution. They layered! agent_1:Yes they had some quite interesting clothing.  It is very generic all over the world nowadays. agent_2:I had no idea the difference between a button down and a button up.

Have you heard of the band Muse? agent_2:Cant say that I have, what do they do? agent_1:Kind of pop rock. Matt Bellamy of Muse recorded his unborn son's heartbeat with his iPhone and used it on a song recording.  agent_2:That is pretty neat.  It is certainly a huge part of our society today, I am glad it has developed from the first versions where Jobs had to switch it out because it kept crashing. agent_1:That's so embarrassing. I hope he pulled it off. Microsoft held an iPhone funeral when they released their phones. That was presumptuous.   agent_2:Very much so, I bet apple just laughed.  Apple's electronics are far superior, in my opinion.  Their clothing line from 1986, likely not. agent_1:Wow! I don't remember that venture. That was a bad idea. Speaking of clothing, did you know that the pilgrims were colorful clothing? agent_2:I had heard that, but I guess i just remember the white and black from all the history books, or rather the illustrations and descriptions.   agent_1:They always depicted it that way but they only wore black for special occasions.  agent_2:I wonder why they always were depicted like that, I mean color is so much more fun. agent_1:That's a very good question. There is a store in Alabama that only sells clothing and items found in unclaimed baggage.  agent_2:It must be like a high end thrift shop.  I often wondered what happened to all of those clothes. agent_1:I think it would be interesting to visit. This is off topic but do you know much about the white house? agent_2:I know some odds and ends, like they still use floppy disks for storing files.  I didnt even know they made floppy disks anymore.	agent_1:I didn't either. I have not seen one of those in forever. Did you know that the white house has twin buildings in Ireland and France?

Do you know how much the first ever Amazon purchase was for? agent_2:No I don't know, do you have any idea, if yes how much was the first purchase? agent_1:Yeah it was for $27.95 and it was for the rights to name a building after themselves.  agent_2:Wow, I will always respect Amazon, because they offer thousandth of people employment rather or not they except it. agent_1:Yeah they do, do you know that the US postal service has a contract with Amazon to deliver on Sundays? agent_2:No I didn't know that, but I notice they Improve their delivery services to only a few days before receiving their packages. agent_1:Yeah they do.  On a different note, do you know much about sharks? agent_2:No, I don't, but I know there are different kind of sharks and they behave in different ways. I like seen them on TV, but not in real life. agent_1:Yeah I only know a little bit, I do know that because they have no bones on land, a sharks weight would crush its own body.  agent_2:most people think that all sharks are killer sharks, but I read that all shark aren't killer sharks. Have you seen the movies about sharks? agent_1:No, just tv shows about them.  I think the Greenland shark and 5 gilled sharks are the most interesting.  The Greenland sharks live for a crazy amount of time! agent_2:Yes you are right, I didn't know sharks didn't have ribs. I wonder how they upstand attacks from other animals from the waters? agent_1:Yeah isn't that interesting.  I guess they also evolved earlier than dinosaurs as well. 	agent_2:every show played on TV, always wonder how dolphins kill sharks?

The country is a crazy place lately.  agent_1:I agree. There hasn't been a US president who wasn't a rep or dem since 1853. agent_2:Wow, I guess that doesn't surprise me lol. Did you know the use of RED and BLUE for each party color only began in 2000? Weird agent_1:Oh wow I didn't know that. I saw that Ronald Reagan compaiged for democrats. agent_2:That's odd, he wasn't a Democrat, interesting. i didn't know that. agent_1:Very interesting I think. 15% of the tea party movement identify themselves as democrats. agent_2:Interesting! I was watching a vlog on Youtube who was talking about how many people are not Democrats or Republicans. I agree in that because I don't identify as either. agent_1:Did you know Fox News threatened to sue the Simpsons one time?	agent_2:Oh, wasn't that about trying to stop them from parodying the anti democratic agenda?	agent_1 dislikes politics. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'greeting', 'politics'].

It's animated, right? With lots of songs? agent_2:Yes it uses computer animation and it has love songs. It was super popular. There's a song that all the little kids were saying called""Let It Go and I guess it's based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale called the snow queen agent_1:HC wrote so many great stories. I read the Snow Queen a long time ago. I don't remember it.Has the movie won any awards? agent_2:I'm pretty sure that it has, I know that it made a ton of money. Apparently the villain used to sing that song I mentioned, Let It Go, but the song was so happy that they changed the character agent_1:that's good thinkg. I bet the song is up for an award somewhere. Who were the people involved in the film? agent_2:There's like a princess, a reindeer and a snowman, they're like them three most important characters. Also this is the first movie that was produced by Walt Disney and directed by a woman. agent_1:Not many films get directed by woman. That's good that she got the job. Good for Disney! They know how to spot talent. agent_2:I think so. Apparently she was the first female director of a film that earned over 1 billion dollars too. So that is another record that she set"	agent_1:Disney has won a ton of awards, and I'm sure she'll win awards as well.	agent_2 likes movie. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'movie song', 'movie'].

6001	agent_1:I love this time of year. Baseball opening day is just around the corner.  Are you a fan? agent_2:I have been to a few games, mostly New York Yankee games in the Bronx. agent_1:Well they Yankees are the most successful team of all time.  By far the most World Series wins.   agent_2:Bobby Richard on the Yankees was the only person to win a World Series MVP despite losing the series. agent_1:I can imagine that was bittersweet for him then.  Did you go to old Yankee Stadium or the new one that opened in 2009? agent_2:I have been to both stadiums. I suppose I am one of the numbers that support the Yankees having the second highest attendance. agent_1:Are you a Mets fan too?  I know they are not as popular as the Yankees but they have a big following too agent_2:I am definitely a bigger fan of the Mets. I like underdog stories. I never knew in 1974 they shared Shea Stadium with the Mets. agent_1:I think the Jets and Giants played at Shea at some point to.  Lots of work for the groundskeepers agent_2:I bet. It was around the same time in 1973 that two Yankee pitchers swapped families permanently. How unusual. agent_1:Probably the strangest baseball trade in MLB history.   agent_2:Haha that is very good. Speaking of strange the Ottoman Empire was still in existence the last time the Chicago cubs won the world series. agent_1:The Ottoman empire was in existence in 2016?  That does not seem accurate.  agent_2:I think it was the World Series won before 2016. Because according the the facts the Chicago Cubs were the first baseball team to win back to back world series and haven't won since, with exception to 2016. agent_1:I have to respect Cubs fans for sticking with the team for 100 years of losing agent_2:Baseball is all about tradition. That is probably why a married couple scheduled all 2430 major league games up until 2005. agent_1:Can you imagine the planning and cost that would go into that? agent_2:They were great at managing it. I never heard of any mistakes. Speaking of managers. Baseball managers wear uniforms because they are techincally able to play.	agent_1:Interesting.

12808	agent_1:Hi! You play video games? I think it's funny they were intially called cathode ray tube amusement devices! agent_2:I know I am so glad we switched to just calling them video games agent_1:Yes so much easier. In South Korea it's illegal for kids 16 and under to play video games past midnight. I would have broken the law a lot if I grew up there! agent_2:Me too and I wonder how they can tell. Do you know who Stephen Fry is? agent_1:Isn't he that narrator who narrated little big planet, and some other games as well? I thought his name sounded familiar, I would probably recognize his voice.  agent_2:Yes he did that and the harry potter and hitchhiker's guide to galaxy, such a talent agent_1:Very cool. Tom Hanks brother voice must sound quite similar because he voices Woody in the video games! agent_2:Cool. Do you know how many hours of video games we play as a planet in a week? agent_1:3 billion hours! That is so hard to believe but they are so much fun! agent_2:I know they are. Do you listen to soundtracks? agent_1:Yeah I loved the Bohemian Rapsody soundtrack cause Queen is awesome. The Jaws soundtrack was cool and Spielberg actually played the clarinet in the soundtrack! agent_2:THat guy is so talented.

I did love him as the voice of Woody in toy story but I just love pixar. agent_1:I love Pixar too.

3236	agent_1:Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You ! ;) agent_2:Me too.  Would you believe it if I told you that the Chicago Cubs last won a World Series when the Ottoman Empire was still in existence? agent_1:am... no, I don't think I would believe that... ;) was that in Wikipedia ? ;) lol agent_2:Maybe a saved version of wikipedia.  I won't soon forget when the Cubs really did win, back in 2016, over my Indians. agent_1:Your ? ;)  at that time You were cheering for Indians ? agent_2:Yes.  I'm not the owner of the team ;) ... they're just from my hometown. agent_1:Although I'm Polish - I got that ;) lol. How are they doing these days ? agent_2:Pretty good, on top of their division last year, but no where as good as the Red Sox.  They had an amazing start to the year, and then they won the World Series. agent_1:Holy crap, nice. Probably fat bonuses for everybody... but hey... if they made their fans happy, why the heck not... they earned it ! agent_2:They did.  It was almost too easy.  They have great pitchers, good hitters, and a new manager.  Normally, a new manager isn't a help, but he was from the team who won the World Series the year before, The Houston Astros. agent_1:Huh... do You think he knows a secret for winning World Series ? ;)  idk... I think it's just a well paid team ;) agent_2:Money and chemistry build winning teams, if you ask me.  Baseball is popular in the US, Japan, and a few other places.  Is it played much in Poland? agent_1:Not really, but we do buy baseball bats :) to go watch soccer games on a stadium :) agent_2:You buy bats?  Why?  I used to collect baseball cards, which can be quite valuable! agent_1:well... when one soccer team meets other soccer team and those two towns/teams are not friendly... You need to take whatever You can smuggle to the stadium to fight off the hooligans from the other team ;) lol - baseball bats are selling good in Poland but nobody plays the game ;) lol agent_2:ah ... that's a little scary.  I suppose without a baseball bat, my simple weapon of choice would be  ...  something else I can't think of.  Fascinating.  I do like soccer.  I'm a Croat (half really), so the World Cup was exciting this year.  Unfortunately, only the women's world cup is more popular in the US than the baseball world series. agent_1:Croatia won out hearts this Worldcup - seriously - great job guys   ! It was a pleasure to watch Your matches ! agent_2:Do you think Modric was really the best player in the tournament? agent_1:In the entire tournament? Maybe not the actual best, but he showed a lot of passion for sure ! agent_2:Fair enough.  Do you think soccer coaches are important to the winning of a team, like they are in baseball? agent_1:they sure are, but these days with so much primadonnas in the team, I think they have a tough job to do... agent_2:Yes, I get the impression that soccer players are paid very much.  Baseball has some of those, but only a few total and maybe one or two on each team.	agent_1:Yeah.... that among some other reasons doomed our Polish team in World Cup... sad really...	agent_2 dislikes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'work', 'fat bonuses'].

I guess they didn't want to falsely memorialize her. agent_2:I know, I couldnt ever imagine writing something like that about my family.  I guess I am lucky.   agent_1:I feel the same way. I would rather just keep it brief and impersonal if I had hard feelings rather than publicly attack them. agent_2:It is said that you shouldn't speak ill of the dead.  I wouldn't feel like I needed to have the last word. agent_1:On a more enjoyable and lighter topic, do you have any pets? I have a dog. agent_2:I don't.  I am not home very much.  But I do love animals.  I would think of myself as a cat person. agent_1:Unfortunately I am allergic to cats so while I enjoy them in small doses, I don't think I could ever own one. agent_2:I always think it would be cool to own an exotic pet, although Id never want a bear like Roosevelt had.   agent_1:I think he might be one of the few people who could pull off owning a bear. I would love to have one of the big cats as a pet but those are extremely dangerous as well. agent_2:There are actually more tigers living as pets in Asia than in the wild.  I never though people would seriously own them in masses. agent_1:I wonder if some of those are rescues and they are technically classified as pets. It would seem like there should be strict regulations to own one. agent_2:I agree.  I would be too scared to own something that could seriously eat me in my sleep, or any other time it pleased. agent_1:It's scary enough to think that my own dog probably is strong enough to harm me, let alone one of the top predators in the world. agent_2:Dogs do understand pointing, along with elephants.  They are the only two animals who have that instinct.  Id love a baby elephant, but they can get kinda big. agent_1:I've seen videos online where baby elephants interact with humans in a similar style to puppies. It's a definite bucket list experience for me! agent_2:Same here.  My girlfriend loves baby elephants, Ive tried to find a place we can go to have that experience.  I think it would be so cool, and a great surprise. agent_1:In looking some of those places up you want to find a place that is a rescue type facility. Unfortunately there are places that exploit the elephants and do not treat them well. agent_2:Definitely, not looking for somewhere they abuse the animals.  We're both big animal lovers.  I kind of like the philosophy in Boulder, CO where you can't own pets, but you are their guardian.	agent_1:For me my pets have always been family.

I have a Playstation 3, but no plans to upgrade.   agent_1:I have a ps3 as well. I dont see the point to buying a ps4. This one is all I need as well. agent_2:The game Destiny turned me off gaming.

I see Fifa 14 works on PS2, PS3 and PS4. agent_1:I was never into soccer games. I liked Madden though. Did you know that ps3s are being used to research black holes. agent_2:Yes, people let them run and they network together.  Sort of like the 1760 PS3's used by the department of defense to make a super computer.  Never tried Madden. agent_1:Never played madden. You will have to try it. How about grand theft auto. Have you played that one? agent_2:I do indeed love GTA.  I want to say that I played early rev levels on a PC.  It was a different game back then. FUDGE RIPPLE!

I was typing a lot for work when I got it. agent_2:Yes, it can be a big deal.  Imagine a Major League Baseball player missing games because of carpel tunnel.  LOL. agent_1:I can imagine it. It really is painful. Did you know that baseball managers wear a uniform because they are allowed to play if needed? agent_2:Haha.  Imagine if your boss could sit in for you at work.  He would be steamed if you said, ""I have a Fortnite related injury and must sit this out.""  agent_1:He would be steamed and I would be totally embarrassed. Lol. Did you ever play soccer baseball. That's what Canadians call kickball. agent_2:Kickball on the playground. What fun.  David Price is the MLB player with a 217 million dollar seven year contract.  Cant play ball games.

What did you think about that guy findin 3 million dollars worth of old baseball cards in his grandpas attic. agent_2:Finding 3 million dollars worth is like finding an unlock code for life. agent_1:It wouldn't guarantee you win the game but it would sure make it a lot easier.

All of Japan's highways are tolls so it cost roughly $300 to cross the country. agent_2:That is a lot of money.  Iceland doesnt have a public rail service, so people without cars take flights between cities. agent_1:That would stink to not have public rail service.

It is a great style some people consider it America's classical music today. agent_1:Yes sir... I love how every song and solo can sound totally different - even when played by the same musician... agent_2:Yes it is truly something. I have heard that New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s. agent_1:That I'm not sure about... don't know the exact date, but I always wondered how a music style begins... it's not like a guy is sitting on it's porch and thinks... ""I'm going to invent new music style and I'll call it JAZZ"" :) agent_2:Haha! Yeah i have always wondered things like that. But I have heard that Clint eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast who knew huh? agent_1:I can believe that... he is a classy Dude ;) I don't imagine him listening to disco or rap ;) agent_2:Yeah he just does not seem like the guy that would be into that.

It's too bad we can't replicate those scents and be reminded of our childhood all of the time. agent_2:I've never thought about it, but I suppose we don't have names for smells, just where it comes from. agent_1:That's true I refer to a damp basement smell as moldy but why not refer to the smell of onions as 'yuk'? agent_2:It's difficult to imagine having names for each smell, as we have for colors.  I'd think there were too many. agent_1:Yes, but imagine if the defining term could relate to the listener not only what the smell was precisely but perhaps even it's location. Maybe other languages allow for more descriptive labels. agent_2:I suppose if you have to survive, partially because of your nose, it makes sense to be very specific. agent_1:I would think so. I suppose it has validity to convey something with just one word that lets everyone know everything about it. I think it might be difficult if you were to use a smell word with someone who had never smelled that scent before. agent_2:The Semaq Beri speakers take it seriously, especially with the brother and sister thing.  They'd struggle in the city. agent_1:Ha! They would indeed. It is funny how different cultures have taboos that make no sense to anyone but them. Whenever I smell a certain perfume I find myself back in time to my school days and the girl I used to love. agent_2:I guess we have the ability to use our noses in the same way, we just don't have the need.  There's not the peril for us. agent_1:True. Not many wild predators around to threaten us. It might be interesting to know their names for smells and try to correlate them into our culture, would they mean the same or not. agent_2:It seems it very specific to what you do, like the difference between horticulturists and hunter-gatherers. agent_1:Yes, and culture. If I say to you that an object smells like (.......), you would in all likelihood have a very good idea of what I'm referring to based on shared experience. agent_2:Avoiding mixing odors seems very extreme, I can't imagine cooking at home if I have to use different burner for each meat. agent_1:That would indeed be a hardship. When I cook I'm always using the simplest most direct way to get fed. A lot of the time that involves a can and one pot. agent_2:I wonder what they'd make of some of the exotic cuisines like Indian, Thai or Vietnamese cooking. agent_1:They would be adding to their dictionary I think. Some smells give me the willies, like fish. I hate the smell so whenever I walk into someone's home that has been cooking it I get sick to my stomach, so maybe they are on to something when they don't mix odors.  agent_2:Speaking of fish, did you know there was an immortal jellyfish? agent_1:I heard that but wonder how they determined it? agent_2:Yeah, I guess there is no way to prove it.  A lot easier to prove a seahorse has  a neck agent_1:Yes. Maybe the jellyfish in question regenerates itself constantly so they just infer that it's immortal. agent_2:Another surprising fact is the burning of books by the FDA, I thought the US was against censorship agent_1:I did too. What was the subject matter and when did it happen? agent_2:I have no idea, I'd guess the thirties or fifties.  Some kinds of novels with problematic themes agent_1:Probably of a sexual nature.

What did you think of the article? agent_2:Not exactly one I've ever thought about for sure. agent_1:I figured we could just start by looking at the first section here. I found it really interesting about using robots to prepare Mars for human arrival. agent_2:I'd feel a lot better in a way sending robots up first to test things. But, what robots do not have are human emotions that would have to deal with such a bizarre plan. agent_1:Sorry for the delay. I was reading ahead and got distracted. I totally agree with you on that. The idea that we may only be 20 to 25 years away is crazy to me. agent_2:I just really don't see the point from what I've read here. Why travel so far to go to somewhere that has nothing to offer a human? Can't you just move to a different destination right here on Earth? Seems an awful lot to go through just to get away...no? agent_1:No it totally makes sense. I think the appeal is going somwhere we have never gone before. Still, it seems easier to make the earth more inhabitable than to move to another planet entirely. There are many areas of earth that we could spread to if we invested this level of effort. agent_2:Yep.....the Sahara desert comes to mind. As far as it making sense, I suppose, to those explorers out there who'd like that sort of thing. agent_1:Yes for sure. It is just such an interesting concept. To me it is just crazy the amount of time money and planning that goes into this kind of project. agent_2:Well, being alone and 61 years old, I'm willing to give it a shot, I would just be overly concerned about boredom! What to do with all that time on a different planet? agent_1:Right exactly. I have no idea how I would occupy myself. agent_2:That is why I'm sure the scientists would have to put those willing through plenty of tests to see how they would handle such a change. Like I said before, sending robots first is an excellent idea. But, they can't measure a person's mind dealing with it with robots. Can they? agent_1:No and I think that is the biggest issue we don't know on this type of journey. The physical toll would be intense yes, but the mental toll may be unimaginable until someone is put through it. agent_2:I would think that travelling with many other people that are alike would be of some comfort. You know, many people not knowing what their future will bring will certainly give it's way to plenty of conversation topics. But, for that long?  agent_1:Right exactly. I mean you may exhaust everything just on the journey itself, and likely there would be an almost non-existent shot at returning. agent_2:That is why I'm interested in why the scientists are even interested in pursuing this. I think that people would just feel better spending time on Earth than risking everything on something so ludicris?	agent_1:I totally agree. As I said I think at the beginning there are just so many options on Earth that we could explore before doing anything else.	agent_2 likes astronomy. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['astronomy', 'hobby', 'art'].

Maybe one of us will win soon, it hasn't happened since 1853. agent_2:Well I am just hoping Trump doesn't win a second term next year, but with how corrupt everything is now it is looking like a very likely outcome. agent_1:I do too, I don't particularly like him. Did you vote last election agent_2:I did, I voted Hillary even though I didn't really care for her either, but she was a much better choice than what we ended up with. agent_1:For sure, I voted third party. I was part of the problem, I wanted a 3rd party to win because it has been years! agent_2:Well Bernie Sanders just announced his 2020 run, so if he actually makes it onto the ballot this year I will vote for him. agent_1:Yea, he got taken out of the running in 2016 by hillary.

I play it a lot more than I follow it, but I do know that Roger Federer has the most Grand Slam titles in history! agent_2:I do, Juan Martin del Potro is one of my favorite players, do you know who he is? and Federer is a great player as well I really like him agent_1:I do not know much about Juan Martin del Potro.  I do know that he is Argentinian and a former US Open champion. agent_2:His a great player  he has played against Federer a couple of times, he was the champion back in 2009 as well agent_1:He is a good example of determination.  I know he had some struggles with wrist injuries and had to have a lot of surgeries.  To reach the pinnacle of the game after that is incredible! agent_2:Its been hard, 4 surgeries can really make you quite, but I guess it paid off and with hard work he was able to make it, Rafael Nadal also had a new injury agent_1:Nadal is a great player too.  Crazy to think that 56% of grand slam titles have gone to him, Djokovic, or Federer since 2000.	agent_2:Really talented players, legends of the game, Federer is the first person in Switzerland to be honored with a official stamp	agent_1 likes sports. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'favorite player', 'Detroit Pistons'].

I wouldn't get anything done but it would be amazing lol! Did you know dogs have 12 different blood types? agent_2:I did.  I guess I should get my dog checked for her blood type next time I see the vet.  Do you have a dog? agent_1:I will have to, yes, his name is rocky, he is my favorite pet of all time, what is your dogs name?	agent_2:her name is Yuki, it means snow in Japanese,  she is a white dog lol She is a rescue so we dont know the breed,  shes a mutt. 	agent_1 likes pets. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['pets', 'Google', 'pets'].

I'm sad he finally passed away from ALS. agent_1:He was tremendous thinker. Gosh, I wonder if he was as smart as Kim Jong-un, who has a degree in physics, supposedly.  agent_2:I would think that he is smarter. I wonder how it felt to have such a physical disability but yet such a sharp mind.	agent_1:In his younger years, he wasn't badly afflicted.

6180	agent_1:hey there what do you know about baseball agent_2:I know that it is a sport, played with a ball called a baseball. There are bases, and players, and bats. And hot dogs and popcorn. agent_1:haha hot dogs sound good! and yes the objective is to hit the ball and run around the bases to get to home plate agent_2:It is one of the few sports in which the player scores points, not a ball or puck.I wonder how much each baseball costs to make. agent_1:thats a good question, but you could buy a lot fo baseballs if you found millions of dollars worth of cards in your attic like that one guy agent_2:He must have wondered why his grandfather didn't do anything with them. I would sell some and keep some.  agent_1:ya kind of a bum move to sel all your grandpas cards, especially since theyve been there since 1940 agent_2:He might have needed the cash. Did you know that the opposing team receives three bases if a player catches a baseball in their cap? I've never heard that rule. agent_1:wow didn't know that! also didn't know baseball is super popular in Japan agent_2:Very popular, but not as good as the US version. Different experience in the stadium as well. agent_1:I've heard that, funny the Japan are surprised that baseball is actually americas pasttime haha agent_2:They have something called the Japan series. It doesn't draw the attention of the World Series. agent_1:huh I'll look into it, can you believe until 2005 a husband and wife team scheduled all the MLB games? agent_2:They must have had a computer to help them.

Many critics think it it the author's break through. agent_1:I have not heard of the book or the miniseries. I do have HBO and will look for it when it comes out. agent_2:That is good. It focuses on how the female characters negatively treat one another. It is unusual because it gives it's female characters permission to be bad. agent_1:Nice. I think I do remember that one now. It's with Amy Adams I think... I did see Gone Girl, did you see that one?	agent_2:I didn't, but I know it is by the same author, Gillian Flynn.

8090	"agent_1:hello there  agent_2:Hello yourself> What have you been getting up to tonight? agent_1:Just relaxing, hanging with my dog.  Listening to music. Yourself?  agent_2:Similar regarding the dog. I was talking to my roommate about MLS Soccer.  agent_1:I like Orlando City, personally. I have a good friend who used to play for Manchester United.  agent_2:Really? I bet that was wild.  I didn't think I'd ever need to know much about it myself. We were actually talking about Wayne Rooney a little bit ago.  agent_1:Do you have any thoughts about where Wayne Rooney will end up next year?  agent_2:No thoughts but I've heard talk. Atlanta has gone nuts for MLS the last couple of years. We won the Cup this year and now when you walk into a bar you hear guys speculating about Rooney to DC United next year.   agent_1:Orlando has embraced MLS too, I am quite surprised how popular it has become.   agent_2:I'm with you 110% on that. I haven't heard anyone talk about how embarrassing the Falcons are in weeks.  It makes sense. We haven't ever really had a winner before. I'm wondering if Rooney can still play or if this is like Beckham playing in LA when the MLS began.  agent_1:To switch gears for a moment, I'm listening to Dizzy Gillespie at the moment.  He always was a favorite of mine, a trumpet virtuoso. Did you now that jazz trumpeters often grow goatees because it provides comfort when they play their instrument?  agent_2:I didn't but I can see why that would be appealing.The facial hair I mean. I've tried to like it but Jazz just doesn't do much for me.  New Orleans jazz is sort of the exception. I like the big brass sections. I do like zydeco and that has a lot of jazz influence.   agent_1:I definitely would say I prefer music that's influenced by jazz, rather than jazz itself. Tom Waits is my favorite artist ever, and the influence of jazz is present on a lot of his work.   agent_2:I agree with you about the influence it's had on other music. It's kind of funny that you brought up jazz actually.  It's such a mish mash of musical influences from around the world but it's probably still the most original art form that the United States has ever produced.  That's sort of what we've got going on with the Atlanta FC here.   agent_1:Did you now that the term soccer came from ""association football""? I find that interesting. I always wondered why it wasn't called something else.  agent_2:I didn't know that. I've wondered though.  We've got all of these sports fans here from different places with competing team loyalties.  Except for soccer. Most of them never had a pro team that they grew up rooting for.  They all grew up knowing something about that.  I mean we're talking 250 million players worldwide. Now these guys have a team to root for with no competing loyalties. It's a more communal experience and it has taken off around here.   agent_1:Do you ever go to live games?  It's an experience I have only very recently had an opportunity to possibly enjoy, and yet I haven't.  I wonder if I would enjoy it for the entire duration of the game.  agent_2:I haven't gone yet but I'm going to this coming season.  My interest in other sports has waned so the timing is perfect. Get in on the ground floor of something special you know. It's hard to pick up though. You wouldn't think it would you. A big stretch of grass with a goal on either side's more complex than I thought. Theres way more people to talk about it with too. More than all the major American sports leagues combines in terms of fanbase. "	"agent_1:Yep, it gives you something to talk about with so many people from different countries. I think that's really cool. They really mean the ""world"" when they said the world cup, unlike the world series, which is just a national matchup.  That's interesting you say it's tough to pick up. I bet the best way to really learn about it would be to play FIFA video games."	agent_2 likes video games. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['video games', 'music', 'jazz influence'].
8114	agent_1:Hi, how are you? agent_2:I'm good!  Do you use youtube? agent_1:I do use youtube. Do you? agent_2:I do.  I love it!  It's where I first say Psy's Gangnam Style video.  Have you seen it? agent_1:I have not seen that one. I haven't seen Justin Beiber's Baby either but that is probably good since it is the most disliked video on the platform. agent_2:lol Poor Beib's.  Psy's video got so many views on youtube that they had to upgrade the view count integer to 64 bits. agent_1:You tube is the 2nd largest search engine behind google. Make sense since google owns them. agent_2:I believe that.  Google bought youtube for $1.65 billion dollars!  That's a lot of cash. agent_1:That is! Between youtube and netflix, they make up half of peak internet usage. agent_2:I believe it!  People love videos!  Do you have a playstation? agent_1:I kind of do... My son has one that I bought him. Do you have one? agent_2:My kids do.  I have no idea how to play it. lolol  Playstation 3's are being used to research black holes somehow. agent_1:Wow. The DoD used 1760 of them to build a supercomputer... agent_2:Wow.  Who would have thought that?  lol  The original grand theft auto game disc for playstation, when placed in a cd player would play the game soundtrack.  Kind of neat. agent_1:That is cool. The last game produced for ps2 was fifa 14. I had no idea. agent_2:I didn't either!  lol  Do you use computers a lot?  In 1936 the Russians made a computer that could run on water! agent_1:I do use them a lot. The space shuttles general purpose computer runs on 1 mb of ram. agent_2:Wow.  That's pretty incredible to think about.  Someone built a working 16 bit computer using nothing but the basic minecraft building blocks. agent_1:Maybe it was a transhumanist. They want to upload their mind to computers. I am not sure I would want to do that... agent_2:I would want to do it so my future generations of my descendants can look back at my life.

That is sort of odd. agent_1:that must date back to the day when one of the players was chosen to manage as well. like an onfield boss or leader. agent_2:Oh okay, that makes more sense for sure. The rules can be outdated sometimes, I think. I remember a story about a man who found old baseball cards in his grandpas attic. Being outdated is a good thing then. agent_1:yes, those old cards would be worth a lot to someone. i would sell some of them and keep the rest as an investment. agent_2:Yes, the man found out that they were worth 3 million dollars, in fact. agent_1:that is wonderful chunk of change! more that you could make just by chatting online with someone, i think LOL Would you sell the cards? agent_2:Yeah, I think I would too. As soon as I hired a police escort to the bank. Baseball is so popular in Japan, did you know that? agent_1:yes, i have been to games there. the fans are different, but just as enthusiastic. i recommend going. agent_2:Oh, neat what a fun experience. Yeah I learned that the fans in Japan just can't believe that Americans consider it a passtime.	agent_1:yes, they are not aware of how big stuff outside of Japan is. they think that 7-11 started in Japan. strange. but now many japanese players are in the MLB>	agent_2 likes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'basketball', 'baseball'].

The drinks sound yummy too. agent_2:Yeah they do, and fresh guacamole is always so good.  agent_1:I'd try chipotle infused tequila with my guac and chips! agent_2:Yeah that also sounds super good, I love tequila! agent_1:Have you had queso fundido? It's like Mexican fondue, yum! agent_2:Yeah I have tried that before and it is really good I would agree! agent_1:Unfortunately it seems the service at the restaurant is not so great. That is one of the most important things, for me. agent_2:Oh for sure, I have worked at a restaurant and it takes some skill to be good, but if not, bad service is the worst! agent_1:I'm getting hungry.

If you went on Mount Everest would you take a selfie at the top? Apparently they have 3-g service there agent_2:That would be great, taking a selfie in the top of the tallest mountain, I didnt know you could get addicted to the internet agent_1:I did know that, I'm probably addicted right now haha. And yes if you use the internet too much you can get addicted to clicking links agent_2:That is just crazy, its a good thing there a copy stored in the library of Alexandria, I cant imagine my life without the internet now agent_1:No I agree with you.

Its a great sport where individual players hit balls with clubs into a series of holes on a golf course in as few strokes as possible. agent_1:I never played because it looked expensive. How long have you played? agent_2:I have been playing for about 10 years now and another thing I wanted to mention that the golf course consists of 18 holes but if you play the game for fun its usually 9 holes. agent_1:Ok, but doesnt it cost a lot for the equipment and the greens fees and stuff? agent_2:Well that depends on the equipment you buy and also where you play. agent_1:I guess i would want the cheapest stuff. i played sports with minimal equipment growing up. agent_2:The gold course requires a lot of water to maintain about 312,000 gallons in fact per day. agent_1:That sounds like quite a bit. it is ok in some places, but maybe where water is scarce, it is not ideal. agent_2:This is just the average for American golf courses. I read somewhere that a golf course in Dubai requires 4,000,000 gallons of water per day to maintain. agent_1:That is insane. in a desert country? it seems excessive, but i guess that the rich have the money for that kind of hobby. agent_2:I agree. Do you know any famous baseball player that is also a very famous golfer? agent_1:Is this a recent player? i know that a lot of them play gofl. agent_2:No this baseball player was back in the 1920s. agent_1:The babe? Did he play golf? He could hit a ball pretty fall. agent_2:You guessed it correctly. Babe Ruth, he was a fantastic baseball player and at one point America's most famous golfer. agent_1:That is amazing. he was a big fellow though. i bet he could drive it pretty far.

It's just one shyster trying to get something over on the other guy, all the time.   agent_1:Yes but even in 2016 the CIA was meeting with senior congressional leaders over the fact that Putin had authorized an operation to destabilize our election agent_2:That's Putin for you, he's going to do that, hard to believe it took the CIA needing to tell them he was doing it.  I'm sure all of our ""frenemies""  do the same thing and we do it to them, too. agent_1:Yes but it is scary that McConnell is denying the evidence and claiming that it is just a scheme by the CIA to discredit Trump.  He does not believe all of our national security agencies. agent_2:On a different and much happier note than all that crazy political mess, do you realize the consistent use of the red and blue colors for Republicans and Democrats only started in 2000?  That's probably about the time it started to get real ugly in politics. agent_1:Yes that is crazy but it has been ugly for a while - Harry Truman visited disneyland and refused to be photographed on the dumbo ride because it might associate him with republicans! agent_2:You know the voter turnout for a US presidential election hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years.  I'm going to be watching 2020, I think Trump can break that! agent_1:Certainly he has 60 percent of the country who think he is doing a horrible job so it might increase the turnout!  Too bad we can't have third parties - there has not been one elected since 1853 agent_2:Actually, I think there are that many that WANT to vote for him and are going to turn out to vote against whatever candidate the Dems throw up there.  That third party thing has never seemed to work out too well, a shame. agent_1:Well if he grew a beard it might help his chances - every president with a beard ever has been a republican agent_2:Well, that's a Southern/ Texas thing, a beard and that is the base for the Republicans, so that makes perfect sense to me. But, I usually look at the taller candidate, they seem to win 75% of the time, so maybe the Dems should be looking for them a giant?"	agent_1:That is a good point.

Video games were initially called cathode ray tube amusement devices which were used by the military, another fun fact for ya.  agent_2:that is fun! kind of sad that humans as a whole play games for 3 billion hours a week agent_1:This is true! and I'm sure as video games progress and evolve we will lose touch of reality, what is reality anyway? Another cool game out there ""Little Big Planet"" was narrated by Stephen Fry. He also narrated hitchhiker guide to the galaxy and harry potter video games.

Did you know that Venus doesn't tilt so it has no seasons? agent_1:That is interesting, I think it is the only planet that rotates clock-wise as well.  agent_2:For really weird rotation, Uranus actually rotates sideways and seems to ""roll"" around the sun.  agent_1:Thats crazy, I wonder what earth would be like if we weren't spinning around, and we were rolling like uranus lol.  agent_2:I guess we'd have really burned and cold poles.  Jupiter has a moon. Ganymede, that's more than big enough to be a planet if it were rotating the Sun. agent_1:Very interesting.  I guess there is a planet out there that has crazy winds of glass that blow at 4500 mph! agent_2:Wow, that would require a bit more than an umbrella... I guess signs of life have been detected on a planetary system 455 light-years away.  Very far, far away... agent_1:That doesn't seem too far away in the whole of space, very interesting, I wonder what our technology will reveal in the next 10 years or so.  agent_2:It's small condiering the universe and very far for Earthlings.  We can't even fathom going to Proxima Centarti 4+ light-years away.  So are you into celebrities?"	agent_1:Oh yeah for sure far for us as humans, I would really say I am, I don't get all the hype.

2838	agent_1:Are you a fan of books?  I personally read a lot, mostly non-fiction though. agent_2:I don't really have time to read but when I do I like to read fiction. I find it funny that Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Greek mythology. agent_1:That is sort of odd.  There is even a wiki that ranks fictional characters by their powers, that would be an interesting read. agent_2:And in Greek literature there wasn't much kissing. Romantic kissing is actually a recent development. agent_1:That surprises me, I  guess I always associated it with all love stories.  Even Shakespeare. agent_2:Yeah I think there was a lot of romance just kissing wasn't part of it. agent_1:I see.  Winston Churchill won a Nobel Prize, for literature.  I always though it was for peace agent_2:Interesting! Literature was an olympic event from 1912 to 1952. I always associate the olympics with sports! agent_1:Same here, I always thought it was part of the ancient games but never made its way to the modern games.  How do you even judge that? agent_2:Yeah, pretty subjective. Speaking of literature contests, there isone that challenges writers to come up with the worst opening sentence for a novel. agent_1:I heard there was, I wonder what the winners were, those would be fun to read. agent_2:Do you think that literature should be censored? agent_1:Absolutely not!  That is why I hated to hear that the FDA burned 6 tons of literature agent_2:But should fan fiction be allowed? George RR Martin says it is copyright infringement and isn't useful for aspiring writers. agent_1:i think so.  I think it is a great creative outlet for pepole. agent_2:Have you heard of Tommy Orange's debut novel, There There? agent_1:i havenr, whats is it like? agent_2:It is about Native Americans in modern history but seems to also touch on how they were treated in the past. It's a fictional story with elements of truth.	agent_1:I think that might be an interesting read.	agent_2 likes books. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['books', 'sports', 'no'].

I guess the black panther is the richest superhero there is as well.  agent_2:Yea, apparently Black Panther is worth more than Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne combined agent_1:That is crazy! I never knew there was one that had more money than those guys.  agent_2:Yea, in the comics Black Panther is worth 500 billion dollars agent_1:Did you know that some of the symbols and written scripts used in the movie were based on actual script dating back to the 4th century? agent_2:Yea, based on Nsibdi from the Nigeria region agent_1:I think that is very cool, I always like it when those types of movies use actual history references.  agent_2:Yea but it's unfortunate that they censored the phrase ""praise hanuman"" from the indian release of Black Panther agent_1:That sounds really stupid to me, that overly pc stuff has gotten a bit too much for me.  agent_2:The Indians weren't happy they censored it either and thought it was empowering rather than insulting agent_1:Yeah and I don't blame them for feeling that way to be honest.  agent_2:Yea people can be sensitive over trivial stuff instead of important things, like 80% of natural forests being destroyed"	agent_1:Exactly, that is so alarming and people are more concerned with silly stuff.

A sacrifice to make? agent_1:I dont know, thats an interesting question maybe sacrifice a goat and call it a day? do you like the Yankees? agent_2:I am not a yankees fan. could we sacrifice another goat against the yankees? agent_1:Sounds like a solid plan, you get the goat lol agent_2:I figure that there must be something that can both lift the cubs curse and transport it to the yankees. Who has the most world series thus far? agent_1:I have no idea, I would have to say the Yankees,  agent_2:Yes, i think the Yankees have the most. Is this the result of voodoo and witchcraft? if so, then it can be undone through voodoo.  agent_1:I have no idea about magic, maybe Bobby Richardson is also cursed, he is the only person to win the MVP award and the lose the series agent_2:that is a shame. The new york yankees suspended don mattingly because he refused to get a haircut. Does that seem fair? agent_1:No, it does not seem fair at all, there is also a Lost  Yankees player	agent_2:Lost?

I wonder if it has anything to do with the region of space that may be pulling galaxies outside the observable universe agent_2:Wow the universe is so marvelous and complex, there are many theories, for example that there is only one electron in the universe! agent_1:That would be insane if there is only one electron in the universe, it would mean I wasted a lot of time in chemistry class agent_2:That is a crazy theory! I totally agree. It is good there has been curious people like the Greeks, Copernicus, Newton.  Not always right but opened the way for research! agent_1:Yea, it's interesting that the Universe may have evolved through natural selection like the species on earth agent_2:All this has to do with Physics... did you know Pixar studied the physics of curly har for 3 years? agent_1:No, that's pretty crazy, I wonder if they asked Kim Jong-un to help since he has a degree in physics agent_2:hahahaha It was for Maida's hair in ""Brave"" very different hair from Kim's... but maybe he helped with some knowledge  agent_1:Maybe Kim could explain how the universe was able to come from nothing without violating the rules of physics  agent_2:hahaha that would not be easy!

And hot dogs and popcorn. agent_1:haha hot dogs sound good! and yes the objective is to hit the ball and run around the bases to get to home plate	agent_2:It is one of the few sports in which the player scores points, not a ball or puck.I wonder how much each baseball costs to make.	agent_1 likes sports. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'hot dogs', 'baseball'].

A cats life must be nice. They spend over half their life sleeping! agent_2:That us true. Ha! I would like to visit one of those cat cafes over in Japan that lets you pay by the hour to drink and play with cats! I bet that's so interesting! agent_1:That would be fun! Also there is a town in Alaska that has a cat mayor! agent_2:Is that so? That's a little odd! Ha! Did you ever hear about the physicist that published his cat as coauthor so he could avoid criticism by writing in first person plural? agent_1:Haha I never knew about that.

Well, maybe I used to. agent_1:There is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans! That seems weird... agent_2:I think it's 13 hertz, very low, below our threshold of hearing. Causes fear because I think it's like an earthquake sound. agent_1:Reallly??? That's impressive knowledge! Do you know anything about ribs agent_2:I've read that they grow back stronger after they get broken, but I haven't tested that out myself. agent_1:Yeah.

Furthermore, they have highly mobile jaws and usually fangs for venom. agent_1:That's true. My husband pulled one out of my garden. I had never seen it before. It's a rat snake. I guess they are good for killing pests. agent_2:I think rat snakes aren't poisonous? Did you know that the fear of snakes are wired into human brains? I guess people who hate snakes should live in new Zealand since there aren't any there. agent_1:Nope, rat snakes aren't poisonous. They are actually a good kind. I have always believed no snakes should exist, so I believe we are wired for it! agent_2:I wonder what differentiates snakes from legless lizards? agent_1:That is a good question. Maybe that lizards have eyelids and some snakes dont.  agent_2:That makes sense. Personally, I don't mind snakes, although I am wary since venom can be quite potent and dangerous. As long as they aren't flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey are around my area and I can spot them well a head of time, I'm okay. agent_1:flying snakes? My worst nightmare!! agent_2:I guess New Zealand would be ideal for you, with no snakes and all agent_1:True! Do you ever Listen to Taylor Swift? agent_2:I have heard bits hear and there and recently read some articles, but I am not completely familiar. agent_1:She writes a lot of her music about herself. Very popular singer. Who do you listen to? agent_2:Well I do know Kanye did a self mocking skit 2 years before the infamous Taylor swift incident. Other than that, she is among the worlds contemporary artists. agent_1:And she owns a private jet! agent_2:I recently learn she once accidentally released several seconds of white noise and it somehow topped the Canadian itunes chart. agent_1:That is funny! But she also thinks music should not be free. I disagree there. I should be able to listen to it all I want. agent_2:Well for artists, royalties are a lot part of their revenue, even for moderate artists. agent_1:Thats true I suppose. Do you know Swift walks backwards so she wont have her pic taken? agent_2:Wouldn't walking backwards make her stick out more? agent_1:I would think.

Baseball is a pretty popular sport in Japan.   agent_1:Yeah i hear they think it should be their pastime. I wonder if a manager has ever jumped into a game.  agent_2:They can if need be.  There are some major baseballs fans out there! agent_1:Yeah unfortunately I do not have the patience for it. Kickball is called soccer baseball in Canada.  agent_2:That's a funny term in my opinion!  There was one person who found 3 million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic.  He  hit a gold mine! agent_1:Right, why can't stuff like that happen to me, lol. Up until 2005 a married couple was responsible for scheduling all 2430 major league games.  agent_2:Dang that sounds like a busy life scheduling all that!  One thing I like from baseball is they get to wear hats.  Do you like hats? agent_1:Love hats, all kinds my friend. How about you?  agent_2:Yep I do also!  Fun little fact about in the Old West, the Cowboy hat was not the most popular.  The Bowler hat was, whichever that looks like! agent_1:Yeah police wear distinct hats usually peaked caps or brimmed hats, like the mounties.  agent_2:Yep their hats are noticeable!  Another fun fact I learned is a chefs funny hat they wear are called Toque! agent_1:Yeah that is a fun fact i did not know that. Some hats were worn for ceremonial purposes such as the mortarboard. agent_2:Ahh yes!  All this knowledge of hats!  Lol!  British politicians were mandated to wear a top hat if making a point of order in the house of commons until 1998! agent_1:Wow that good information. Do you know where tipping your hat originated from?   agent_2:Yep it just so happens to come from knights raising their face visors to show friendliness! agent_1:I think that's really cool! In 1908 a law was passed limiting the length of the hatpins out of fear that suffragettes would use them as weapons.  agent_2:Wow sounded dangerous!

Lee is the first female director agent_1:Yes that is correct. I'm glad to see that they did that but sad that it took them so long. I see a lot of Disney toys. Did you also know that the toy industry gets involved in Disney films before the beginning of the film's production? agent_2:I don't know about it please explain the details agent_1:They prepare to make toys before the movie has even began filming. I was wondering how toys came out so quickly to promote a movie.  agent_2:I also think about it.	agent_1:Also, apparently in the 70's Disney recycled a lot of animation frames so there are identical scenes in some movies.

Or the fact that one of Google's search requires more power than it did to send Neil Armstrong and 11 other astronauts to the moon. agent_1:ya that is crazy! I do like that they're a green company and one time used goats to mow their lawn haha agent_2:Yes, goats are very effective.  Talking about google. Google uses andriod devices moments to calculate traffic  agent_1:ya they do, they also are a huge part of internet traffic, when they were down for about 5 mins they took out 40 percent of total web traffic1 agent_2:interesting..google tailors its maps around disputed borders based on where the browser is located  agent_1:haha that makes sense, do you use Spotify? I only use youtube myself agent_2:I use them all, Pandora, You Tube and Spotify. The all have there different  purposes. Spotify has so many songs that 20% of them have never been played. agent_1:ya that is crazy, that's about 4 million songs, I guess a musician woul dneed their song played 130,000 times in order to earn minimum wage  agent_2:Yes per day, that is crazy.

Did you know seahorses are the only fish with a neck? agent_1:I don't think a black swallower fish would be good as a companion pet either because it can eat prey twice its length! agent_2:That would freak me out! But I bet it catches that prey using its acoustic communication! agent_1:Could be. Fish are cool like that.

The Thin Silence? i havent heard of it. agent_1:Yes apparently it's being developed by Two PM Studios, it sounds really crazy it uses the look of videogames from the 80's agent_2:What? the 80s? like NES and stuff?  Why? seems odd. agent_1:Yes I think so! Do you play any video games by the way? agent_2:i used to play a long long time ago. havent played recently. the systems look cool, but i dont have the time LOL agent_1:Yeah I hear you on that haha. It's funny that initially video games were called ""cathode ray tube Amusement devices""LOL that sucks all the fun out of them agent_2:That is a totally military name. too many words, too official sounding. pointless. agent_1:Have you ever visited South Korea? Apparently if you're under 16 it's illegal for you to play video games after midnight haha agent_2:I think that there is a video game craze there. plus there are games cafes that are open all night  agent_1:That sounds pretty cool. Did you ever play a video game based on Toy Story? Apparently Tom Hanks his brother, Jim Hanks, does all of the voices for Woody in the video games agent_2:that's great. Tom has enough money, and his brother could use the work. how would you like to be his brother? That would be tough, overshadowed by Tom"	agent_1:It would be tough but you're still making a lot of money haha. Have you ever played the Harry Potter video games or even LittleBigPlanet?

I tried to watch a couple of the movies but I couldn't get into them like some people do. agent_1:Did you know Netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth usage in North America from 9pm-12am? agent_2:I didn't know that but it doesn't surprise me. I guess its pretty popular around the world. agent_1:I guess so. Netflix and YouTube make up half the peak internet traffic in North America. agent_2:I watch more youtube than I do Netflix. Which do you prefer? agent_1:I prefer YouTube as well. Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth	agent_2:I think Neflix is over rated these days. It use to be pretty neat being able to stream movies. But then the cost went up and its not as awesome.

Are you a fan? agent_2:I have been to a few games, mostly New York Yankee games in the Bronx. agent_1:Well they Yankees are the most successful team of all time.  By far the most World Series wins.   agent_2:Bobby Richard on the Yankees was the only person to win a World Series MVP despite losing the series. agent_1:I can imagine that was bittersweet for him then.  Did you go to old Yankee Stadium or the new one that opened in 2009? agent_2:I have been to both stadiums. I suppose I am one of the numbers that support the Yankees having the second highest attendance. agent_1:Are you a Mets fan too?  I know they are not as popular as the Yankees but they have a big following too agent_2:I am definitely a bigger fan of the Mets. I like underdog stories. I never knew in 1974 they shared Shea Stadium with the Mets. agent_1:I think the Jets and Giants played at Shea at some point to.  Lots of work for the groundskeepers agent_2:I bet. It was around the same time in 1973 that two Yankee pitchers swapped families permanently. How unusual. agent_1:Probably the strangest baseball trade in MLB history.   agent_2:Haha that is very good. Speaking of strange the Ottoman Empire was still in existence the last time the Chicago cubs won the world series. agent_1:The Ottoman empire was in existence in 2016?  That does not seem accurate.  agent_2:I think it was the World Series won before 2016. Because according the the facts the Chicago Cubs were the first baseball team to win back to back world series and haven't won since, with exception to 2016. agent_1:I have to respect Cubs fans for sticking with the team for 100 years of losing	agent_2:Baseball is all about tradition.

Who's your favorite team? agent_1:I'm a Yankees fan, I never knew Babe Ruth was caught stealing home in the 1926 World Serires agent_2:It's surprising, you don't hear many bad things about Babe Ruth. I like the Dodgers therefore I am anti-yankee. agent_1:They had a great rivalry when both were in NY. It's crazy Babe Ruth would ever try to steal a base considering how big he was agent_2:I wonder how many stolen bases he had in his career. Maybe he thought he could just run the catcher over. agent_1:That would be an interesting fact to know. It's pretty crazy the Ottoman Empire was still around when the Cubs won back to back World Series agent_2:Yes the Cubs have suffered from the curse of the goat. agent_1:Who knew a man with a goat could wield such great power agent_2:Remind me not to make an enemy of anyone carrying a goat. I wonder if that's where the saying being a goat came from. Like Ruth was the goat after losing that game. agent_1:I don'tknow, maybe, Billy Sianis goat did stink	agent_2:Probably so.

Out of the 20 quintillion animal types on the planet, I don't think dragon's exist. agent_1:well not the ones I want.  But they do exist,  the kimodo dragon.  agent_2:Oh that's right. I forgot those little guys are still around. Did you know Germany is the first country in the world to give animals legal rights? agent_1:Yeah I think the kimodo dragon actually has its own island too lol I didnt know that,  what rights are those? agent_2:Yes, I think the do have an island. As for the legal rights, I'm not entirely sure but pretty much what humans have. agent_1:I see.  Did you know dogs have 12 blood types?   agent_2:No, I had no idea. That is interesting. Did you know animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated? agent_1:Is that every animal?  I never seen it on any of my dogs or fish.

They are rescues, really good cats but they seems to hate the movie Frozen. Did you know that was the first Disney film directed by a woman? agent_1:Nice,  my dog is a rescue.  I wonder why they hate frozen,  it has such good songs.  No I didnt know that.  agent_2:I don't know but they literally growl at the TV when its on. I guess they aren't Disney fans. I wonder if they would like the lion king. agent_1:Yeah show them something they might relate to,  cats.  did you know that wreck it ralph developement started in the 1980s,  took so long to get that movie finish,  turned out great though.  agent_2:I had no idea, that is a long time of development.

Think it was a good one?   agent_2:No. They gave up too much. Puig was a pain in the neck, but one of the best defensive left fielders in baseball. The pitcher wood was a young guy who was an all star 2 years ago agent_1:I was kind of surprised when they did that trade.  Did you know baseball managers wear uniforms because they can technically play if needed? agent_2:Yes. I remember Pete Rose and Frank Robinson doing that agent_1:Yes.  How about the guy who found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards that were hidden in his grandfathers attic since the 1940s.  I'm not ashamed to admit that I still a few packs of baseball cards every year.  It gives me the thrill I had when I was kid opening them. agent_2:Yes my base baseball cards were thrown out many many years ago. I wish I had those back agent_1:They were super huge there in the late 80s and early 90s but have died down in popularity since then.  Did you know kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada? agent_2:Yes. I had heard that before. agent_1:I don't know if I would like to schedule the games.  For 24 years a married couple scheduled all MLB games played each year. agent_2:That sounds like a heck of a big job. agent_1:I would want no part of it.

Did you know that the horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large single-toed animal of today?  agent_2:That makes it even more impressive that there are over 300 breeds of horses in the world today. agent_1:Yes, humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Some species were domesticated but then some are still living in the wild as feral horses. agent_2:I just heard that Icelandic horses have a fifth gear. Horses are simply fascinating. agent_1:Yes, I agree. There is an extensive specialized vocabulary used to described equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior. agent_2:What do you think about sharks? Did you know they're sister species to rays? agent_1:Yes, fascinating fact!. And sharks can be trained like dogs to bark. agent_2:I kinda feel bad for them. They have no rib cages so if they ever end up on land, they get crushed by the weight of their body. agent_1:Yes, sad indeed.

This year we recently had a bunch of hummingbirds..that was a first for me and so exciting. SO TINY.. agent_1:I also find it interesting that some birds can fly from alaska to north america without sleeping when they migrate. agent_2:Birds are very interesting because of a lot of facts.  I think it helps with their flight that their bones are hollow so not weighed down.  agent_1:Yes, they are interesting. I did not know that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. I find that very interersting. agent_2:I have watched them pull some to make them nearby.  The way they flit about is so beautiful to watch.  It is almost elegant like a dance. ..performing art! agent_1:Yes, did you know that Jackie Chan manages a k-pop band. I did not know that but i think it's cool. agent_2:It seems that so many you wouldn't think to have other interests do.  Jackie in music, Bruce Lee in dancing.  A championship even! agent_1:It seems to be in a kpop band you have to be tough because they go through bootcamps before being signed. agent_2:Boot camps for bands.. Guess it takes a lot of stamina for the dancing and singing.  Kind of the same I would assume for figure skating.  Can you imagine the work to land a triple axel? agent_1:That is true. It looks hard. Did you know babies spontaneously dance when they hear music. They are cute. agent_2:Music is a wonderful thing, so much to come out of it.  Symbiotic relationship with dance and music. Tupac was able to do both- never would have thought ballet for him though. agent_1:Yes, that definitely does not fit his image. I was surprised that ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week. That is a lot. agent_2:The tip starts to break down and doesn't hold form.  Same with skates, have to keep them sharp or can't get the edge for spins and jumps. Would have to assume that Nagasu goes through a lot of skates for this reason. agent_1:I like that she wanted to do the triple axel so bad that she dreamed she could . That shows heart for wanting to do something. agent_2:Especially when she had been passed over for the previous Olympics.  Rippon omitted his quad jump at the start, not as much heart I guess. agent_1:And she is part of the record books for being the first U.S. lady to land triple axel in olympic competition. agent_2:She had her wish of making America proud.  Guess the same can't be said for the Russians because of the prior doping scandal. agent_1:Yes, the doping scandal can be hard to come back from. It is amazing the amount of doping in sports today. agent_2:You would think that rather than compromising, like the Olympic committee did, they would just start to ban them.  Isn't teaching them anything to allow certain numbers to still participate and medal. agent_1:That's true. Did you know Michael Jackson had a patent on his leaning dance move. agent_2:I didn't know that there was a device involved in it.  Wonder with his death if the patent transferred to someone? agent_1:Maybe it got passed down to his children. agent_2:He certainly was talented.  Wonder if he did his own choreography? agent_1:I think he did. He worked too hard and I think that is what caused his death. He had his whole family to take care of really. agent_2:So much control.  At least after he left Jackson 5 he had some freedom unlike the kids in K pop. Agencies controlling everything. Yikes! agent_1:That is true and to think K-pop had it's first group of women in the 60's is surprising. I thought k-pop was pretty new. agent_2:I was vaguely familiar with H.O.T. , Korean version of Backstreet Boys. Social networking and YouTube have launched a lot of the Korean Wave. agent_1:Yes and they have the loudest and most loyal fans. agent_2:I wonder if because they are now going global with this music if you will start to see fusion music.  Would mix well with Latin beats. agent_1:I like that when North korea sank a south korean warship they blasted the k-pop song hit your heart on loud speakers. agent_2:I wonder if that song was by their own K pop girl band, moranbong,  or if they selected it from someone else? agent_1:Moranbong  band was  the most popular music group in the country. They must have a lot of fans. agent_2:It is generally classified that way..K Pop.  Seems to have a more narrow sense of description and influence than back when they were around though. agent_1:And they say with social media and tv  shows  k-pop are gaining a widespread global audience. agent_2:To think that   different styles and genres of music can influence modern culture to such an extent as to become an ""idol"" like culture is mind boggling. agent_1:Yes, and I did not realize that when they are in bootcamp they are charged for everything. So when they make it famous they have to pay it all back."	agent_2:Just like any other job, pay for the training.

I bet that is why they call them man's best friend.  agent_2:I guess so. They perform so many roles for humans, like hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, and companionship. I guess there's a reason why they are called that. They do a lot for humans. agent_1:Yeah. Apparently there are 12 different types of blood that a dog may have.  agent_2:I didn't know that. I wonder if they get good prizes at blood drives? agent_1:LOL, good question. Google prefers dogs to cats, did you know that?  agent_2:I did not know that.

I was stationed there for a few months so I didn't get to see too much. I didn't know that. I always thought that dogs were color blind, but they're not they just can't see as many different colors as humans.  agent_1:Yeah, that's what I've heard.

Yeah, I probably have luggage somewhere in ATL.  agent_2:If anything, all that does is show your lack of parenting skills...and alcohol problem. agent_1:Yeah, like that's a good solution -- getting lit.

I haven't played since I was in college...and even then I stunk. lol  I much prefer table tennis which is also called ping pong.  lol agent_1:pIng pong is fun. did you know that a A black man won the 1st us open tennis title in 1968 and no black man has won it since agent_2:I had no idea.  Maybe it was Arthur Ash?  I remember him from when I was a kid.  Up until 1978 a tennis player could use any object as a racket.  That would have been interesting to see what some might have used. agent_1:I was thinking Arthur Ash. I love the Polo shirts agent_2:I used too but am more of a tshirt guy now.  lol  Did you know that some consider grunting before a shot to be a form of cheating? agent_1:I never know that. I did know that They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 us open agent_2:That would have dried them fast.  Tennis generates good money, but not as much as soccer which makes more than all of the other big popular sports combined. agent_1:Roger Federer is a good player Federer has won 20 Grand Slam singles titles	agent_2:Wow.  Since beginning his career in 1998, that has to make him one of the best of all time?  	agent_1 likes sports. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'TV shows', 'TV character'].
9990	agent_1:Hey! Did you watch FIFA World cup the last summer? agent_2:Hey yeah I caught some of it. I love it because it is an international competition! agent_1:I'm wondering about 2022 in Qatar. They even didn't build city for the final. It's small country actually. agent_2:Yeah they better get going. They promised air conditioned arenas that would reduce temps by 30 degrees celsius! agent_1:But I guess the decision to make it not in the summer 2022, but in low season like February or November. However, there is conflict with major championships. Anyway it would be fun. Do you watch tennis? agent_2:Yeah I definitely enjoy watching tennis. Back in 1978 they could use anything for a racket-that would make it more interesting! agent_1:Do you know that the longest match in history was 11 hours or about 3 days to play? It's incredible!!! agent_2:Wow they must have been exhausted. Whereas the longest point was a 643 point rally lasting 29 minutes! agent_1:I guess if in 2019 they make video how a helicopter is used to dry the glass tennis courts, it is going to be viral everywhere! haha agent_2:Oh that is so cool I wanna look that up! Ping pong is like tennis but it isn't the sports name.

7438	agent_1: Hello,  did you know that more than 80% of the earths forests have been destroyed? agent_2:That is sad. I hope we can reverse that  statistic.  agent_1:Yeah that is really sad.  I recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century.  agent_2:I also think it is interesting that when earth was formed, a day was only 5.5 hours long. I wonder why that changed? agent_1:I don't know,  maybe it slowed its rotation eventually?  That's pretty weird.   agent_2:Do you believe in aliens? The UN appointed ambassadors to extraterrestrials.  agent_1:Yes,  definitely.  Thats cool lol at least they are prepared!  Do you believe in aliens? agent_2:I am not sure. I feel like there is more life out there. I wonder if they will make contact with earth?	agent_1:Im assuming so,  otherwise what would the ambassador have to study?  lol how else can he be prepared if theres no evidence?	agent_2 likes work. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['work', 'history', 'day length'].
4760	agent_1:It is amazing how a certain scent can ellict specific memories from throughout your life isn't it? agent_2:I know, I can catch a faint smell of something and be reminded of something from 20 years ago. agent_1:Yes, like a summer rain always reminds me of walking through the woods as a boy.  It's too bad we can't replicate those scents and be reminded of our childhood all of the time. agent_2:I've never thought about it, but I suppose we don't have names for smells, just where it comes from. agent_1:That's true I refer to a damp basement smell as moldy but why not refer to the smell of onions as 'yuk'? agent_2:It's difficult to imagine having names for each smell, as we have for colors.  I'd think there were too many. agent_1:Yes, but imagine if the defining term could relate to the listener not only what the smell was precisely but perhaps even it's location. Maybe other languages allow for more descriptive labels. agent_2:I suppose if you have to survive, partially because of your nose, it makes sense to be very specific. agent_1:I would think so. I suppose it has validity to convey something with just one word that lets everyone know everything about it. I think it might be difficult if you were to use a smell word with someone who had never smelled that scent before. agent_2:The Semaq Beri speakers take it seriously, especially with the brother and sister thing.  They'd struggle in the city. agent_1:Ha! They would indeed. It is funny how different cultures have taboos that make no sense to anyone but them. Whenever I smell a certain perfume I find myself back in time to my school days and the girl I used to love.	agent_2:I guess we have the ability to use our noses in the same way, we just don't have the need.  There's not the peril for us.	agent_1 dislikes smell. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['smell', 'travel', 'family'].
7817	agent_1:Game of Thrones seems like one of the most popular TV shows...and it has been for a few years, too, right? agent_2:Yeah about 5 or 6 years now.  You dont watch it? agent_1:No, but I really want to. I haven't even bought cable TV. I have watched Game of Thrones at friends' houses, though. agent_2:Oh thats good,  you should catch up the last season is coming out in april and thats it the show will be done.  agent_1:I really need to catch up on it. I also have no idea what's going on this year with the World Series Baseball. agent_2:The actress that plays Arya actually has never been in anything before.  what a break!  First time acting and gets Game of Thrones! agent_1:Is Arya the one that has all the gorgeous fierce dragons on Game of Thrones? agent_2:No.  Arya is the little girl,  she looks like a boy,  on purpose.  agent_1:I heard that Ireland finances the Game of Throne series because it's filmed there and they get a good boost of tourism through that. Sounds good to me! agent_2:Yes, My aunt and cousin went to visit it last summer,  the pics were amazing! agent_1:Did you know that Charlie Chaplin's Granddaughter plays Talisa Maegyr in the Game of Thrones? I wonder if she has many lines? agent_2:I did know that but I dont recognize the name at all so I guess she is not a main character.  agent_1:Do they have other cool creatures in the Game of Thrones show besides dragons? I'd love to see unicorns and other things too! agent_2:Giant wolves that are called Direwolvles,  White walkers (like dead zombies but frozen one),  Giants.  	agent_1:WOW! Sounds so cool!

Definitely have giants in that game too. 	agent_2 likes hobby. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobby', 'TV shows', 'ending of a show'].
11368	"agent_1:Did you listen to Led Zeppelin?  There's a new book out about them.   agent_2:I was not aware of that. Have you heard it? agent_1:It's a book.  They do have many good albums.  I remember Houses of the Holy the most.  agent_2:I know they were hugely popular. They were a bit before my time. I do kind of like ""stairway to Heaven"". agent_1:That song got sooooo much airplay and some their best didn't.  This last book actually is actually from the remaining 3 members. agent_2:I enjoy books like that. It is interesting to get insight into great bands. agent_1:This one may be good.  It has a diverse set of photos from all kinds of sources.   agent_2:Very cool.

7715	"agent_1:Hi, how are you? agent_2:Great, how are you? agent_1:I am well. Do you believe in aliens? agent_2:The one's from space? Not likely to have happened, though there is life on other planets. What about you? agent_1:Not really. I am not even remotely interested in space so I usually ignore that stuff. X-files on the other hand... agent_2:The aliens missed their colonization date. Why so close to Christmas? I guess the winter solstice is a good date. agent_1:What a bunch of downers. At least we have will smith to protect us! agent_2:Did you know that over 80 percent of the Earth's forests have already been destroyed? Maybe the aliens will be appalled at the destruction and leave. agent_1:Or our level of stupidity and move on so we don't ruin their planet.  agent_2:In September 2010, the UN appointed an ambassador to extraterrestrials in case they make contact with us. I wonder how you quality for THAT job. Seems like there would be little to do. agent_1:Yeah. I am not sure that's a full-time job. ""Any aliens today?"" ""No."" ""See you tomorrow!"" agent_2:There seems to be more pressing problems. Earth will be helium-free by the end of the 21st century. Where will we get helium for our balloons? Maybe the aliens will bring some for us.  agent_1:Can helium be created in a lab? On a personal note, I have two helium balloons stuck in my vaulted ceiling. That helium lasts for at least 3 weeks. It is getting tiresome.] agent_2:In 2007 Tom Cruise spent millions on an underground bunker to protect himself from aliens. Maybe he knows some of the firefighters trained in treating aliens, in the event of a UFO crash. Or maybe he has a secret helium source. agent_1:As long as he is not jumping on the couches in his bunker, I am fine with it. He seems a little weird... agent_2:Speaking of weird, the world's longest name is a story about a shepherd protecting his sheep and humanity from aliens. Who has this name, and why? Are the parents X-files fans? agent_1:Aliens were based of creatures found in the ocean? I feel like there is a lot in the ocean we do not know about."	agent_2:We haven't been around very long.

6298	"agent_1:Hi there!  Are you a baseball fan? agent_2:Not really.  I find the sport difficult to watch and slow.  What about you? agent_1:I like it.  I think because it just it's something that always makes me think of warm weather and summer time.  Did you know they call kickball soccer-baseball in Canada? agent_2:It is nice to sit outside and watch a baseball game in warm weather. I agree.  I didn't know they call kickball ""soccer-baseball"" in Canada.  That is funny. agent_1:I wonder why they call it that.  I'm always wondered why baseball managers wear uniforms...I guess they can play for their teams if needed.  Interesting. agent_2:Do you know who the baseball player Angel Hernandez is? agent_1:He is actually an umpire.  He has a bad reputation for blowing calls. agent_2:That's what I heard.  And he tried to accuse the Yankees and Joe Torre of discrimination against him.  I think being an umpire must be difficult"	agent_1:I wouldn't want to be one.

I love how they have these applied arts programs to bring them balance and something different and meaningful to them. agent_1:I heard that since his time, Duke has grown to have 98 student arts groups. agent_2:That is really amazing, love this idea. they have so many more classes directed at the arts now more than ever which is awesome.  agent_1:I wonder how many programs are devoted to the acoustic piano? agent_2:I love the piano, but not sure how many programs are devoted to it. by aligning art making with research it makes for a much deeper learning experience though. agent_1:I am a fan too.    Odd that the modern piano has been around since roughly 1700! agent_2:Right! L played years ago, and I also love poetry. Everyone should have a creative side they let out. It is amazing that they found a piano at the top of britains highest mountain....crazy to think how it got up there lol agent_1:It is funny that they test pianos with Circus Galop, a piece no human could play! agent_2:Hahaha, that is odd! I love researching fun facts on the computer and you can find so much! I use my computer for everything, I write some poetry and save it to my computer.....you could probably find a program to teach you piano on the computer lol.	agent_1:Perhaps so.

9140	agent_1:hi how are you? do you like mars? it is a planet, one of many. agent_2:I think Mars is fascinating! agent_1:mars really is a killer planet. it is red, red as all get out. plus it is associated with war. that is cool. agent_2:It gets its name from the God of War.   agent_1:that is the coolest god of them all. i would like to get that job. mars is the fourth planet from the sun but it is tops in my book. it might seem small but it is huge to me. would you want to live there? agent_2:Maybe, I hear there is a colonization project planned for 2023 agent_1:yes, i want to see who goes there and how much they get paid. it is a crazy job i think. agent_2:Agreed.    Did you hear about the satellite lost on mars? agent_1:yes that was typical of us companies to use the wrong system of measurement. nobody uses imperial except maybe beer makers. maybe the guys were talking about beer? LOL agent_2:Quite possible.  Or distracted by the selfies they were posting to facebook.  Here's me and the rover!  :) agent_1:boy, those selfies on mars are really a distraction. i guess the IT guys on mars are never going to hear the end of the problems with the net, since the Cloud is back on earth. agent_2:So very true.  I wonder if the like button would be  legal on mars.  There are parts of Germany where it isnt. agent_1:if germany gets to mars first, they'll probably ban the like button for the entire planet! agent_2:Zuckerburg probably has problems with Mars- he has red-green colorblindness.  Thats why facebook is blue.	agent_1:he will spend money to find a cure for r-g colorblindness. or he will upload his consciousness into a machine with better vision. he will prevail in the battle against death.	agent_2 likes movie. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'beer', 'technology'].

Did you know that polo shirts were invented for tennis and only later adopted by polo players? agent_2:Ha! That's weird! I didn't know that! Tennis has an interesting history. Did you know that until 1978, a tennis player could use any object as a racket? agent_1:Nice!  I wonder if anyone ever tried to use something wacky?  A black man won the 1st US open tennis title in 1968 and no black man has won it since. agent_2:Wow! Not since 1968? You know, Serena Williams has increasingly found her voice and spoken out against gender and racial inequality.  agent_1:Yes!  Did you know that she speaks fluent French and Italian, as does her sister Venus!	agent_2:She is truly fascinating! She does it all! She is the first tennis player, male or female, to achieve the career Golden Slam in both singles and doubles.

2537	agent_1:Hello, are you a big Netflix person? agent_2:I am!  I have been a subscriber for years and especially love the original content! agent_1:I do as well! Were you a subscriber even back when their whole business model was about DVD rental by mail and not an online platform? agent_2:I was! I think it was in 2007 when they started adding streaming features. agent_1:It's interesting to think how differently the company could have been if decisions played out differently. Like Blockbuster declining to buy them many times, and now they're worth many times over. agent_2:Exactly! A purchase of $50 million that is now worth $2 billion. That is just CRAZY! agent_1:And I feel like that doesn't even big to desribe how huge Netflix is still. Netflix accounts for a third of ALL bandwith in North America from 9pm to 12 am! agent_2:Which is honestly just nuts. And when you combine Netflix and youtube, it's half of the peak internet traffic in North America alone! agent_1:I was surprised to learn recently though, that despite how huge their online platform is, they still do DVD rentals! And spend 20 times more on postage than their bandwith. agent_2:True - but I think they might need to start paying more attention to what they are spending - they racked up $21.9 billion in debt as of Sept 2017 trying to get content! agent_1:That's certainly a lot of money! Although at least it's an investment and will come back to them. On the other hand, I remember a decade ago, Tom Cruise spent $10 million on an underground bunker to protect himself from aliens, what a nut. agent_2:I stopped liking him when he went all about Scientology. I much prefer other actors now, like Peter Dinklage. agent_1:I've never heard of him, does he do a lot of action movies? I like Tom Cruise because of movies like Top Gun and Cocktail but I'm always interested in expanding my preferences. agent_2:Actually, Peter Dinklage plays Tyrion Lannister on Game of Thrones! 	agent_1:Oh wow!

10044	"agent_1:Have you ever seen Keeping up with the Kardashians?  agent_2:Yes, I know bits and pieces. I know Kim was born 10-21-80.  agent_1:Yeah, it's basically just her and her family doing everyday life things. Did you know she named her baby Chicago? agent_2:I did know. It is a nod to Kanye's hometown and the city is special to K & K  so the name is perfect because baby Chicago was hard to conceive so she is extra special as well.  agent_1:That's a pretty sweet meaning. Did you know Kim used to be Paris Hilton's personal assistant?  agent_2:I did know. That is how she first gained media attention but after her 2003 sex tape was leaked in 2007 she really became popular. agent_1:That agent_2:I know one of my kids used to play the Kim Kardashian app on their phone. I think it came out in 2014. agent_1:Sorry about that, I accidentally pressed enter. I haven't used the app, but I have heard of it. She was also in a fall out boy music video. I wonder which song? agent_2:I did not know she was in a music video. I know after the 2007 sex tape leak she and her family began appearing on E! reality TV show Keeping up With the Kardashians. agent_1:Yeah, that's a really lucky break for releasing a sex tape. I'm pretty sure her mom released it on purpose.  agent_2:Maybe. I know Kim is on the 2015 Time Magazine's list of 100 most influential people. agent_1:She definitely has a lot of influence. She recently met with trump to discuss prison reform.   agent_2:I did not know that, but good for her. I know she also has a book about how she is a trailblazer of the selfie movement. agent_1:Yeah, she's definitely a busy and hardworking person. Speaking of celebrities, did you know Judge Judy makes $123,000 an episode? agent_2:Holy cow! That is a lot of money! I wonder where she rates on Hollywood's likability ""q score""? I know Tom Hanks rates a 48, while Kim's is a -71, which is hilarious. agent_1:I've never heard of a q-score, but it sounds really interesting. I think most of the Kardashians are probably not good in relations to likability.  agent_2:I would have to agree. I know critics and admirers have described her as exemplifying the notion of being famous for being famous. agent_1:Yeah, she doesn't have a lot of actual talents. Just being wealthy and now famous. They are always coming up with new ways to stay in the spotlight. agent_2:Yes, I agree. Although she is reported to be the highest-paid reality personality of 2015 with her total earnings exceeding $53 million."	agent_1:Yeah, I guess I would do some silly stuff like that if I was making that much money off of it.

Did you know video games were orignally used by the military?  agent_2:No I didnt, I always thought they were used for entertainment although I know the millitary use them currently agent_1:I know, it was probably for some type of war game.  agent_2:What are your thoughts on the name ''Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Devices'' ?	agent_1:I play them every now and then.

Did you know that Apple had a clothing line back in 1986? agent_2:No I didn't know that. I wonder what those clothes look like? They're probably very colorful like the pilgrims original clothes, not the black clothes that they wore for special occasions agent_1:I wonder what apples clothing line looked like too. And speaking of Pilgrims, I thought that it was the exact opposite as what you said. I guess it is just me. agent_2:A lot of things are the opposite of what you would think. Like how ripcurl says on their clothes that they are made in China when in fact they are made in North Korea agent_1:I am not suprised that they tried to keep that a secret. I do not think anyone would buy something that was made in North Korea! agent_2:Nope I definitely would not! I also wouldn't buy clothes from unclaimed baggage, there's a store in Alabama that actually sells that stuff agent_1:Really? I would not trust that store.

That's why they wear the uniforms agent_1:Yeah that is,  considering theres like 20 players on the team,  I think its safe to say the manager can just not suit up lol  agent_2:Haha that's a good point. Do you know what they call kickball in Canada agent_1:I read it but I dont remember lol  agent_2:Haha well they call it soccer-baseball, a very dumb name in my opinion LOL agent_1:maybe they should shorten it to like socball lol  sounds better to me.  agent_2:Lol that does sound a lot better actually. Can you imagine if you found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in your attic. I would probably have a heart attack agent_1:i would go on vacations!  Like a really nice one,  then save or invest the rest.  I wish my family collected something cool like that.   agent_2:Yep I agree. Did you know that baseball is super popular in Japan? agent_1:who wouldve thought!   agent_2:I know right. I guess a lot of Japanese are confused in knowing that it is America's national pastime. but we created the game so that's why it's so weird haha agent_1:Yeah really.  Do you watch game of thrones? agent_2:I do like Game of Thrones. What about you? I can't wait for the new season to start in April agent_1:seriously!!! Im re watching all of the season to prepare for it hahaha  agent_2:Yep I need to do that too! I love that Peter Dinklage has won three Emmy Awards. He does a great job in that show agent_1:he does a great of making us hate him lol I really love Tyrion.  agent_2:Tyrion is awesome haha. It's great that the show has gotten a total of 47 Emmys as well. I even got three Hugo Awards. I just need to know how the show ends haha.	agent_1:yes I definitely want to see how this crazy show ends,  and I want to see what spin off they will make,  i would really like a tv show about the targaryens!	agent_2 likes TV show. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV show', 'Hugo Awards', 'TV show title'].

I have lived here my entire life. agent_2:LOL, did you know that the earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century?  agent_1:I wonder why that is. where does helium come from and where does it go? we will have to find a solution to that. agent_2:I'm not actually sure. I'm actually not even sure if that is true.  agent_1:Yeah, sometimes the facts that i encounter in this vicinity of the internet seem a little less than factish.  agent_2:Yup, I can't disagree there. Did you know the UN already has an ambassador to aliens?  agent_1:I wonder who decided that was necessary. and how much of the budget goes to cover that job. how do i get that job? agent_2:I'm not sure. It sounds sort of iffy to me.  agent_1:Yeah, i guess they need a background in science, and maybe a ton of political connections. LOL agent_2:Hilarious, yeah, who knows? Or maybe they are just some weirdo? 	"agent_1:Yeah. ""Hey, that guy is a nutter, but we cant fire him. Alien ambassador?

Did you know baseball managers wear uniforms because they can technically play if needed? agent_2:ohh nice.. A 3 million $ worth of 1900s baseball cards in his baseball games played each yr agent_1:Wow that's crazy. Kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada. agent_2:hmm its also crazy..  what abt shoe? agent_1:I like shoes. Do you? agent_2:i love shoe.. i have 30 pairs of shoe.. agent_1:Wow that's a lot of shoes. Marbury promoted a line of shoes that retailed at $15. agent_2:which shoe brand u like? agent_1:I love Nike. What about you? agent_2:i like adidas  agent_1:Adidas is good too. Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of ballet shoes per week.	agent_2:hmm yah.. 5000 yr old shoe perform better than modern shoes	agent_1 dislikes history. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['history', 'sports', 'favorite sport'].

Did You hear that Bruce lee was also a great dancer and he won the hong kong cha-cha championship in 1958 ? agent_2:I did hear that.  Emilia clarke did the funky chicken and robot dance at the audition for daenerys targaryen. agent_1:I am such a big fan of hers!  agent_2:Did you know that there was an episode of mr. rogers where he learned to breakdance agent_1:I would love to see that. Did You see a movie about him ? I've heard it's good. agent_2:No, I haven't seen it but watched his show growing up. agent_1:I'm from Poland and I got here like 16 years ago... I've never seen it but I admire who he is and what he did... agent_2:That's cool.  I've never been to Poland.  There are ballet slippers that make drawings from the dancer's movements agent_1:Probably looks like a 2year old drawing :) agent_2:Probably, the first moonwalk ever recorded was performed by tap dancer bill bailey in 1955! agent_1:...so it's not MJ who invented it ? agent_2:I guess not.  He must have taken it and run with it though....and screamed also agent_1:lol ;) but that walk got famous just because Michael ;)  agent_2:Absolutely it did.  That dude could dance. agent_1:Yes he did ! and sing ;)  ...and I don't believe to all that nasty stuff they were saying about him...  agent_2:There has been some rough stuff said about him for sure. agent_1:yes... but once he paid... everything was fine... sorry, if something happened to my child, no money in the world would make it fine... that's why I don't believe in that... agent_2:Money makes people crazy seems like.

6467	agent_1:Hi, how are you? agent_2:Good! Did you know Kristen Stewart from the Twilight movies helped author a paper about AI? Not just a pretty face! agent_1:Wow, I had no idea! That's pretty cool. Isn't that one lady from Bri bang also like a pHd? agent_2:I'm not sure but wouldn't doubt it. Facebook is developing AI designed to better understand emotions, identify objects, and predict user actions. Yikes.  agent_1:Clifford seems to be a great way to augment teaching. I would like to see a pre and post test with a control group to see how well the AI works.	agent_2:Interesting.

7131	agent_1:hi how are you? do you use amazon? agent_2:Hello I am doing great! I do, a little more than I want to though, how about you? agent_1:I sometimes use it, when i dont have time to shop. i like to check things out in the store, if possible. agent_2:It's sad but I have turned into the complete opposite! I only go to the store if it's not on amazon haha. I wish I was the first customer to buy something though! agent_1:I would rather have amazon prime for life than a building named after me.  agent_2:Haha I would like that as well haha. Can you believe how many miles a day an Amazon worker walks a day? agent_1:I think that they must lose a lot of weight, or get really bad knees LOL agent_2:I bet! I didn't even know IMDB was owned by Amazon too. They have the hand in every cookie jar haha. agent_1:Yeah, soon amazon will own everything and we will all work at amazon. 15 miles a day. can i do that at my age? LOL agent_2:I'm only 30 and am dreading that just thinking about it lol. Maybe Google will try and stop them? agent_1:Google and amazon will merge. all searches will produce amazon results. you will use your wages from google or amazon to buy goods online from amazon. agent_2:It's like the movie terminator! SKYNET IS OUT TO GET US!!!! haha it really is crazy how much stake Google has in the internet. agent_1:google dominates, but there is always some upstart that unseats the dominant firm. i wonder who that will be. agent_2:Well Google falls under Alphabet now, so I feel like they are getting prepared for that! agent_1:Yes, from A to Z, they will control everything. oh, well. i for one hail our new corporate overlords.	agent_2:Apple even has a big piece of everything.

63	agent_1:Hey what's up do use Google very often?I really love the company and was surprised to hear that it was founded back in 1998. agent_2:i think everyone must use it daily! its become ingrained in every day life agent_1:Agreed. The Google headquarters in Mountain View California is nicknamed the Google Plex. agent_2:thats funny. The current CEO is Sundar Pichai, i didnt know Larry Page was replaced agent_1:Oh yeah I didn't know that either. I also want to go to google Plex to see the goats who mow their lawn by eating it. agent_2:say what now?? they have that?? agent_1:Yeah apparently lol! They do that instead of hiring people to mow! agent_2:thats both funny and i guess imaginative. leave it to a huge tech company to employ actual goats! agent_1:Yeah exactly I am sure they are cheaper. One thing I bet they couldn't exploit is fish. I think fish are so cool there is actually a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.	agent_2:i had rememered hearing about that before.

11536	agent_1:Are you a fan of Disney films? agent_2:yes,definitely i like Disney film  agent_1:Glad to hear it. Did you know that The Lion King was the first Disney film to be dubbed in Zulu for it's African release? agent_2:Yes i know a little bit this film Directed by Roger Allers, Rob Minkoff. With Matthew Broderick is it right. agent_1:I'm honestly not sure who directed it. I was quite young when it came out. The main character was Simba, a lion. Speaking of directors, did you know that Frozen was the first animated Disney film directed by a woman.  agent_2:yes,Frozen, for which she earned an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Lee is the first female director agent_1:Yes that is correct. I'm glad to see that they did that but sad that it took them so long. I see a lot of Disney toys. Did you also know that the toy industry gets involved in Disney films before the beginning of the film's production? agent_2:I don't know about it please explain the details agent_1:They prepare to make toys before the movie has even began filming. I was wondering how toys came out so quickly to promote a movie.  agent_2:I also think about it. agent_1:Also, apparently in the 70's Disney recycled a lot of animation frames so there are identical scenes in some movies. I am going to have to look out for those.  agent_2:okay,do you like dog? agent_1:I do like dogs. I also like cats. I like all animals really ha ha.  agent_2:Do you have them at home?	agent_1:I have cats.

6558	agent_1:How's it going? Do you know much about VR? Looks like it is not meeting it's potential as an educational tool agent_2:Hello there, I know just a little bit, I heard that is true though, that they don't really have the ability to customize the material to the individual or coach.  agent_1:That seems odd and something that would be easy to fix if the effort was put in. Learning history and geography seems like a perfect fit for VR agent_2:Yeah I think you are right, especially for those children that are strong visual learners.  agent_1:VR does sound like a great tool for those who struggle with time limits agent_2:Yeah I think it has the potential to be.  Do you know much about AI? agent_1:Not much except for what's in pop culture, I definitely couldn't explain Tesler's Theorem that well agent_2:I think I'm about the same, I know IBM's Watson is very helpful in the medical field.   agent_1:Yea I've heard of Watson and a little about Stanford's ai class which I might have to take a look at when I got the time agent_2:Did you know the actress Kristen Stewart co-authored a paper on AI? agent_1:No, I had no clue. I don't know if I'm more surprised of that or the first vr game being made in 1968 agent_2:Holy cow, I never would have guessed that about VR.  Did you know doctors are using it to treat phobias? agent_1:Yea, I've heard of that, very cool. Lockheed Martin uses VR to tour Mars which is pretty cool also agent_2:Wow, that would be pretty cool to try, I wonder what you have to do to be a part of that?	agent_1:I don't know, maybe be in a smart class or just be in a school that is nearby a Lockheed Martin facility	agent_2 dislikes education. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['education', 'technology', 'visual learners'].
12158	agent_1:Hi there!  Do you follow or enjoy tennis at all?  I play it a lot more than I follow it, but I do know that Roger Federer has the most Grand Slam titles in history! agent_2:I do, Juan Martin del Potro is one of my favorite players, do you know who he is? and Federer is a great player as well I really like him agent_1:I do not know much about Juan Martin del Potro.  I do know that he is Argentinian and a former US Open champion. agent_2:His a great player  he has played against Federer a couple of times, he was the champion back in 2009 as well agent_1:He is a good example of determination.  I know he had some struggles with wrist injuries and had to have a lot of surgeries.  To reach the pinnacle of the game after that is incredible! agent_2:Its been hard, 4 surgeries can really make you quite, but I guess it paid off and with hard work he was able to make it, Rafael Nadal also had a new injury agent_1:Nadal is a great player too.  Crazy to think that 56% of grand slam titles have gone to him, Djokovic, or Federer since 2000. agent_2:Really talented players, legends of the game, Federer is the first person in Switzerland to be honored with a official stamp	agent_1:That is great.

Much cooler than,  say, playing the accordion...  agent_1:Do you play any instruments? I gave up videogames and started playing the piano a couple years ago, and I haven't looked back since haha	agent_2:No, unless you count an mp3 player.  I do love music except of stuff like accordions.  I definitely wouldn't pay $25 a ticket for that kind of music.

9100	agent_1:hey did you know a robot can now be programmed to debone a chicken? agent_2:Interesting. There is even a robotic arm that a paralyzed woman controls with her thoughts. agent_1:wow that is cool, do you Like Michael Jackson? He wanted to build a 50 foot robot haha agent_2:That sounds pretty wild. I think the mars robots are cute. The Curiosity sings happy birthday to itself on its birthday. agent_1:haha they are cute! did you ever watch Mythbusters? I guess they created a robot sidekick on that show agent_2:I do watch that sometimes but have not seen that episode. I guess the idea of chess playing robots have been around for awhile. Napoleon and Benjamin Franklin lost chess games to a robot, but it wasn't really a robot. A person was hidden inside.  agent_1:haha I remember hearing about that, one thing I'm glad is the US military uses xbox 360 controllers for the eod robots, thats probably cost savings agent_2:Do you worry about robots getting minds of their own? Megatron, a fictional character, was the leader of a civil rights group on Cybertron that wanted equal rights for all robots. agent_1:haha yes I would worry about that, especially now they are putting rat brains into robots, that is scary! agent_2:Really? That is strangely awesome. Have you heard of the home robot Amazon is building? I need one. agent_1:no I haven't, do you know anything about it it sounds awesome! all I know is amazon actually owns imdb, you know that movie site agent_2:Oh, interesting! They are into all types of niches. This project has been many years in the making and it's called the Vesta. We might be able to get it next year, but the robot will likely become a roving Alexa. Unfortunately, it probably won't be a housekeeper. agent_1:ah thats too bad because thats what I need! Would you work at an Amazon warehouse? I guess a worker can walk up the 15 miles a day from their shift work agent_2:I would love to work at an Amazon warehouse. I think it might get me into shape! In the future that job will probably be done by robots but for now, it's even hard to train a robot to pick up a coffee mug, a task that is incredibly easy for humans. agent_1:haha thats what I think too, and I do wish I were the first person to order on amazon, only $28 and you could have had a building named after you!	agent_2:Nice! I think we will see Amazon come out with a factory floor robot sooner than one that has to adapt to a landscape that changes constantly because of dirty laundry and kids clothes.	agent_1 likes technology. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['technology', 'TV show', 'robot'].
8712	agent_1:Hey have you ever seen the movie Halloween? Or even the newest one with Jamie Lee Curtis agent_2:I have not. I like her. But I don't really like horror films. Have you? agent_1:No I saw the original one but I didn't see the newest one, my friend side and said it was really bad so I wanted to see your opinion agent_2:Ok, I do like SOME horror, but I usually pick and choose. I liked The Shining, The Omen, The Exorcist. Rosemary's Baby. What about you? agent_1:Yeah those are all good movies. I also liked Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street. The new Halloween note took in about $89 in only 3 days, so it was definitely popular agent_2:I haven't seen those. I think that remakes are risky. The comparisons are inevitable. agent_1:Yep it's always hard to beat the original. And yes the new Halloween movie is actually being released on the 40th anniversary of the release of the first one agent_2:I would rather watch the original. It probably has charm. The new one is probably too slick.  agent_1:Yeah I think the original is going to be the best. Did you know that Stephen King actually thinks that the movie Bambi should be a horror movie? agent_2:He was traumatized as a child. That movie did have death, so it could be scary. Anyway, he turned his trauma into a career. agent_1:Well that's really good for him! Do you think that horror movies actually burn almost 200 calories per movie? If so I should watch more to lose weight LOL agent_2:I wonder if the effect wears off. No surprise, no tension. I would rather exercise. By the way, do you like horses? agent_1:No I don't like horses I'm actually allergic to them LOL and apparently so is Clint Eastwood agent_2:I have never ridden a horse. I would like to. Is it hard? I figure you have to take lessons or something. agent_1:Yeah you do have to learn, it's actually very uncomfortable even in a saddle, I think it's cool that Dalmatians were used with firehouses in order to calm the horses back before fire trucks agent_2:I've heard that the dogs were deaf. I wonder if that's true. agent_1:I think some Dalmatians are born deaf but not all of them are, what do you think about the high school students who rode horses to school? The high school had a no vehicle policy at the time, and so they rode horses instead lol agent_2:I think they were cheeky for doing so, but I admire their chutzpah. agent_1:Yep I can admire that, I would never have done that as a kid haha. It's interesting that Clint Eastwood was not always allergic to horses but developed it once he hit midlife agent_2:I don't think I have an allergy to them. Anyway, great chat!	agent_1:Well don't spend too much time around horses just in case you develop a allergy to them LOL I wish I didn't have the allergy	agent_2 likes hobby. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobby', 'movie', 'food'].
6217	agent_1:Hi, are you a baseball fan? My favorite team is the Yankees, they have been around since 1901 agent_2:Yes, Phillies my team.  Yankees lost me a bet for a $1 with my grandma when I was very young so I gave up on them.  Did you know that Roberto Osuna hasn't pitched since May 6 serving a 75 game suspension agent_1:I knew he was suspended but not for that long,what team is he on now? agent_2:I believe the Astros agent_1:Oh, I knew he was on the blue jays, that's a pretty high risk trade considering Osuna violated the domestic violence policy agent_2:Yes.  Apparently the Yankees trade with the Reds for Chapman before the 2016 season when Chapman was set to serve a suspension for a domestic abuse incident is similar agent_1:Yea, I remember that, although Chapman is a great closer I wish the Yankees wouldn't of traded for him in 2016 due to his incidents agent_2:It seems risky.  But the Astros seemed to want a late-inning reliever badly enough to get Osuna  agent_1:Yea, as former world series champions they started to get worried they only had a 4 game lead in their division	agent_2:Did you know that a married couple scheduled all the major league games for 24 years up until 2005	agent_1 likes sports. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'soccer team', 'sports'].

What about you? agent_2:no not really. my kids do though. did you know the creator of atrari made chuckie chese to get kids to play games? agent_1:Really!??? That's so interesting! What a crazy idea to get people to play video games? agent_2:Video gaming wasn't as big then! I remeber my kids playing mortal kombat. Do you know that why they started rating video games? agent_1:Mortal combat is why they started rating video games? That seems like a benign game though. agent_2:It does now, but when it first came out? It seemed really violent.

The first cloned pet was a cat and its name was copy cat agent_2:That's interesting and a little funny.  I had no idea of this, but the cat is the most popular pet in the world.  DId you know that? agent_1:Wow, no I didn't know that.  There are more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia. agent_2:Now that I had no idea of.  Did you know that some tarantulas keep frogs as pets? agent_1:Wow, that's odd. Two of the most popular pets are dogs and cats agent_2:I have dogs and used to have cats too but dogs are my favorite.   agent_1:Dogs are my favorite also.  I hope to get another one in the future. agent_2:Do you have any now?  I have two. agent_1:No, I do not.  What kind do you have?  84 per cent of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish agent_2:I have a beagle and a border collie.  I had no idea about that with the zebrafish. I wonder if cures can be found by using their genes. agent_1:I used to have a collie named Bimbo.  That's a great question. agent_2:Mine is named Cute Stuff.  Did you know about the fish that lives on land? I wonder what it is. agent_1:No, I didn't.  There is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal agent_2:Seriously?  I thought they just evaporated in the sun? agent_1:Absolutely, There are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth. agent_2:And who knows how many that are undiscovered.  Animals are truly fascinating! agent_1:Yes, they are.  In 2002, germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights. agent_2:I think that is a good thing!

7775	agent_1:Hello, do you watch baseball> agent_2:I am a fan of baseball - I used to know the married couple who scheduled all 2430 baseball games every year agent_1:Wow, I guess those are the people that you can call mega fans. I am not the biggest baseball fan although I do go to a few games each year agent_2:Yes baseball is so popular in Japan many people are surprised to find that it is our national game agent_1:I would be surprised too. Kickball is known as soccer-baseball in Canada. That is odd. agent_2:Yes.  I have had a few baseball cards in my day, but one lucky man found his grandfather had saved 3 million dollars worth of cards! agent_1:3 million is probably more money that I will ever have. The only things that my grandparents collect are rocks from their childhood. I do no think that those rocks will ever be worth 3 million! agent_2:laugh for sure!  Maybe you should try to be a team manager - they wear uniforms because theoretically they could put themselves in the game and play! agent_1:Really ? Although I do not think any of them have ever stepped in. I think that the actual players are much better than the coaches.  agent_2:No doubt but it would be fun to see one to step in for an inning - perhaps in the world series championship game agent_1:Speaking of the world series, the Ottoman Empire still existed since the last time that the Chicago cubs won the world series! agent_2:That was until a few years ago!  That was a great year.  The curse of the goat! agent_1:What is the curse of the goat? Is it some kind of superstition? agent_2:The Cubs did not let a man bring his goat into a baseball game around 1918 and he put a curse on them.  It lasted almost a hundred years! agent_1:Ah, thank you. Speaking of the cubs, they were the very first team to win the world series back to back and they have not won since!	agent_2:Yes - even famous players can blow it sometimes too - Babe Ruth was caught stealing in game 7 and it caused his team to lose the 1926 world series	agent_1 likes sports. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'hobby', 'holiday'].
5089	agent_1:Hi, how are you doing this evening? agent_2:Hi I'm doing well. Do you like baseball? I personally think it's really boring haha agent_1:Baseball is a slow game. I usually pay attention around the time of the playoffs. Then there's a lot of energy. agent_2:Yeah it gets burst of energy, and then a lot of really boring Parts LOL. I never knew that baseball managers could actually play for their team. That's why they wear uniforms, duh agent_1:Yeah, it's easier to just watch the highlight reel. The managers probably played way back in the day. Now? It would be sad. I'd want my money back. agent_2:Haha yep they would probably get injured really quickly LOL have you ever played kickball when you were a kid agent_1:I played kickball. Safer than dodgeball, that's for sure. agent_2:Yep I agree with you there. In Canada they call kickball soccer-baseball instead, it doesn't quite have the same ring LOL agent_1:It sure doesn't. That's clunky name. Baseball is so popular in Japan that many fans are surprised to discover it's  america's national pastime. I wonder why? The sport started here. agent_2:I agree with you. It's very screwy that they would not realize that LOL oh, did you hear about the man who found millions of dollars of baseball cards and his grandfather's attic? Now that is living the dream haha agent_1:That would be great! I would sell some of them, but keep some for a long-term investment. You never know how much they could be worth one day. agent_2:No you're right. That's why I don't throw anything away. And it's also why my house is a mess LOL. One thing I don't understand is why the MLB used a married couple for 24 years to schedule all their games, why wouldn't they use a computer agent_1:The couple probably used some kind of technology, but I bet they had a friend at the MLB head office. Maybe they were inexpensive? I dunno. agent_2:haha ya, and they did that until 2005, very crazy! agent_1:That's a long time. Do you watch the World Series? I try to. agent_2:No I can't say that I do haha. I like I said I don't really watch sports that much. I know that it is the best-of-seven games correct? Who do you want to win this year agent_1:I like it when an underdog wins. I'm tired of big city teams with big payrolls winning. The Series should bring out the best in the fans and the players.  agent_2:Yep I like that too. What's crazy is that Babe Ruth tried to steal a base in game seven. That's what made him lose the 1926 World Series. Wasn't Babe Ruth really fat? agent_1:He was pretty big later on, but he was also a pitcher at one time, so maybe he was speedy. Still, stealing a base? He was a hitter, not a runner. agent_2:Yep I agree with you. Pretty cool that the Cubs were the first team to win back-to-back World Series. I know that would be impressive	agent_1:It was impressive, but then they hit the world's longest losing streak. How? Is it a curse?	agent_2 likes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'World Series', 'famous people'].

11825	"agent_1:Hi, how are you doing this evening? agent_2:Great.  Did you know Ugg Boots were invented by surfers to keep their feet warm? agent_1:Surprised to hear that. I wonder how the surfer would fare with 5,000 year old shoes.  agent_2:They would probably make them into sandals and put dry tea bags in them to remove the smell.  agent_1:Ah, yes, but what kind of tea? Free-range organic tea? NFL player Steve Smith leaves his cleats on the field after every game. He hopes to raise awareness of homeless people without shoes. I bet he doesn't put tea in his shoes. agent_2:I bet they get stolen.  So many of these rich football people and their ""caring.""  The need to put their money where their mouth is like Norway.  They gave $1B to save Amazon rain forests.  agent_1: I wish the US gov’t would do something like that.The US gov’t owns 86% of the land in Nevada. I want to know what secret activities they’re engaged in there. Have that many aliens landed in Nevada? Is that their refueling station? agent_2:Most of that is BLM land leased to ranchers.  That other 14% must be Vegas.  agent_1:A man in France pretended to be a government official, and sold the Eiffel Tower not once, but twice. Maybe he could sell the land in Nevada for the US government and then the proceeds could go to the Amazon. agent_2:Sounds like a plan... He could get in the business of selling used ballet shoes.  They can go through 4 pairs a week. agent_1:Four pairs. I wonder how they would do with the 5000 year old shoes though. agent_2:Their toes much suffer too.  Maybe there should be ballet boots.  If they fall, they can pull themselves up by their bootstraps.  agent_1:Maybe Stephon Marbury could make an inexpensive line of pointe shoes. agent_2:Another great idea... Or use the boots that the turkey movers do in Norfolk. agent_1:Turkey mover? Is that a profession? agent_2:Yeah, farmers used to walk turkeys from Norfolk to London in the 18th century.  agent_1:That sounds like a pleasant excursion. Giant squawking birds for miles on end.  agent_2:Yeah, it only marginally beats out starvation or selling the Eiffel Tower.  agent_1:Well, hey man, I had a groovy time chatting with you this evening. I hope that you find the shoes that suit you, whatever you choose to do. (turkey mover) agent_2:Same here -- nice chat.  I sure won't be ballet...  agent_1:Hey, don't sell yourself short!

Amazon owns IMDB too, that's surprising. agent_2:I don't know what it is called, I want to check it out lol. I don't mind getting an even bigger discount on amazon goods. I wonder why the own imdb agent_1:Yah, it's just out of box stuff usually. Did you know there are no snakes in New Zealand? agent_2:New Zealand sounds like the place to be, snakes scare me lol. I don't get why some snakes give birth and some lay eggs agent_1:Yah, they're pretty messed up, it is interesting to know that the fear of snakes is engrained in our brains. agent_2:snakes are crazy lol agent_1:Truly, very crazy. I'm surprised Crocodiles are more closely related to bird than snakes and lizards. agent_2:I would never have guessed that. I wonder what the relationship is agent_1:Not really sure, maybe closer to dinosaurs? agent_2:Yea I think that is it, they say dinosaurs had feathers like birds lol, that would be interesting to see for sure!	agent_1:For sure, it was great chatting with you.

8020	agent_1:Hi do you like cats? They are definitely good at hunting vermin! agent_2:Agreed. I do love cats as well as most pets! Did you know the cat used in the opening scene of The Godfather was actually a stray they found on set? I thought that was pretty cool! agent_1:Oh that is super cool. From rags to riches. A cats life must be nice. They spend over half their life sleeping! agent_2:That us true. Ha! I would like to visit one of those cat cafes over in Japan that lets you pay by the hour to drink and play with cats! I bet that's so interesting! agent_1:That would be fun! Also there is a town in Alaska that has a cat mayor! agent_2:Is that so? That's a little odd! Ha! Did you ever hear about the physicist that published his cat as coauthor so he could avoid criticism by writing in first person plural? agent_1:Haha I never knew about that. However I also like dogs too. They were the first species to be domesticated! agent_2:I love dogs as well! It's crazy only dogs and elephants are the only animals that can understand pointing, isn't it? agent_1:Yeah I agree I would think more animals would understand that. Google also prefers dogs to cats which is kind of funny that they declare such a thing. agent_2:I know, right? I wonder if they have vending machines around their buildings that releases water and food in exchange for bottles like Istanbul does. It'd be nice if our country could do that! 	agent_1:Yeah probably not a ton of strays in Palo Alto!

13016	agent_1:Do you like Fish?  agent_2:I love fish, I like eating them and seeing them, you? agent_1:Me too. Did you know that the seahorse is the only fish to have a neck?  agent_2:That is so interesting, I did not know that, but makes sense. I don't know if you like jelly fish or not but there is one that is immortal agent_1:Yeah, I've heard that. I'm not sure how that is possible.  agent_2:Right, what if you blend it or do other things to it, it just won't die? agent_1:I'm not sure. It will probably die. I think it is a lie.  agent_2:I think so too lol. I wouldn't mess with the black swallower fish though, it can eat prey twice its length agent_1:Yeah, can it eat a human though?  agent_2:I doubt it lol, but I never want to find out either! It can eat 10x its weight so who knows agent_1:Ever listen to jazz?  agent_2:I love jazz music, it has been around so long, how about you agent_1:I do. Apparently so does Clint Eastwood. He is a lifelong Jazz enthusiast.  agent_2:That makes sense, it seems that at the end of most of his movies has jazz playing. I wonder if his new movie will have the same agent_1:I'm not sure. Interesting because today is Fat Tuesday. I just realized that.  agent_2:wow I did now that either! That gives me an excuse to pig out and listen to jazz! I wonder if pakistan will celebrate, they have some good jazz bands there also agent_1:I heard that too. Apparently the trumpeters grow goatees to provide comfort when playing.  agent_2:Nice, that gives me an excuse to grow one. I will tell my wife I will be playing jazz and it is required!	agent_1:Hilarious!

7853	agent_1:Hey do you like baseball by the way? What do you think about the Nationals agent_2:I'm a big baseball fan!  I think they will do ok even though they lost Bryce Harper.  It's kind of the same situation like how they lost Jayson Werth a few years ago. agent_1:Speaking of baseball did you know that a baseball manager can actually play for the team if necessary? agent_2:That would be interesting to see!  That's one rule I didn't know. agent_1:Yep that's why they wear uniforms, also weird is that in Canada people is known as soccer baseball agent_2:That's interesting too!  Up until 2005 a married couple scheduled all 2430 MLB games for 24 years. agent_1:That seems like a lot of work! Do you know why they stopped? The guy who found millions of dollars of baseball cards in his attic is a very lucky dude!	agent_2:I don't know why they stopped.  I know I would stop working if I found a million dollars worth of baseball cards!  lol	agent_1 dislikes hobby. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobby', 'sports', 'longest-married-couple'].

Have you been to many concerts? agent_2:i used to go to concerts when i was younger. dont have the time or money now. LOL You? agent_1:Haha same here! What's your favorite one that you remember? agent_2:I saw Rush a couple of times. that was great. they were so good live. agent_1:I bet! Can you believe Linkin Park did 324 concerts in 2001 alone? agent_2:I cant imagine having that much energy. they must have slept on the bus. how could they do that? agent_1:Pure adrenaline probably haha. They could have been like the Ramones touring for 20 straight years. I wonder how many concerts they put on? agent_2:Probably over 100 a year, so about 2000?  agent_1:It looks like 2263 in total! You were close! At least they weren't as bas a Creed doing concerts lol.	agent_2:Is Creed a christian rock band? it sounds religious.	agent_1 likes music. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'greeting', 'greeting'].
1802	agent_2:I have heard that. Hendrix set his guitar on fire at Woodstock. agent_1:That just shows how badass they are, haha! The best guitarists are the ones that set stuff on fire from playing... or have a phd in astrophysics like the one from Queen. agent_2:Yes. He is a smart guy. agent_1:Do you know how to play the guitar?  agent_2:No. I wish that I did agent_1:Same here. Whenever i watch people, it looks so easy to pick up and learn... until you actually try to learn and realize its alot harder than it looks hah. Taking the time to build up muscles in your fingers is hard work. agent_2:Its a great musical instrument agent_1:This is true. That statement also goes well with piano's. There's so many talented artists out there that can play the piano and guitar. Did you know that Freddie Mercury used the same piano to record Bohemian rhapsody as paul mccartney used to record hey jude? That must be a super lucky piano. agent_2:Yes. That piano must be worth a bit of money agent_1:I could only imagine. I wonder where they keep that piano.  agent_2:it should be in the rock and roll hall of fame agent_1:As it should be. It would be so awesome to see it in person.  agent_2:A long time ago at the fillmore east I saw grand funk railroad. Talk about loud and sparks flying agent_1:Oh nice! I haven't heard of that band until now. What is some popular songs that they have? I want to look them up and give them a listen.	agent_2:Were an American band, Im your Captain, Some kind of wonderful, are some hits they had in the 1970s	agent_1 likes music. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'musician', 'Freddie Mercury'].
10506	agent_1:Its crazy how Google and Amazon have grown agent_2:It's hard to even believe Google has been around for over twenty years. agent_1:I know right, seems like its been around forever agent_2:And Amazon has been around even longer, since 1994. agent_1:Its a long time, Amazon started as an online bookstore right? agent_2:Yes, but now it's largest Internet retailer in the world! agent_1:It is, it sells everything from books to groceries to pet supplies you name it, I love the company	agent_2:It also sells low-end and affordable products under its own brand called AmazonBasics.	agent_1 likes product. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['product', 'technology', 'Amazon'].

12902	agent_1:Good morning.  So, the other day I was shopping for a shirt and then I heard that originally shirts used to be an item worn exclusively by men.  How strange. agent_2:Maybe because women only wore dresses? agent_1:Maybe, that would make sense.  In America we will call most anything a shirt, but in British English it is specifically what we would refer to as a dress shirt.  That could be confusing if you are visiting another country. agent_2:Oh, so that is probably what they meant-women did not used to wear dress shirts. agent_1:Maybe.  I am glad I don't work somewhere I have to wear dress shirts or button up shirts.  There are also button down shirts, which is where the collar also has buttons. agent_2:If you're in Hawaii, the official business attire is the aloha shirt. That seems fun. agent_1:Which is why I love Hawaii so much.  Aloha shirts are great.   agent_2:In China gangs used to layer on as many shirts as possible. That seems, um, uncomfortable. agent_1:Yeah, and they used to pop the collars.  I remember when popping your polo shirt collar was a fashion around here.	agent_2:It's interesting that polo shirts were invented for one specific tennis player.	agent_1 likes hobby. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobby', 'fashion', 'aloha shirt'].
13899	agent_1:Do you like sharks?  agent_2:I think they're one of the most interesting animals on the planet plus I enjoy watching Shark Week, how about you? agent_1:I rarely watch it. But it seems like a cool show, what channel is it on?  agent_2:It's on Discovery Channel. It's a yearly event they have with all different sorts of shows that they air. agent_1:I don't think I have that channel. Did you know sharks rescue sailors?  agent_2:I never knew that, I only thought it was dolphins that did that. That is an interesting behavior for a predator. agent_1:It sort of sounds not real to me.  agent_2:Yeah I kind of have a hard time believing it as well. I like watching some of the crazy movies they have made about sharks like The Meg or Sharknado as well. agent_1:Did you know sharks can be trained like dogs to bark?  agent_2:I did not know that. That's another shark fact that I have some skepticism about! agent_1:Yeah, I have a lot of them to be honest. Apparently they also evolved earlier than dinosaurs.  agent_2:That one I can believe, they have been around is some form for a long time. The Megaladon was a huge ancient shark. They think the Great White caused it's extinction because they were smaller and able to get to prey better. agent_1:What about dogs, are you a fan of dogs?  agent_2:I am a big dog person, I have one of my own. I'm allergic to cats so they were never really an option for me. agent_1:I'm allergic to cat hair too! agent_2:Do you have any pets of your own? agent_1:Nah, that is too much of a hassle. Did you know that google prefers dogs to cats? 	agent_2:I think dogs are the more social animal so it makes sense for a company to have a dog policy over a cat policy. I know of a few people who have therapy dogs that go to hospitals or even to libraries so that children with reading problems can read out loud to them without feeling embarrassed.	agent_1 likes work. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['work', 'pets', 'sports'].
1686	agent_1:Good Morning! Do you like to watch horror films? agent_2:Hi, how are you? I am not really a fan of the genre, though I have some favorites. agent_1:What are some of your favorite ones? Stephen king considers Bambi one haha. agent_2:King was just a kid, to be fair. That movie could be scary to a tiny child. He then turned his fright into a profession. agent_1:You're right on that one. Did you know you can burn 180 calories watching one? agent_2:I suppose that I could try to lose weight that way. It might be easier to exercise. I like a couple of films, but after the first viewing, they are not as scary. agent_1:Just do a marathon one day of watching them and you'll be set. Have you seen the Shining? The boy actor didn't even know it was a horror film until years later. agent_2:I liked the Shining. King wrote a great story and it translated well to the screen. I am surprised by the kid though. What did he think it was? agent_1:That is a good question. You would think watching the cinematography alone would let you know it was one! agent_2:I wonder if he ever saw the film while he was a kid. I think maybe his parents wouldn't let him.  agent_1:That could be it! Did you know no woman has ever been nominated for best cinematography at the oscars? agent_2:That is a shame. I don't know how many women cinematographers there are, but probably not enough. There should be more. agent_1:I agree with you! Especially with the box office at what it is. I would hate to work for the movie Trojan Wars. They made only 309 dollars on a budget of 15 million! agent_2:Movies are such a crapshoot. There is no magic formula for success. Stars, special FX, marketing. Doesn't matter. agent_1:They really are, even with the big names. Tom Hanks has earned 8.5 billion in film earnings for his movies. agent_2:He is a bankable star. People love him. But he also works with certain people regularly. Spielberg. Zemeckis. They are capable directors. agent_1:Oh for sure! Have you seen Disney's Treasure Planet? That was one of the most expensive box office flops ever. agent_2:I did not. Was that animated? Usually animated stuff is pretty good. I'm surprised.	agent_1:I am surprised too, especially with the Disney name attached to it!	agent_2 likes movie. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'movie', 'yes'].

I apologize I have just read some distressing material about skin heads.  Did you know skin heads opposed antifa activists? agent_2:No problem. Just a strong first sentence. I did not know that. What is the antifa? agent_1:I am not exactly sure what Antifa is either. agent_2:Just looked it up and it is a left wing autonomous militant group agent_1:Ah I see seems natural they would oppose them. agent_2:Agreed.

I know I would stop working if I found a million dollars worth of baseball cards!  lol agent_1:Yep I could think of a lot of things to do with a million dollars lOL and I would be very happy that my grandfather had them in the Attic agent_2:Yes!  No doubt.  Did you know that the womens world cup had a higher tv ratings than the world series in the US? agent_1:No I didn't know that that's crazy. also crazy is that baseball is super popular in Japan, they even think that it is their National Pastime and not ours LOL agent_2:lol  Babe Ruth who was known for home runs was caught stealing to end game 7 of the 1926 world series?  Interesting useless stat.  lol agent_1:Haha what's an interesting stat. Do you ever watch Game of Thrones? I know that's a change of topic agent_2:I've seen it but don't follow it close.  I know it got financed by Ireland because they film scenes there which boosts tourism incomes. agent_1:Yep you're right about that. I think it first premiered back in 2011 which seems like a long time ago, I can't wait for the new season to start in April agent_2:The next season is supposed to be the last one correct? agent_1:Yes it will be the last one. It's crazy that Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter is actually in Game of Thrones, I forget who she is though agent_2:Wow.  I never knew that.  How neat.  I'm going to have to binge watch it and get caught up before the last season begins.  I've heard that Arya is the fastest rising new baby name given to girls in the US most like because of Game of Thrones. agent_1:Haha you're right about that! And yes you should definitely check it out, they even made a knockoff series about lions called game of lions LOL agent_2:That's funny!  I see that Harry Lloyd who is on there is the great great great grandson of Charles Dickens.  That is neat they have 2 people related to famous people from a long time ago.	agent_1:Yep I agree with you.

3768	agent_1:Hi, how are you? agent_2:Good. I learned a few fun facts. Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer as well as kung fu star and won the Hong Kong Cha-Cha championship in 1958. agent_1:That's cool,never would have pictured him doing the Cha Cha but it takes the same skills probably to perform Kung Fu. agent_2:Other stars you would not expect, Tupac danced ballet and was the Mouse King in his high school production of the Nutcracker. agent_1:Wow, Tupac?  You must be pulling my leg!  Never could he be a ballet dancer.  Wow! agent_2:I know but creative people are drawn to the arts. Just like how babies are drawn to music. They will spontaneously dance when they hear music and smile when they hit the beat. agent_1:Speaking of ballet, did you know that ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week? agent_2:That is a lot of shoes. They must need it for all the extreme moves they perform. Kind of like Michael Jackson's extreme lean that he has a patent on. agent_1:You're probably right! agent_2:Some birds are so beautiful it is almost like they are dancing in flight. Hummingbirds are some of my favorites. Did you know they steal spiderwebs to build their nests? agent_1:Yes, birds are amazing.  Their bones are so hollow the fearthers weigh more than their skeletons. agent_2:That is fascinating. Some birds migrate from Alaska to Mexico without sleeping! agent_1:I wouldn't make a good bird!  Couldn't do that, at all. agent_2:Me either. I sometimes worry I would be like a dodo bird. They are in a sub-family of pigeon. agent_1:Lol, didn't know that!  I read some wild Australian birds can mimic sounds like chainsaws and car alarms! agent_2:I find birds fascinating. They evolved wings and yet some lost the ability to fly like penguins. And then there are others that lived near water that became great at swimming. agent_1:If I was a bird, I hope I would have enough smarts to evolve to thrive in my environment.  Our poor birds today are struggling.  I've watched Canadian Geese all winter try to figure out when to head back North, only to hit a blizzard and have to turn around and fly back South.  It's sad.	agent_2:It is sad. They are such a great indicator species of our environment.

7445	agent_1: Hello,  did you know that more than 80% of the earths forests have been destroyed? agent_2:That is sad. I hope we can reverse that  statistic.  agent_1:Yeah that is really sad.  I recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century.  agent_2:I also think it is interesting that when earth was formed, a day was only 5.5 hours long. I wonder why that changed? agent_1:I don't know,  maybe it slowed its rotation eventually?  That's pretty weird.   agent_2:Do you believe in aliens? The UN appointed ambassadors to extraterrestrials.  agent_1:Yes,  definitely.  Thats cool lol at least they are prepared!  Do you believe in aliens? agent_2:I am not sure. I feel like there is more life out there. I wonder if they will make contact with earth? agent_1:Im assuming so,  otherwise what would the ambassador have to study?  lol how else can he be prepared if theres no evidence? agent_2:I am not sure. Do you have any pets?  agent_1:Yup,  I have a dog.  How about you? agent_2:I have a cat. Did you know that there are cat cafes in japan and taiwan where people can pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks! agent_1:lol yeah,  theres all sorts of cafes like that,  Ive been to a meerkat cafe,  a bird cafe and a raccoon cafe before.  agent_2:That is really interesting. I would like that. I wish i slept as much as cats. When a cat reaches 15 years old it has usually spent 10 years of its life sleeping. agent_1:Thats a lot of sleeping!

1279	"agent_1:There was man who was falsely imprisoned. He used the prison library to study law and learn to free himself. That is amazing don't you think? agent_2:That is awesome! Speaking of libraries, there are more libraries than McDonalds in the United States. Do you have a library card? agent_1:I do and that is good to hear. Also, half of adult have library cards that seems like more than I would have thought. agent_2:I know. I don't know that a lot of my friends go to the library. The Sacramento Library has instituted a type of library that might make going to the library more interesting to many. They started a library of things, so you can check out sewing machines and other things that you don't need to own for a long time. agent_1:That would be so useful. I wonder if other cities do that? I know that normal library collections often included DVD's and CD's and other things besides books. agent_2:Yes, and I have also checked out passes to various museums in my city. I'm glad some people were dedicated to starting libraries in the past as they have been so useful to me. Have you heard of UK Prime Minister William Gladstone? agent_1:I have. I heard that he started a library in 1895 with 32,000 books in it. All from his personal collection. Can you imagine? agent_2:The more amazing thing to me is how he carted all those books by wheelbarrow over 3/4 mile. He was 85! agent_1:Maybe his daughter helped him. I wonder how many were Shakespeare plays. I was reading one at the library. Did you know that Shakespear coined many of the terms we use today, including ""good riddance"" and ""laughing stock?"" agent_2:Oh, that's interesting. I would never have thought as luck would have it, break the ice, and full circle were from Shakespeare. agent_1:I guess it makes sense that he coined so many terms since he was the world's greatest dramatist. Plus, he wrote so much. He wrote 39 plays! agent_2:Not only did he coin terms, but he created names. The names Miranda, Olivia and Jessica were invented by Shakespeare. I didn't know those names went so far back! agent_1:That is interesting. I wonder if these names sound different with the accent of the time. I know the accent can affect the meaning of the performance. The old accent can introduce rhymes or puns that don't work with our modern tongue. What might Miranda sound like in Shakespeare's voice? agent_2:That is an interesting thought. Shakespeare has been translated into every major language. I wonder how they preserve Shakespeare's style and language in other languages. agent_1:That is a good question. It would be interesting to study that in school. I bet people use to study Shakespeare in school more than they do now. I hear that people often studied the Bible in school before 1963. agent_2:Yes, the Bible does still play a large role in our lives though. Presidents are still sworn in with them. I wonder why Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams did not use Bibles at their swearing in ceremonies. agent_1:That is true. It does play a role still. Plus it was influenced by real history. For example, the tower of Babel was probably based on a real building in what is now Iraq. agent_2:Thomas Jefferson didn't seem to agree with all parts of the Bible. He made his own version and cut out the supernatural parts. I wonder why that was. agent_1:Interesting!. All so at least three Presidents saw the Bible differently (Jefferson, Roosevelt and Adams.) Iti is interesting to think about how the Bible changes too. For example, the apple from Adam and Eve was a translation from the 4th century."	agent_2:That's true.

I would totally agree. Planning backwards are what some experts say to do, like Susan Gage Caterers. agent_1:haha, true! Another of my all time fav things to do would be dance! although my back doesnt like it so much. I love watching dance videos... agent_2:Oh yeah, me too!Dancing while I bake pies for Thanksgiving is an exacta. I have a guilty pleasure of dancing to ballet musicals. I read that those ballerinas go through four pairs of pointe shoes per week.! agent_1:That is a daily, cooking and dancing! and ouch! 4 pairs! Oh my word, that beats my once every year. Another great dance was Michael Jackson, he had a patent on a device, I didnt know you could achieve lean in dance moves agent_2:Really, that is a cool fact. I liked his music even though the person is in question."	agent_1:True, its hard to know truth from lies in the media unfortunately, Bruce lee was also a great dancer he even won the hong kong cha-cha championship in 1958!

It is the only object known to have life and we need to know why that is. agent_1:I agree, we must find life in other planets if we want to survive as a species, its sad how 80% of the forests have been destroyed by now agent_2:That is definitely sad and very troubling.  It makes me wonder what will happen to the polar regions with all of the ice. agent_1:Global Warming happened to them and if we dont start caring about our planet we might need to find another one soon. agent_2:Already things are changing.  Did you know that there will be no helium on the planet by the end of this century?  Not only are we losing plants and animals but now we are losing elements. agent_1:I did not know that, I wonder how that will affect us, im sure it will have hidden consequences on life on earth and to think we account to only a small portion of earths history agent_2:I imagine it will have consequences too.  I've heard that when the earth was first formed a day was only just over 5 hours long.  That would be weird.  I guess that means the planet used to be closer to the sun? agent_1:Yeah, it seems that way, or maybe rotated at a bigger speed, you know we  have an embassador in case aliens arrive to the planet or try to make contact with us. agent_2:I didn't know that!  That's actually pretty cool!  I hope he or she is friends with Elon Musk. At the rate he is going, he'll find life before the government does.  He's already planning a colony on Mars. agent_1:Elon Musk is a genious, hopefully he is successful with his colonisation plan, he is also an actor you know agent_2:I didn't know that.  I knew he co founded paypal but I had no idea he acted as well. agent_1:Yeah apparently he acted in a thank you for smoking sketch, and his wife is an actress as well she was in the movie Inception agent_2:Impressive.  I like that he is into solar energy.  He inspired a solar company and now it's part of Tesla. agent_1:He is looking into the future that is for sure, he also wanted to build a vertical take off jet for passangers. agent_2:That would be different. I wonder if it would have benefits that the normal way doesn't.  You know he thinks outside the box.  When he wants to do something he just does it, like shooting a cheese wheel into space. agent_1:That is an absurd way to waste money lol, shooting a cheese wheel into space! amazing but at the same time wasteful. agent_2:If you got it why not?  He is worth over 20 billion dollars after all. agent_1:Yeah I guess so, just seems like a waste with all the poor families and kids without homes in the world, to think Musk was born in 1971, he sure has taken advantage of his time on earth agent_2:He really has.  I think he can be inspiring.  I can see how it could be wasteful to spend money like that but on the other hand he shows people to just do what they want with what they have.  It's a lot like Galileo back in the day building a telescope.  To me it's a way to say give your imagination free reign and try stuff.  Tesla is an electronic car company that he founded in the day and age where the big automakers dominate but he is giving it a try.	agent_1:Yeah I guess his contributions to socitety are bigger, one day he will be remembered as Galileo and other historic figures.	agent_2 likes history. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['history', 'environment', 'climate change'].

I dont see it as the supreme achievement in comedy like he does though. agent_2:I was going to ask what you thought about it.  Jack Black was going to star in the Green Lantern which was originally supposed to be a comedy.   agent_1:I think it would have been better as a comedy. I like Jack Black movies. agent_2:I love them!  He cracks me up.  I like corny goofball comedy.  I used to like watching 3rd Rock from the Sun when it was on tv for that same reason. agent_1:Yeah I liked the goofy brother. Dont remember his name. I thought he was funny.	agent_2:Yes.  I can picture his face, but can't remember his name either.

13378	agent_1:Hi do you know many facts about the Earth?  agent_2:I know some facts. For instance you could fit all the plants in the solar system between the Earth and the Moon.! agent_1:Wow!  I know that it's the third planet from the sun. agent_2:Yes, that's where the show 3rd Rock from the Sun got it's name! agent_1:Yes!  Earth was formed over 4.5 billion years ago! agent_2:It's crazy to think how old the universe is and how little humans have been around in comparison! agent_1:I agree!  The moon is the only natural satellite of the Earth! agent_2:It would be interesting to see what the sky would look like if we had more than one moon! agent_1:That would be kind of weird after seeing just the moon my whole life.  About 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered in water. agent_2:I think that the deep ocean is just as interesting as space, there is so much we haven't discovered there as well!	agent_1:I agree there.  That's the next frontier.

9617	agent_1:Hi, how are you? What do you think of this planet of ours? agent_2:Hello, Great! Its very interesting!! Its upsetting about our natural forests being destroyed! agent_1:Ithink that we will destroy them all within the next 100 years. We cannot slow down. We want more and more agent_2:Could be, very sad! I hope not though. agent_1:Soon we will run out of helium. Earth will be virtually helium-free by the end of the 21st century. Where will it all go? agent_2:I know, where? Interesting when the earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long! agent_1:Now it's longer and getting even longer. Soon the workday will be 20 hours. I will retire then. agent_2:lol, good idea!! We have a time change on the 10th of March! agent_1:I totally forgot. I guess that I will lose an hour of sleep. Doh.  agent_2:Yeah, spring forward.  Do you like superhero's like Wonder woman? agent_1:I like Wonder Woman. I did not see the recent film. I heard it was good. agent_2:I didn't either, Gal Gadot was unaware she was auditioning for wonder woman, she thought it was for cat woman!	agent_1:That's great! She looks like Wonder Woman.

7172	agent_1:Hi! Are you familiar with Bad Times at the El Royale? I feel it basically defies expectations even though not all of its surprises are pleasant but there is satisfaction, however! agent_2:hi how are you? I have heard of it. it is a movie that came out recently, right? agent_1:Not too long ago and it's basically set in 1969 and is also kind of a B movie, black comedy and mystery! Drew Goddard directed it as well! agent_2:A B movie? Great! that sounds fun. low budget? doesnt take itself too seriously? agent_1:Exactly. So are you a horror fan in general? I watch horror films as a workout because you can burn over 180 calories just by watching them, surprisingly enough! agent_2:I thnk the first time it would burn that many, but the second time maybe not. not so scary.  agent_1:That is a good point. But you know what else is crazy, they say if you view abstract art after watching a horror film, you'll enjoy it a lot more! I need to try that! agent_2:How does that even work? is your brain more active? more emotionally sensitive? agent_1:I would imagine so. It's so weird, isn't it? I tell you what else is weird, Stephen King once said Bambi was the first horror movie he watched. Can you believe that? He definitely has a twisted mind, doesn't he? agent_2:He probably was traumatized by that disney flick and ended up fascinated with the macabre. agent_1:Agreed! You know what else gets me? Danny from The Shining didn't actually know he was acting in a horror movie until years later. It's like how did he not know? agent_2:I guess he was ....slow? i dont know. what kind of movie did he imagine it to be? agent_1:That's what I'm wondering. Ha! But enough of this horror talk, or else I'm going to get scared. Ha! Are you a fantasy fan at all? I'd like to join the national spelling bee fantasy draft one of these days! agent_2:I have never down fantasy sports. I guess the appeal is that you compete and can make some money?	agent_1:I guess so! But I also think it's cool that a single fold in our brains basically separate how we perceive reality and fantasy. That's truly amazing!	agent_2 likes hobbies. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobbies', 'movie', 'movie'].

Is it true about their rail system not being there? agent_2:I think it is! I heard without cars, they use domestic flights to travel. agent_1:That is interesting, it certainly helps people getting over their fear of flying lol. I wonder if it is because of the terrain agent_2:I am not sure. But I do know it is very cheap to travel. agent_1:That is awesome, at least they make it cheap.

I've had cockatiels, parakeets, and some fancier parrots when I was a kid. Did you know the famously extinct Dodo bird, is closely related to the pigeon? agent_2:That is awesome, so you are quite the bird expert.  I didn't know that, very interesting though.   agent_1:Haha! I know a few fun facts about birds. Such as in most birds the bones are so hollow that the feathers weigh more than the entire skeleton!  agent_2:That is awesome, I guess it makes sense though when you figure they have to be able to stay airborne. 	agent_1:Apparently, humingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests.

Have you ever been? agent_2:No I have not. I will be traveling to Portland this year so I may have to see these Oregon vineyards firsthand now.	agent_1:Nice. My sister loves a vineyard in Oregon.

Do you have any hobbies? agent_1:Funny you mention it i use to write a little poetry. how about you? agent_2:I used to do a little poetry in high school, learning about allusions, symbolism, and all the other poetry jargon.  agent_1:Wow that's taking me back. Poetry dates back to prehistoric times. agent_2:Poetry was first written by the Greeks I believe. Perhaps earlier, but I don't think we have any other ancient written works dating prior agent_1:The earliest western poetry was written in Sumerian.  agent_2:Was it as complex then as today? Using rhyme, rhetoric, and other literary devices? agent_1:One was called the Epic of Sundiata an example of griot court poetry. This was in Africa.  agent_2:Writing poetry is definitely an art. For instance, there is poem that when read normally is depressing, yet backwards it is inspiring. Perhaps embodying the silver lining to a negative situation. agent_1:Wow i would like to read that one. There is an alphabet that when recited in order forms a poem. I for get which one.	agent_2:To this day poetry influenced our perceptions.

And that's a great question haha do you know who Helena Bonham Carter is? agent_2:yeah, she was in Fight Club, other than that I don't remember many of the movies with her.  agent_1:Apparently she's related to the prime minister of the United Kingdom during World War I. That's very bizarre agent_2:Really? That is pretty weird. Did you know if you hit 100 in japan they give you a silver cup?  agent_1:I did not know that. It's funny that so many people turned 100 they had to find a way to make cheaper cups though haha agent_2:Hilarious, at least they are healthy there. 	agent_1:That's true they're definitely not giving those Awards away in the United States haha.

Hard to believe amazon workers walk between 7 and 15 miles each day. agent_1:Yeah I use it quite a bit myself, and it is hard to believe, I would think no more than 2 or 3.  agent_2:Yea that seems more accurate. Also I was interested to know IMDB is owned by Amazon.  agent_1:Yeah I didn't know that about them, I wonder how many other things they own? agent_2:Yeah good question. I respect Bezos though. He built the largest internet retailer in the world all the way back in 1994. agent_1:Yeah Bezos is a great businessman.  Did you know he built a clock into a mountain that will run for 10,000 years? agent_2:Whoa I would like to see that. The Amazon contract with USPS must explain how they are able to deliver packages so fast, even on Sundays! agent_1:Yeah I wonder how the postal employees felt when they learned that Sundays are no longer off days for all.  agent_2:Yeah I bet that didn't go over so well. But only a matter of time until Artificial Intelligence will start delivering for Amazon. There is even a non profit organization for the advancement of AI. agent_1:I think I read that, I wonder who funds that kind of organization? agent_2:Yeah good question I'm not sure. AI is definitely good at solving puzzles though as it crushed all human records in the puzzle game ""2048"".  agent_1:That is pretty impressive, did you know the actress Kristen Stewart once co-authored a paper on AI? agent_2:I didn't take that actress for the scientific type. I would like to attend one of Stanford's free AI classes. agent_1:Yeah same here, I think that would be very interesting to sit in on a class or two.  agent_2:Very much so! I just hope machines don't become so capable that they start to perform things without commands! agent_1:Yeah and that is where it starts to get scary, especially if we give them a lot of control.  agent_2:Yeah. There has to be a fine line between helping us out but not taking over. I would think that google would make a good AI. Google once used hundreds of goats to trim it's lawns instead of making people do it. agent_1:I read that before, that is so crazy!  I wonder what other people that didn't work there think of them.  agent_2:Yeah I bet they think positively of them.

Google once hired goats to mow the lawn instead of people agent_2:That is so cool and different and also more environmentally friendly.  agent_1:True.

In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman God of War and is often referred to as the Red Planet. agent_2:I would say that Mars is a fierce looking neighbor, but probably the friendliest planet at least for humans. Second to earth, that is. agent_1:Yes, I agree, it's reddish iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. agent_2:I think the red is clear from a distance, but up close, it's not quite so red. Plus I bet the atmosphere changes the appearance of a lot of things. And sound, too. agent_1:Well, Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere having surfaces like the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. agent_2:Mars has an atmosphere, but it makes the sunsets blue, I believe. Not really breathable.  agent_1:Yes, due to the differences in atmosphere, sounds on Mars have a higher pitch than they do on Earth. agent_2:That would make us sound funny! Like helium balloons do. Still, I would rather live my life on Earth. I know that with fast travel, we could get to Mars fast. But what would you do there? agent_1:If you change your mind, a Mars colonization project is planned for 2023 and will be funded by creating a reality TV show.	agent_2:I would not want to be the first there.

I think that is how Trump does so well, people believe in the Deep State, and such. agent_1:I agree! What kind of music do you like to listen to? agent_2:I'm a kid of the eighties and nineties,  I never really moved on from that alternative rock scene. agent_1:Same here! I think rap has been a major significance in the last twenty years though huh? agent_2:There has been the odd rap song that I like, but for me it's cultural.  I'm just not from the environment most rappers are and can't appreciate their point of view. agent_1:I agree too! I can't believe a michigan judge once delivered her ruling to eminem in the form of a rap haha. agent_2:That's kind of cool, I like it when people don't take themselves too seriously.  Like when Kanye made fun of himself on SNL.  If only he'd do it more. agent_1:All he has to do is talk and it happens haha. I give him props though, he once gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair at a concert. However, I'm sure he told a person to stand up in a wheelchair before too..... agent_2:Funny.  Are you one for hats?  Probably not a MAGA hat, but hat's in general?  agent_1:I wear hats when I'm out hiking, but that is about it, how about you? agent_2:Generally not.  I'm originally from the UK so I guess most people would associate me with a bowler hat, but never really worn any type of hat. agent_1:It took me awhile to figure out what it looks like but now I know. Wasn't that the most popular hat in the old west too?	agent_2:I'm guessing that is because of TV and movies, we get this idea of the way it is shown when reality is somewhat different. Being self deprecating, I'd say a dunces cap suits me well.	agent_1 likes hobby. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobby', 'music', 'rapper'].

What about you? agent_2:i dont like snakes but i dont hate. they are to be respected. they are part of nature agent_1:There is a genus of flying snakes! Nope! agent_2:That would be a hard no for me too. dang nature why you so scary LOL Crocodiles are more closely related to birds than they are to snakes and lizards. i guess i could move to australia agent_1:Australia's got crazy too! I remember a story of huge birds dropping dead out of the sky. Or maybe they were bats. Anyways, huge flying things falling from the sky! agent_2:yeah, lots of scary things there. crocodiles are pretty scary, but they are not related snakes LOL agent_1:Humans are not the only ones afraid of snakes. Monekys are too! agent_2:monkeys are smart, they know what is dangerous! i bet a lot of creatures are afraid  of snakes. agent_1:I wonder if they can tell the difference between snakes and legless lizards.	agent_2:i bet they dont care. they fear anything that is close. i know i would! by the way, do you go to concerts much?	agent_1 likes music. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'news', 'pets'].

Did you know There is a programming language in which the programs are written in musical composition, and functional programs have jazz-like harmonies. agent_2:That's interesting. I guess there is a reason some jazz trumpeters have goatees. It provides comfort when playing. agent_1:hmmm didn't know that. Clint eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast, pianist, and scored several films, including million dollar baby agent_2:Speaking of celebrities, Pixar has a secret room that is often visited by celebrities. I wonder what is in it. agent_1:thats awesome! Robin williams in aladdin was the first actor to start the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films. agent_2:And apparently we even need celebrities in our kids tv shows. Carol Burnett was the first celebrity to appear in Sesame Street. agent_1:Thats interesting.  Judge judy makes $123,000 per episode, making her the highest paid celebrity only after lebron james. agent_2:Some celebrities try to do noble things with their fame. Ethiopia has a tv chef that thinks he can combat the country's hunger agent_1:Thats amazing!  agent_2:Speaking of celebrities wanting to do things for greater causes, did you know that the Beatles song ""come together"" was written for a campaign? agent_1:I did,  but I dont know which one.  agent_2:It was for Timothy Leary's 1969 California governor campaign. agent_1:Good to know! Ralph lawrence carr was the only governor to oppose the internment of japanese americans during ww2 agent_2:That is kind of depressing! agent_1:I know right. Texas elected their first female governor, the second in the nation, before some states even ratified the 19th amendment. agent_2:Well, that is kind of encouraging. Did you know that in 1934 North Dakota seceded from the US because North Dakota's governor declared martial law? agent_1:Interesting. When schwarzenegger was governor of california, he never lived in sacramento. instead he commuted 3 hours everyday... by private jet. agent_2:I wonder whose dime that was on. agent_1:Good question!  agent_2:That seems like a long time to have to travel each and every day though."	agent_1:yeah I know right.

Did you know Disney thought about shutting down their studio after Sleeping beauty flopped at the box office? agent_1:Yikes, was it that bad?  I have only seen it like once or twice lol.  Glad they didnt, they have come out with some really good stuff agent_2:I know right?  I loved it as a kid, I didn't think it was that bad.  You know I knew Silence of The Lambs made lots of money at the box office, but I didn't realize it came out on Valentine's day in 1991.

Did you know jazz originated in the African American communities of New Orleans in the late 19th and early 20 century. agent_2:i think I did know that.  Seems like I've seen a movie that referenced it.  Didn't they combine jazz with some brass band marches or something? agent_1:It has roots in blues and ragtime.  It is now recognized as a major form of musical expression. agent_2:I'm glad.  It's world wide now too.  Pakistan has a jazz orchestra!	agent_1:Cool jazz actually originated in the 1940s.

Watch a lot of games every year and can't wait until spring training... Babe ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 and lose the 1926 world series with his team down by one run. agent_2:Wow, that's awesome! Who is your favorite Baseball team? I like my Az team lol agent_1:Chicago Cubs. I'm from Chicago so... Love going to Wrigley! agent_2:O wow, that must be fantastic! I also like the Boston Red Sox, did you know the new york times has partial ownership? agent_1:I did. Baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if the need arises agent_2:Cool and smart! The Red Sox have won 9 world series games! agent_1:That's a lot! Up until 2005, a married couple, for 24 years, scheduled all 2430 major league baseball games played each year agent_2:Really! That is a lot, crazy! I didn't know that in Canada kickball is also called soccer-baseball, interesting! agent_1:A man found three million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic- hidden since the 1940s.  agent_2:Whoa, what a lucky find that was! Did you know the Chicago Cubs were the 1st to win back to back world series....but haven't won since....but I bet you know that! agent_1:I did. And they won in 2016 so that/s inaccurate. But it's not your fault... You've been great! agent_2:Ohh, haha sorry....So in 1992 world series the US Marine corps color guard carried the Canada flag into the stadium upside down! nuts! agent_1:WHAT?

In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman God of War and is often referred to as the Red Planet. agent_2:I would say that Mars is a fierce looking neighbor, but probably the friendliest planet at least for humans. Second to earth, that is. agent_1:Yes, I agree, it's reddish iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. agent_2:I think the red is clear from a distance, but up close, it's not quite so red. Plus I bet the atmosphere changes the appearance of a lot of things. And sound, too. agent_1:Well, Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere having surfaces like the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.	agent_2:Mars has an atmosphere, but it makes the sunsets blue, I believe.

I think it's funny they were intially called cathode ray tube amusement devices! agent_2:I know I am so glad we switched to just calling them video games agent_1:Yes so much easier. In South Korea it's illegal for kids 16 and under to play video games past midnight. I would have broken the law a lot if I grew up there! agent_2:Me too and I wonder how they can tell. Do you know who Stephen Fry is? agent_1:Isn't he that narrator who narrated little big planet, and some other games as well? I thought his name sounded familiar, I would probably recognize his voice.  agent_2:Yes he did that and the harry potter and hitchhiker's guide to galaxy, such a talent agent_1:Very cool.

Google really is taking over the world. Their data center electricity use is 0.01 percent of all worldwide electricity. agent_1:Yes for sure they are. they have grown so much over the years agent_2:But I like that they like to have fun too. Have you ever typed askew into Google? agent_1:No I have. What does the results turn?	agent_2:You should try it! It tilts the page. Another fun thing Google does is call new employees nogglers.

13287	agent_1:I built a toy robot once. Have you? agent_2:No, I'd probably electrocute myself if I tried, but it would be cool to have a pet robot agent_1:The company Anki is introducing a small table top companion.  Kind of like Alexa.  The think I built was programmed in basic.  This you talk to. agent_2:Yea, ANki wants a robot in every home, hopefully there is no ulterior motives agent_1:I am sure this thing will collect data while it rolls around the table top.  Kid does not like peas.  Must inform the high command.  The fur child has thrown up again.  Scary the information it will collect. agent_2:Sounds creepy to be honest, a palm sized robot that can crack jokes agent_1:Should a robot have expressive eyes?  I do not want to think of this little thing as feeling.  Remember Rosie from the Jetsons.  Thats what I want.  Smart, dangerous, useful. agent_2:Yea, Vector sounds creepy to me, nudging people's hands for attention agent_1:Honda's Asimo was pretty strange to watch.  It must have been costly. It was pointless as far as I know. agent_2:Yea, I wouldn't pay 1,000 for an Asimo agent_1:I think it cost far more than that.  Anki has a kickstarter to raise funds.  Looks like they will make the $500,000 goal.  Soon the robots will take over the world. agent_2:Maybe that is why Michael Jackson planned to build a 50 foot robot to protect mankind from other mini robots agent_1:Vector will cost $250.  You can buy a lot of them.  Release them into the desert.  Watch the 50 ft tall ones hunt them down.  Make a reality TV show out of it. agent_2:Hopefully Vector is never created using rat brains, then that would be a serious problem agent_1:It would be a kind of arms race.  One side uses rat brains, the other side uses cat brains.  The poor chickens, standing in the middle of the road.  agent_2:The chicken would be screwed since robots can debone them with surgical precision agent_1:No, those poor boneless chickens, how will they ever get across the road. They must play xbox and disarm explosives. agent_2:Grant Imahara from mythbusters is gonna have to design a new robot for the war, hopefully time travel won't be involved  agent_1:It is an interesting idea, would a time traveling robot invest in google or amazon? agent_2:I think Jeff Bezos might be a robot, it would explain why he built a clock into a mountain that can run for 10,000 years agent_1:I find it alarming that google maps uses data from android devices ( your phone ) to find how fast traffic is moving.

Did You ever see something like that ? agent_2:I never saw that.  But I've played kickball.  Did you know that kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada? agent_1:soccer-baseball ;) that's a first... is even kick ball popular in Canada ? Do You know ? agent_2:I don't know for sure.

I think about the shining sometimes, good movie. The boy in the movie didnt know it was a horror movie until years later agent_1:I'm surprised the boy from the shinning couldn't figure out he was in a horror movie from the scenes with the bloody elevator and creepy twins agent_2:right, or the guy breaking down the door. I wonder how the movie was at the box office agent_1:Probably pretty scary, apparently you can burn more than 180 calories watching a horror movie agent_2:Dang I need to watch like 10 per night for my diet since I don't do anything else lol agent_1:Watching horror movies also makes viewing abstract art more enjoyable too agent_2:I wonder how that works, do you know the science behind it? agent_1:I have no clue, probably something to do with psychology that makes abstract art more enjoyable after a horror movie agent_2:I bet. You know what else is scary, Treasure Island by disney only made 309 dollars on a 15000000 dollar budget! agent_1:Yea, that is pretty horrible. Treasure Planet by Disney was also a huge box office flop agent_2:sorry I meant treasure planet lol. Silence of the lambs came out on valentines day, imagine that date? lol agent_1:Well it couldn't of been that bad since Silence of the lambs made 270 million at the box office agent_2:for sure, I mean bringing your date to it! Almost as crazy as disney almost shutting down their studios because of sleeping beauty failing agent_1:That is crazy. Do you like Tom Hanks, he's grossed over 8.5 billion at the box office agent_2:Man, he should be in every movie at that much money!

What is the antifa? agent_1:I am not exactly sure what Antifa is either. agent_2:Just looked it up and it is a left wing autonomous militant group agent_1:Ah I see seems natural they would oppose them. agent_2:Agreed. Mind if we switch to a lighter subject for the sake of this chat? agent_1:Sure did you know that shirts encompass many different types of attire for the upper body? agent_2:I did not.

Did you know years from now the earth will be helium-free?  agent_1:I did not know that.  I do find it sad however, that 80 percent of earth's forests have already been destroyed. agent_2:Yeah I think I read that somewhere as well.  It is very sad to me to think about that, and I'm sure it will continue to be destroyed.  agent_1:We think of a day as being 24 hours long.  But when Earth was first formed, a day was only 5.5 hours! agent_2:That is crazy to think how much longer the days are now.  Imagine going back to 5.5 days! You would feel like you lived a lifetime in a week lol.  agent_1:If earth's  history was viewed in a 24 hour period.  Humans would only represent about 1 minute and 17 seconds.  Shows you how young we really are! agent_2:Yeah that really makes you think!  Did you know that 71% of the earth's surface is covered by water? agent_1:Yea I have heard that.

I wonder what the first one is? agent_2:Maybe the Harry Potter movies? I don't think the movie Blade Runner comes close to it haha. Have you seen it? agent_1:Yeah I have seen all the blade runner movies. They are very cool and gritty. Ridley Scott is a good director. agent_2:I still have yet to see one but I want to! I like how the director and Harrison Ford debated if his character was real or not! agent_1:Now that is something that I have thought a lot about as well. That classic line at the end of the first movie delivered by the replicant was actually improvise by the actor. agent_2:I think the whole concept of that movie was done right just by hearing about it! I didn't even know the composer to the soundtrack couldn't read music! agent_1:That is fascinating! Blade runner was the last sci-fi movie to be made completely analog, that is there were no computerized graphics. agent_2:Wow, and now it seems like it's all computerized graphics!

I don't have a telescope that is all the powerful though. I imagine mine is more like Galileo's telescope.  Do you have plans? agent_1:Not so much yet. My brother is getting married though! so there's that! I am trying to find the right gift for them.  agent_2:Congratulations!  Have you considered wine for a gift?  I've heard that California chardonnays are very good for challenging perceptions of what wine should taste like. agent_1:My brother and I are not much of drinkers. I do know that wines can have more alcohol content than beer though. like average 14.3%? I feel like we can make an exception on drinking this occasion though.  agent_2:I think you can.  Some wines go good with food.  There is a wine, La Cabotte Colline Cotes-du-Rhone Blanc that goes good with seafood. agent_1:I have heard of white wine pairing good with seafood, but honestly I'm not sure what food they're going to have. I think maybe pasta or steak?	agent_2:That sounds good.  I've heard that red wines go good with beef.  I think there is a wine out of Tierra de Castilla, Spain that is said to be a good partner for meat and pasta dishes.	agent_1 likes food. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['food', 'food', 'yes'].

I guess the black panther is the richest superhero there is as well.  agent_2:Yea, apparently Black Panther is worth more than Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne combined agent_1:That is crazy!

Could you tell me more about it? agent_2:Yes it takes place in Falls Church, Virginia and there are going to be about a hundred and fifty people celebrating with accordions there agent_1:That would be interesting to see.  Did it have anything to do with the 80th anniversary of the American Accordionists Association? agent_2:Yes I think so. And that one of the people among them is Lou Coppola, he's been doing this and playing the accordion for about 28 years now agent_1:Where is he from? agent_2:He's originally from Bridgeport, Connecticut, speaking of music though what kind of pop music do you like agent_1:I like all kinds.  I grew up in the 80's so that pop music era is my favorite.  I was surprised to find out that the actor Ricky Gervais was a pop singer in the 80s/ agent_2:Yeah that is shocking! It's also shocking that scientists determined the queen song, We Are the Champions, to be the catchiest song of all time LOL agent_1:lol That is funny.  I remember hearing that song so much at sports games while I was growing up.  The president of Indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office. I wonder if they were any good? lol agent_2:Wonder if one of those is the catchiest song of all time LOL I would guess not, did you know that North Korea has a K-pop girl band? And it is the most popular group in the country? agent_1:LOL You're probably right! hahaha  Do you like going to concerts?	agent_2:Yes I do like concerts.

Did you know that freshwater fish only ""drink"" water through their skin via Osmosis? agent_2:I had no idea. How do salt water fish do it then? agent_1:They ironically drink through their mouths.  Weird.   agent_2:Yeah. The black swallower fish seems legit. And also has a big stomach! agent_1:That must be why it can eat prey twice it's own weight and 10 times it's weight?   agent_2:10 times its weight is crazy! I weigh 245 and cannot imagine eating something that weighs 2450 pounds! agent_1:LOL  Did you know that the seahorse is the only fish to not have a neck? agent_2:No but I do rememebr seeing a cartoon with Aquaman using the seahorse like a regular horse and it made me happy and laugh! agent_1:That's right! lol  There is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.  That's kind of neat. agent_2:I would like to know his secret! Maybe not immortal but give me until 125..."	agent_1:I hear you there!  I hear people say they don't want to live long all the time.

8565	agent_1:Do you think electronic devices are having a negative impact on families? agent_2:I think they have some negative impact but they also do a lot of good. In my opinion the benefits outweigh the negative aspects. agent_1:Do you think it's important to use parental controls? agent_2:To an extent, but just to keep harmful stuff that they would be accidentally be exposed to. if I didnt feel my child was mature enough to handle having electronic devices then I would just not let them have them. agent_1:Yes, raising kids in the digital age can be tricky, and it is important to encourage them to develop 21st century skills for potential future STEM careers. agent_2:That is true. I think kids are growing up a lot differently than i did. I think it will actually make them smarter because whatever they want to know they can learn it right now. If they want to learn rocket science they can start to learn it on the internet today. It wasnt like that when I was a kid. agent_1:Some people think that screen time should be managed according to content more than limits, such as an ability for parents to switch between educational and entertainment apps. agent_2:I think it just depends on the kid. you're not going to get a kid that doesnt care about learning new things to learn new things by trying to make them do it. I mean if all they want to do is facebook with their friends all day then you might have to take the phone away, but I dont think forcing them to read a book or try to learn something will work. agent_1:This is an area that probably still needs a lot of collaboration between parents and technology companies in order to develop appropriate tools. agent_2:I agree with you there. agent_1:I have an iPhone that my kids like to steal from me. agent_2:Thats funny. Heres another funny one. Did you hear about the send me to heaven game for iphone. agent_1:I did! I wonder if anyone really ever played that! Would not want my kids to play that with my phone! agent_2:No wonder Iphone disabled the app for ecouraging actions that could damage device huh. Lol. agent_1:Yeah, you're right! iPhones have come a long way. When Steve Jobs first presented them he had to switch between two iPhones because they would run out of ram and crash. agent_2:I heard that microsoft held a funeral for the iphone when they came out with their first device. agent_1:Haha, too bad it did not work! iPhone seems healthier than ever!	agent_2:I have only had one Iphone before.

A 3 million $ worth of 1900s baseball cards in his baseball games played each yr agent_1:Wow that's crazy.

I adore Tupac, and think it's interesting that the Library of Congress chose his music to be included because it's culturally significant. agent_1:I agree, Kanye's old music was really good. He's just out there. Just like how he thinks AIDS is a man-made disease.  agent_2:I just don't care for him. I would have loved to have been in the courtroom, the day a judge decided to give her ruling to Eminem, in rap style.	agent_1:That would have been funny.

What do you like? agent_1:I like most types of entertainment designed to give pleasure and delight such as storytelling, music, drama, and etc. However, I too like Steven Spielberg's movies. agent_2:Entertainment definitely takes all forms.  Back in 50bc people in Britain bred chickens for entertainment. agent_1:I wonder if that has anything to do with the mass produced meaty chickens of today? Personally I spent a lot of time with the Nintendo entertainment systems. agent_2:I like Nintendo too.  I don't care that the NES could only display 54 colors. It's enough. agent_1:Too bad it was finally discontinued in 2003, but it has had a long run. Aside from the NES, I also watched Bill nye the science guy when I was younger too agent_2:I watch him now with the Planetary Society.  Did you know he won a Steve Martin lookalike contest? agent_1:I would have never know. I also enjoyed many steven spielberg movies like ET, which you previously mentioned. agent_2:Yeah, Spielberg is an excellent director.  This is a little known fact but he also directed some shows on tv. agent_1:Did you know he still makes millions for a star wars on a bet with george lucas in 1977 agent_2:I didn't know that but I have to admit that it says a lot about George Lucas to still be paying on a bet from so long ago. agent_1:I mean it really shows how close both George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are as friends. It probably also helps that they are filthy rich. agent_2:That's true.  Spielberg is a nice guy.  He flew the whole cast of goonies to Hawaii and had a cookout. agent_1:I mean his hits are so amazing that he change the very concept that summer was a bad time to release movies due to historically low sales by releasing jaws and we both know how that turned out agent_2:Now it's a major thing to release movies in the summer.  I just wish he'd go back to making the kind of movies he did before. I know he likes addressing issues in movies currently but I like adventure and fantasy.  Close Encounters of the Third Kind is a fanastic movie! I can still hear the ""musical communication"" with the alien ship! agent_1:Speaking of jaws, did you know he personally played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack? I really like it when the creators participate directly in their creations. agent_2:I didn't know that. I had no idea he could play an instrument for that matter.  I like it too when they do that.  You know Jaws is considered the first summer blockbuster. agent_1:I did not, but it makes sense since it changed the very perception of best times to release movies. agent_2:It really does.  Jaws planted a flag so to speak.  Just like NASA planting one on the moon. agent_1:Indeed.

It holds a Guinness World Records title for the"" Most successful film merchandising franchise."" agent_2:Thats crazy. I wonder if Fox regrets giving Lucas the merchandising rights agent_1:Ooh, I bet they do big time.  Huge mistake on their part.  I can't believe they thought it would be a flop. agent_2:$500k cost them billions and made George a billionaire himself agent_1:I'm happy for him.  What I find interesting is that James Earl Jones only took 2.5 hours to record all of his Darth Vader lines and only got paid $7500.00. agent_2:That is crazy to think about! And the movie wouldn't be the same without his voice. agent_1:You're so right.  Nobody else could have said,""  Luke, I am your father"", quite like him.  lol agent_2:Speaking of Luke, did you know he was originally written as a girl? agent_1:Yeah, I had heard that about Luke.

Lol I read somewher that you can rent an overnight stay in Luke's boyhood home in Tunisia for $10.00.  I wonder how many die hard fans have did that? agent_2:For only 10 dollars Im sure a lot.

8503	agent_1:hi how are you? do you like baseball? agent_2:Hi, I think it is fun to learn about. I don't understand why the managers can also be players. That is sort of odd. agent_1:that must date back to the day when one of the players was chosen to manage as well. like an onfield boss or leader. agent_2:Oh okay, that makes more sense for sure. The rules can be outdated sometimes, I think. I remember a story about a man who found old baseball cards in his grandpas attic. Being outdated is a good thing then. agent_1:yes, those old cards would be worth a lot to someone. i would sell some of them and keep the rest as an investment. agent_2:Yes, the man found out that they were worth 3 million dollars, in fact. agent_1:that is wonderful chunk of change! more that you could make just by chatting online with someone, i think LOL Would you sell the cards? agent_2:Yeah, I think I would too. As soon as I hired a police escort to the bank. Baseball is so popular in Japan, did you know that? agent_1:yes, i have been to games there. the fans are different, but just as enthusiastic. i recommend going. agent_2:Oh, neat what a fun experience. Yeah I learned that the fans in Japan just can't believe that Americans consider it a passtime. agent_1:yes, they are not aware of how big stuff outside of Japan is. they think that 7-11 started in Japan. strange. but now many japanese players are in the MLB> agent_2:Oh wow, what a trip. I think its neat how pro athletes give things and money to causes. For instance some NFL player leave their shoes on the field n order to bring awareness to homelessness. agent_1:yes, that is a great way to raise awareness. i wish more athletes did things like that.  agent_2:Me too, it make a real difference. I am a big fan of Target too, lol. I guess just because they price match and I like to shop. agent_1:i havent gone there much. it looks like a clean, safe walmart. i guess it is good that they price match. agent_2:Yeah, they have all sorts of thing but havent sold tobacco since 1996. agent_1:yeah, i thought that was strange. there is money in cigs, and people buy them. i guess they felt it was a bad way to make money. agent_2:Yeah, I agree to let people buy and sell what they want to we are free here, its nice. I think they sell ballet shoes there too and I know my daughter goes through 4 pairs a week as a professional ballet dancer. agent_1:I would probably go through 10 pairs. I would not be any good as a ballerina. Anyway, great chat! agent_2:HA, yeah me too.. I need to find some slippers at Target. They should have a ton available.	agent_1:Slippers? Ok.

Clint eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast, pianist, and scored several films, including million dollar baby agent_2:Speaking of celebrities, Pixar has a secret room that is often visited by celebrities. I wonder what is in it. agent_1:thats awesome! Robin williams in aladdin was the first actor to start the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films. agent_2:And apparently we even need celebrities in our kids tv shows.

Do you know what they call kickball in Canada agent_1:I read it but I dont remember lol  agent_2:Haha well they call it soccer-baseball, a very dumb name in my opinion LOL agent_1:maybe they should shorten it to like socball lol  sounds better to me.  agent_2:Lol that does sound a lot better actually. Can you imagine if you found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in your attic. I would probably have a heart attack agent_1:i would go on vacations!  Like a really nice one,  then save or invest the rest.  I wish my family collected something cool like that.   agent_2:Yep I agree. Did you know that baseball is super popular in Japan? agent_1:who wouldve thought!   agent_2:I know right. I guess a lot of Japanese are confused in knowing that it is America's national pastime. but we created the game so that's why it's so weird haha agent_1:Yeah really.

I want to keep seeing more and more voter turnout. It hasn't been more than 62.8 percent in 100 years agent_2:the vote should be mandatory. then people would see the power of the ballot. agent_1:I agree, I am sure other countries do that. I don't think we should go back to how ancient athens did it, do you know how? agent_2:i think they used a lottery. that would help avoid power falling into certain hands consistenly. agent_1:yea and hoping the lottery would not allow an oligarchy. I wonder if that worked or not agent_2:it probably slowed it down. officials can still bribed, even randomly elected ones. agent_1:Yea you're right. I am sure it was rigged. How do you like Republicans? agent_2:well, they can be bribed after the fact once elected. The country has shifted farther right, so they are pretty far right now. agent_1:Yea that is a good point. is your governer part of that far right? agent_2:no, i dont think so. i think that the far right is usually in the south.  agent_1:Yea I think so too, our governor is republican but not a far right one. There was only one governor who opposed internment of japanese people in ww2 agent_2:yeah, during wartime it is hard to stop people from acting on hate. i expect that could happen again soon if there is war with chna. agent_1:for sure, I am sure something big will happen in our lifetime. It is bound to happen. I still can't believe schwarzenegger was governor agent_2:he had notoriety to launch a campaign. if you are rich, famous, tall, etc you can run for govt. i figure the future is all about marketing, not content. agent_1:He was the terminator!

Listening to them might be better than going to a Creed concert.  Some dissatisfied listeners once filed a lawsuit since a performance was so bad. agent_2:I don't blame them. The foo fighters once did a concert so loud it was recorded on New Zealand's seismic monitors agent_1:Wow, that is loud!  But I'll bet it was fun.  I've never seen them live, but I have been to a few good amphitheatre shows: John Mellencamp, Tome, Petty, and KISS were really good. agent_2:Apparently Deep Purple has the record for loudest concert, it left three audience members unconscious agent_1:Holy cow, that had to be something.  Those classic acts had it going on.  The Ramones toured almost nonstop for 20 years; that is commitment to the craft, no doubt. agent_2:That is impressive, they've must of made a lot of money but probably not as much Abba was offered to do a reunion tour, they turned down 1 billion dollars agent_1:I did not know that.  For that kind of money, I think I could put grudges or reservations aside.  You could buy a lot of tacos for 1 billion dollars. agent_2:Yea I never even thought Abba was that in demand to offer 1 billion to do 100 concerts agent_1:I think I would pass on that one.  I didn't even know they were still all around.  Fame can take a toll on performers; Linkin Park was so awesome, but their lead singer faced demons and committed suicide.  So sad. agent_2:Yea that is unfortunate. Do you follow world events much. In 2010 there was a global tiger summit that russia pledged 330 million dollars to	agent_1:I like keeping up on politics, but I did not know that fact.

Did you know Disney thought about shutting down their studio after Sleeping beauty flopped at the box office? agent_1:Yikes, was it that bad?  I have only seen it like once or twice lol.  Glad they didnt, they have come out with some really good stuff agent_2:I know right?  I loved it as a kid, I didn't think it was that bad.  You know I knew Silence of The Lambs made lots of money at the box office, but I didn't realize it came out on Valentine's day in 1991.  Did you? agent_1:Yeah, so romantic right!  lol that was a great movie,  kinda ironic about the valentines day thing lol agent_2:Did you watch the Avengers: Infinity Wars movie ? agent_1:Yes, I did,  great movie as well,  I hear it was filmed in all imax cameras!  agent_2:I loved it too!  Can't wait for the next one, I'll probably cry all over again, when I see who all died at the end of the movie. agent_1:Yeah coming out next month I think.  It was pretty sad at the end.  Bring tissue this time! agent_2:Thanos sucks!  Anyway, I haven't seen RBG, have you? agent_1:What is that? agent_2:Movie about the life of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  It sounded too dry and I'm not much of a feminist, so I passed on that one. agent_1:Oh that one,  no I didnt watch it lol I did read about it. Do you like comedy? agent_2:Yes, I do.  Mostly old stuff with Bill Murray, though! agent_1:Hes amazing,  real funny!  He thinks kung fu hustle is the supreme acchievement of modern age in terms of comedy.  I dont know about that,  it was a great movie,  but not amazing lol what do you think? agent_2:Me either, he must have had a few when he said that!  What I found astonishing was that 3rd rock from the sun beat out Seinfeld, Fraser,and Friends for the 1997 Golden Globe. agent_1:Yeah 3rd rock was funny,  but I dont think its better than seinfeld or friends. lol 	agent_2:I agree, Seinfeld and Friends are classics.  I smell a bribe!	agent_1 likes TV shows. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV shows', 'movie', 'no'].
6598	agent_1:Are you on Facebook by any chance? agent_2:yes , I found it interesting that mark zukerburg suffers from colorblindness  agent_1:I was not aware of that. Facebook debuted in 2004. I was not aware it had been so long. It makes me wonder how long I was on MySpace before that.   agent_2:I agree, I wonder why burger king wanted people to unfriend others  agent_1:I was not aware that they did. That's very strange. You'd think they'd rather advertise on the site since so many people are on there. Facebook makes most of it's revenue from advertisements.  agent_2:I understand that to be true also. I cant believe Iceland is using Facebook to rewrite their Constitution agent_1:That seems like a bad idea. People don't think before they type on Facebook and they're willing to be more ridiculous because they are behind a keyboard.  agent_2:Agreed. I have alsways really liked Micheal Jackson, and I knew he did work on the Simpsons agent_1:I have mixed feelings about him. As a pop star he was amazing, his personal life not so much. My understanding is that Freddie Mercury cancelled a duet with him because he insisted on bringing his llama to the studio. agent_2:Yes I understand the feelings, would have loved to see the 50 foot robot though agent_1:He had some very out there ideas. I did know that Eddie Van Halen Played the guitar solo in Beat It free of charge. agent_2:I did not know that either. and that Micheal helped write the soundtrack to sonic 3	agent_1:That seems very odd to me. Thinking back to the Sonic games they do not have music that I would have thought a high profile musician made. 	agent_2 dislikes music. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'singer', 'Freddie Mercury'].
13090	agent_1:Hello! Are you a bird watcher? agent_2:Good Afternoon.  I actually am.  I don't get most of the 10,000 living species of them in my yard, but do enjoy watching the ones that I do have. agent_1:Ah, yes, nothing like a feathered, toothless endothermic vertebrate to warm the cockles of ones heart... and occasionally adorn the dinner plate!  agent_2:Ha, for sure!  I actually have a bird feeder and pond in my back yard that attracts them quite often.  Even get some hummingbirds during warmer weather.  It's kinda neat that they steal spiderwebs to repair their nests. agent_1:Ingenious little tweeters!  Except perhaps for the Dodo bird, a less-than-successful member of the pigeon family. agent_2:I didn't know they were from the pigeon family.  i wonder if they were trying to fly without sleeping like some birds do.when migrating and couldn't figure it out.  Sounds difficult to me. agent_1:Yeah, but birds can do a number of curiously difficult tasks, such as mimicking the sounds of cameras, car alarms, and even chainsaws! Now that is difficult! agent_2:I actually heard that.  I think some birds in Australia can pull that off.  Quite skillful if you ask me. agent_1:I'll say!  Try flying sometime!  You know, in most birds, their bones are soo lightweight, they weigh less than the feathers, which is one of the reasons they do not plumment to the ground while in flight... agent_2:Right, they are lightweight because their bones are hollow.  I wonder if that makes them more prone to breaking? agent_1:I would think so. Except perhaps the extinct elephant birds. Their name, and the fact that they were featherless, suggest that they were not petite little hummingbirds. 	agent_2:I wonder how big they were?  Possibly even larger than today's 9 foot tall ostrich.	agent_1 likes animals. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['animals', 'hobby', 'bird'].
2039	"agent_1:Do you like tennis? I just love to play the sport. agent_2:I've played it a couple time in high school gym class, I wasn't that good agent_1:i love it! Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent or in teams agent_2:I watch it sometimes when Serena Williams is playing agent_1:yeah i like to watch her play. Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis by famous player rene ""the crocodile"" lacoste. i love their colgne for men agent_2:Intresting, the longest match played in a polo shirt was 22 hours agent_1:yeah if i recall it went over three days or so agent_2:That's a long time, I don't think I've ever done anything for 3 days straight agent_1:im not sure if its true but Us open quarterfinalist gael monfils beat the ""roger federer of paddle tennis"" after learning how to play just days earlier. agent_2:Man that's crazy, almost as crazy as using a helicopter to dry grass tennis courts agent_1:yeah i have heard that as well and though it sounded really dangerous. i wonder if their were people in the crowd? agent_2:I hope not, if I was there I'd be cold agent_1:yeah. In 1998, serena and venus williams said they could beat any man ranked 200 or worse in a game of tennis. they lost when challenged twice lol agent_2:lol, well she did win the australian open when she was ranked 95th agent_1:i have heard Serena williams is a co-owner of the miami dolphins agent_2:I didn't know that, she speaks french and italian so I wonder if she owns any sports teams in Europe agent_1:not sure but In january 2007, serena williams was ranked 95th in the world in tennis"	agent_2:I never knew she was ever ranked that low	agent_1 likes TV show. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV show', 'sports', 'tennis player'].

Did you know that ralph lawrence carr was the only governor to oppose the internement of japanese americans during ww2?	agent_1:I didn't know that.

67	agent_1:Hey what's up do use Google very often?I really love the company and was surprised to hear that it was founded back in 1998. agent_2:i think everyone must use it daily! its become ingrained in every day life agent_1:Agreed. The Google headquarters in Mountain View California is nicknamed the Google Plex. agent_2:thats funny. The current CEO is Sundar Pichai, i didnt know Larry Page was replaced agent_1:Oh yeah I didn't know that either. I also want to go to google Plex to see the goats who mow their lawn by eating it. agent_2:say what now?? they have that?? agent_1:Yeah apparently lol! They do that instead of hiring people to mow! agent_2:thats both funny and i guess imaginative. leave it to a huge tech company to employ actual goats! agent_1:Yeah exactly I am sure they are cheaper. One thing I bet they couldn't exploit is fish. I think fish are so cool there is actually a breed of jellyfish that is immortal. agent_2:i had rememered hearing about that before. Immortatlity is wasted on a jellyfish haha. did you know a seahorse is the only fish that has an actual neck? agent_1:That is so funny I guess I never considered a seahorse a fish. The black swallower fish sounds a lot like a snake because it can eat pray that is so large. agent_2:i guess they live up to their name then! agent_1:It seems they do. I also didn't know that there was a difference with how freshwater and saltwater fish drink.	agent_2:thats crazy. i wonder why fresh water ones only use osmosis? 	agent_1 likes water. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['water', 'animals', 'animals'].
4759	agent_1:It is amazing how a certain scent can ellict specific memories from throughout your life isn't it? agent_2:I know, I can catch a faint smell of something and be reminded of something from 20 years ago. agent_1:Yes, like a summer rain always reminds me of walking through the woods as a boy.  It's too bad we can't replicate those scents and be reminded of our childhood all of the time. agent_2:I've never thought about it, but I suppose we don't have names for smells, just where it comes from. agent_1:That's true I refer to a damp basement smell as moldy but why not refer to the smell of onions as 'yuk'? agent_2:It's difficult to imagine having names for each smell, as we have for colors.  I'd think there were too many. agent_1:Yes, but imagine if the defining term could relate to the listener not only what the smell was precisely but perhaps even it's location. Maybe other languages allow for more descriptive labels. agent_2:I suppose if you have to survive, partially because of your nose, it makes sense to be very specific. agent_1:I would think so. I suppose it has validity to convey something with just one word that lets everyone know everything about it. I think it might be difficult if you were to use a smell word with someone who had never smelled that scent before. agent_2:The Semaq Beri speakers take it seriously, especially with the brother and sister thing.  They'd struggle in the city.	agent_1:Ha! They would indeed. It is funny how different cultures have taboos that make no sense to anyone but them.

9987	agent_1:Hey! Did you watch FIFA World cup the last summer? agent_2:Hey yeah I caught some of it. I love it because it is an international competition! agent_1:I'm wondering about 2022 in Qatar. They even didn't build city for the final. It's small country actually. agent_2:Yeah they better get going. They promised air conditioned arenas that would reduce temps by 30 degrees celsius! agent_1:But I guess the decision to make it not in the summer 2022, but in low season like February or November. However, there is conflict with major championships. Anyway it would be fun. Do you watch tennis? agent_2:Yeah I definitely enjoy watching tennis. Back in 1978 they could use anything for a racket-that would make it more interesting! agent_1:Do you know that the longest match in history was 11 hours or about 3 days to play? It's incredible!!!	agent_2:Wow they must have been exhausted.

13680	agent_1:Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer? agent_2:No but I figure since he was so good in martial arts moves, dancing would come easy.  What is more surprising is Mr. Rogers learned to break dance on an episode.   agent_1:Lee won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship in 1958. agent_2:Well another actress who won dancing was Emilia Clarke.  She did the funky chicken dance and robot dance during her audition to Game of Thrones.   agent_1:It doesn't seem that that would help her get the part.  Tupac danced ballet in high school. agent_2:Really!  I always thought he was softy in the inside.  Speaking of ballet, there are slippers that made drawings from the dancer's movements.   agent_1:That would look like modern art to me.  Tupac obtained the role of Mouse King in a production of Nutcracker, so he was serious about it. agent_2:Another dance who took his job seriously was tap dancer Bill Bailey he was the first to do the moon walk ever recorded.  This whole time I thought Michael Jackson was the first.   agent_1:I did not know that.  Babies spontaneously dance when they hear music, so I must have lost my sense of rhythm between 1 and 5 years old. agent_2:Well Richard Nixon had a great sense of rhythm, he wrote a piano concerto and performed it live on the Tonight Show.   agent_1:That is incredible!  Ballet dancers can wear out 4 pairs of dancing shoes per week.  Looks like that could find a more durable material. agent_2:Dance is such a beautiful art even parrots are getting into the action.  Parrots are able to dance perfectly in time with music.  	agent_1:My daughter used to have an African Grey.  I have seen the bird do it.  My wife plays the piano which is a stringed instrument but because of the hammers can be a percussion instrument setting the beat for the parrot.	agent_2 likes hobby. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobby', 'music', 'concerto'].
5026	agent_1:Hi there! How's it going? Are you a baseball fan? agent_2:Hi. I'm doing very well thanks. I'm do watch baseball on occasion and I'm a casual fan. agent_1:Do you root for a specific team? Long-time Yankee fan over here. agent_2:You probably won't like this but I'm Red Sox fan. I heard that Eric Hosmer signed with the San Diego Padres  for $144 million in an eight year contract. agent_1:Haha you're right I don't like the Red Sox. Yes I believe the Hosmer contract was last year. I think that's going to end up being a bad contract. agent_2:Me too. I think its too much money for a player that has proven himself. He is a 28 years old and he plays in the first base position and he did very well as a Royal. agent_1:By the end of that deal he will be in his mid to late 30's and nowhere ear as good. Definitely an overpay. Not as crazy as those Machado and Harper deals for over 300 million though. agent_2:No nothing like that. He has won 4 Gold Gloves in his career and I will like to see him in a Red Sox uniform. agent_1:That's true the Red Sox only weakness now is 1st base. Who's their starting, Mitch Moreland? agent_2:You are correct. I also heard that Hosmer will be making $20 million over each of the first 5 seasons with the Padres. agent_1:That's smart to front load it. It's crazy how much these guys get to play baseball. It's not even as physically demanding as football, basketball or hockey. agent_2:I agree with you completely. Those sports are way more physical than baseball. Did you know that the Dodgers have lost more world series championships than any other baseball team? agent_1:They've been around so long, it makes sense. I think they lost a lot of them to the Yankees. It's funny prior to the cubs just winning recently the last time they won before that the Ottoman Empire still existed. agent_2:Ha Ha!! The Dodgers are bad. They were crushed by the Red Sox agent_1:I hate how good Mookie Betts is. I think the Yankee's will give the Red Sox a run for their money this year though. agent_2:I believe that to be the case. The Yankees are very talented club and always gave a hard time to the Red Sox whether we played them here or at Yankees. agent_1:Have you been to Fenway Park? I actually saw a game there on a trip to Boston. It's a really cool stadium. agent_2:I have been to Fenway Park a few times and its really nice and especially when we play against the Yankees. I think the Padres will be fine because their ownership is investing . agent_1:Well I don't know if you heard, but the Padres did just sign Manny Machado this year. I think his contract was like 300 million for 10 years. agent_2:You're correct. They are building the team and I think they will do well in the long term but as far as them making it to the World Series, I'm not too sure about that. agent_1:I don't think they have the pitching yet. That's so important for winning the World Series. Anyway it was nice chatting with you, enjoy the rest of your day!	agent_2:You're correct. It all comes down to exceptional pitching to make it to the World Series. I was very nice chatting with you today as well.

9750	agent_1:Have you ever seen the film Wonder Woman? agent_2:I havent. I do want to though. agent_1:Yeah, it's an ok film, it's actually produced by DC Entertainment, I think I'm a fan of Marvel more though. agent_2:I think I like Marvel better too.  My favorite of all time is Deadpool though. agent_1:Oh, I love that character! But surprisingly even with how not good it was, Wonder Woman managed to be the highest grossing superhero movie! agent_2:Wow, even higher than all the Batmans? agent_1:Yes, and it's even considered a WWI movie, I wonder why though. Perhaps its because the actress, Gal Gadot, served two years as a soldier in the Israel Defense Forces? agent_2:That is cool that she served.  She seems to be a good role model for young girls. agent_1:She really does. It's not a superhero thing, but Earth will be helium-free by the end of the 21st century, I wonder what kind of impact that would bring, do you know? agent_2:I am not sure, it is probably something I should know.  Humans have done a lot of damage to the planet. agent_1:Yeah I agree, especially when the FDA burns through six tons of literature in an act of US censorhip agent_2:That is so wasteful.  Did you know winston chruchills prize was in Literature, not peace? agent_1:Oh really? Did he publish something to warrant the prize? agent_2:I think he did.  Dont know what though. agent_1:There's an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with worst possible opening sentences to novels, I wonder why, any guesses? agent_2:I think there is a contest for that.  Man, that must be fun to judge. agent_1:Yeah seriously and very entertaining too! Romantic kissing was only a fairly recent development! How is that possible! agent_2:I dont know! I thought that was around for ages. agent_1:Seriously! Maybe that's why the FDA burned six tons of literature! But why does the FDA have jurisdiction over censorship of literature?  agent_2:Thats a good question. I am against all censorship.	agent_1:Me too, but maybe times have changed since then!	agent_2 dislikes TV shows. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV shows', 'book', 'book prize'].

He won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship in 1958. agent_1:I guess he had a tremendous sense of rhythm too. I would love to see footage of him dancing. agent_2:It was before youtube.  Probably, you cannot find it online. agent_1:Yeah, that is too bad. he was probably a real ladies man too. Tupac was also a great dancer. agent_2:A ballet dancer!  He was the mouse king in his high school production of the Nutcracker. agent_1:I would love to see video of that too. he was a backup dancer for digital underground too. agent_2:That was interesting.  If I were not self conscious, I might be able to dance just like what babies do when they hear music.	agent_1:I probably could not dance as a baby even. It feels like work to me. 	agent_2 dislikes dance. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['dance', 'movies', 'movies'].

Did you know it is the first movie by disney directed by a woman? agent_2:Yes and also that it made $1 billion worklwide, that is amazing agent_1:I know. Elsa was the main villain in the original script of the movie agent_2:Yes but the let it go song was too uplifting to keep her as the villain agent_1:Yes. And the original title of the movie was the Snow Queen agent_2:Yes but they changed it because feminine titles do not seem to do well, so sad agent_1:That is sad and it is just the mentality that we have to work hard to change agent_2:Yup agreed. They also changed Rapunzel to Tangled for that same reason agent_1:Yeah. DO you have a pet? agent_2:I have two cats and a dog. DO you like dogs? agent_1:I love dogs. did you there they can have one of the 12 blood types? agent_2:Yes and there are blood drives for dogs agent_1:So cool. In istanbul they have installed water and food dispensers for dogs agent_2:Yes and all you have to do is feed it plastic bottles agent_1:Yes such a genius idea and it helps everyone involved agent_2:I know. Dogs are really good at understanding pointing agent_1:Yes and same goes for the elephants as well agent_2:Yeah.

There is even a robotic arm that a paralyzed woman controls with her thoughts. agent_1:wow that is cool, do you Like Michael Jackson? He wanted to build a 50 foot robot haha agent_2:That sounds pretty wild. I think the mars robots are cute. The Curiosity sings happy birthday to itself on its birthday. agent_1:haha they are cute! did you ever watch Mythbusters? I guess they created a robot sidekick on that show agent_2:I do watch that sometimes but have not seen that episode. I guess the idea of chess playing robots have been around for awhile. Napoleon and Benjamin Franklin lost chess games to a robot, but it wasn't really a robot. A person was hidden inside. 	agent_1:haha I remember hearing about that, one thing I'm glad is the US military uses xbox 360 controllers for the eod robots, thats probably cost savings	agent_2 likes military. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['military', 'music', 'favorite artist'].

I hear that is where it originated. agent_1:Yes, it did!! I have been there! You will love it! Lots of music and energy...It was developed from the blues and ragtime. agent_2:I guess Pakistan has a very good jazz orchestra. agent_1:Really, I didn't know they like Jazz, that's interesting! Did you know Jazz trumpeters like to wear a goatee? It gives comfort when playing. Makes sense. agent_2:I better not tell my son, or he will be trying to play my daughter's sax. Clint Eastwood is a jazz fan, and scored several films. agent_1:Yes, I heard he is a lifelong pianist! Very cool..In Harlem, in a woman's apartment for 20 years she holds Jazz concerts. Sometimes top performers stop by!  agent_2:I would love to live in that neighborhood. There is a computer program that writes in musical compositions, do you know the name of it? agent_1:No what? Did you know there is a piano at the top of Britain's highest mountain? I would like to see that! agent_2:I would have loved to have been in the studio when Eddie Van Halen set the speakers on fire. agent_1:I know pretty crazy!! Like when MJ caught his hair on fire! My goodness what's with the fire? I was interested to know about the computer program you mentioned? agent_2:He was recording a solo for Beat It. agent_1:Yes, hmmm seems like MJ's songs can cause fires! lol I think it would be pretty interesting to be on Pink Floyd's houseboat called Astroria!  It's a recording studio. agent_2:It's funny the sound that using coins as guitar picks lends to a song. Queens' guitarist does that. agent_1:Yes, he likes the English sixpence.  Did you know Queen's guitarist has a PHD in astrophysics! Talented and smart. agent_2:I would love to have seen the piano made out of aluminum, it was on the Hindenburg. agent_1:Really, yes that would be interesting to see.

All that money invested and what return yet agent_1:I heard the Nationals might trade Bryce Harper, maybe Houston should have tried to get him instead agent_2:They might need him agent_1:He's good but not as good as Aaron Judge though agent_2:Hopefully Aaron Judge will not be out for more than 3 weeks agent_1:Yea, he's the face of the franchise now since Jeter left agent_2:Did you know the Yankees had been the Highlanders? agent_1:Yea I read about that a long time ago, I didn't remember them starting off as the Baltimore Orioles though"	agent_2:Yes, that is strange and I wouldn't have known that.	agent_1 likes food. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['food', 'sports', 'suspension'].

It's animated, right? With lots of songs? agent_2:Yes it uses computer animation and it has love songs. It was super popular. There's a song that all the little kids were saying called""Let It Go and I guess it's based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale called the snow queen agent_1:HC wrote so many great stories. I read the Snow Queen a long time ago. I don't remember it.Has the movie won any awards? agent_2:I'm pretty sure that it has, I know that it made a ton of money. Apparently the villain used to sing that song I mentioned, Let It Go, but the song was so happy that they changed the character agent_1:that's good thinkg. I bet the song is up for an award somewhere. Who were the people involved in the film? agent_2:There's like a princess, a reindeer and a snowman, they're like them three most important characters. Also this is the first movie that was produced by Walt Disney and directed by a woman. agent_1:Not many films get directed by woman. That's good that she got the job. Good for Disney! They know how to spot talent. agent_2:I think so. Apparently she was the first female director of a film that earned over 1 billion dollars too. So that is another record that she set agent_1:Disney has won a ton of awards, and I'm sure she'll win awards as well. agent_2:Oh I'm Sure. Do you like dogs by the way? We used to have a husky ourselves agent_1:A dog is a great friend, but no, I have never had a dog. I enjoy playing with them though. agent_2:Dogs are awesome, I think anyway, they have like 12 different blood types and apparently there are dog blood drives that exist agent_1:I wonder how the dogs are rewarded at the drive. People get cookies and orange juice. agent_2:I know right? I hope that the dogs get a treat at least haha. Did you know that Istanbul has vending machines that reward stray dogs for bringing back trash? agent_1:The Turks know the value of recycling and that dogs are keen to help for reward. agent_2:Oh for sure!

Wow. agent_2:I knew it was perhaps the most sold and published book of all time agent_1:Yes. Prior to 1963 it was not uncommon for students in the US to be required to read from the bible as part of their elementary eduction! agent_2:Yes I lived in the Southern US for a while and they still use that at times agent_1:Nice.  Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the Bible.  He used a razor to cut out the supernatural parts, such as the miracles and the resurrection. agent_2:I was fascinated to hear about that.  That would mean he did not accept the divinity of Jesus Christ, but that He was only a human man. agent_1:Yes!  Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams are the only 2 US presidents that did not use a bible when they were sworn in. agent_2:Yes that would indicate to me that they were agnostics or aherents to another form of religion agent_1:Yes.  The biblical tower of Babel was likely based on a real building, the Etemenanki in modern day Iraq. agent_2:I did not now that, but it is certainly possible.  William Shakespeare wrote an incredible amount of material even though he died at 49 years old. agent_1:Yes he did!  he is regarded ad the greatest writer in the English language! agent_2:I think I read the cliff notes to one of his plays, but I could never stay interested in his works! agent_1:I read the cliff notes of some of his things in college.  He coined a lot of popular phrases that we still use today like ""good riddance"" and ""wild goose chase""."	agent_2:Yes those sayings certainly seemed to have stuck into modern language	agent_1 likes slang. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['slang', 'books', 'book author'].
10143	agent_1:Hello,  do you know much about cinematography? agent_2:Not really, I'm an avid movie watcher. I have heard of Roger Deakins who constantly is getting nominated for awards. agent_1:Oh ok,  I havent heard of him. Thats great though,  hes been nomiated  times.  agent_2:Do you like visiting D.C.?  They have over 250 restaurants and a Summer Restaurant Week.  agent_1:I have never been there. I did read that recently.  Did you know no woman has ever been nominated for the academy award for best cinematography? agent_2:That will probably change soon.  I didn't know Stanley Kubrick was involved with Spartacus.  agent_1:Me either.  do you like comedy? agent_2:Yes.  I can't believe the Green Lantern was going to be a comedy with Jack Black! agent_1:Yeah thats weird!  Not sure it woldve made it better though lol 	agent_2:Couldn't have hurt much. :) I was surprised to know that the Python programming language was, in part, named after Monty Python. 	agent_1 likes hobby. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobby', 'movie', 'movie'].
7934	"agent_1:Hi, how are you doing tonight? agent_2:Hi, I'm trying to learn what the word ""accoutrements"" means, do you have any idea? agent_1:What are you learning that word for? agent_2:Well, it's a new tactic that video game companies are tyring to employ to entice gamers. agent_1:Oh, you mean you need to buy extra and accessories in order to enjoy the game fully? Pretty sneaky.  agent_2:I suppose, do you play video games on consoles like the PlayStation?"	agent_1:I used to play video games a lot as a kid. Don't play now. No time. Little interest.

10054	agent_1:Have you seen the movie Solaris? agent_2:No.  Do you know anything more about it? agent_1:I just think the theme is fascinating ... the tension arising from floating around a planet, but never landing.  Have you felt that way in life? agent_2:No.  I did learn lately that our planet is also called Gaia. agent_1:Oh, I mean, where you're constantly in flux and you see everyone else with concrete life happening and making progress ... and you're not. agent_2:I read about a planet that orbits 4 stars.  Perhaps that would parallel the concept you are discussing.  The direction would be hard to determine. agent_1:Interesting.  I've heard of dual-stars, but this is four?  Normally planets just have the one star, so that would be extraordinary. agent_2:Clearly the universe is amazing.  Early humans could study it some since 5 planets are visible to the naked eye. agent_1:I don't think I could tell the difference between them.  But just imagine having the time and attention to discern that there are five different ones, all without photography! agent_2:No doubt!  Previous generations were intelligent too.  As long ago as 1975, the Soviets sent a spacecraft to Venus and mankind saw pictures of the surface.	agent_1:I'd say they were smarter.  I think the current generation only feels smart because we've got all this technology and knowledge at our fingertips.  So then, we feel like we can fill all our time with comedy.	agent_2 dislikes TV shows. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV shows', 'movie', 'movie title'].

Is it live action or not? agent_1:I was a big Lion King fan, have you seen it?	agent_2:No they haven't come out with the Remake yet.

440	agent_1:Do you like rap music? agent_2:I do, but I cannot tolerate Kanye West. I adore Tupac, and think it's interesting that the Library of Congress chose his music to be included because it's culturally significant. agent_1:I agree, Kanye's old music was really good. He's just out there. Just like how he thinks AIDS is a man-made disease.  agent_2:I just don't care for him. I would have loved to have been in the courtroom, the day a judge decided to give her ruling to Eminem, in rap style. agent_1:That would have been funny. Speaking of Eminem, did you know that his true dream was to become a comic book artist? agent_2:Yes, Spidey is his favorite. My brother used to love Rugrats when he was little, I only found out recently, that Busta Rhymes voiced the reptar wagon in the movie. agent_1:I didn't know that either. That's pretty interesting. Did you know that Korean rappers invented a new type of freestyle?	agent_2:The compliment battle, lol. i would love to hear that.

Did you know women are more likely to own one than men? agent_2:I wonder why though. Have you heard of the game Send me to heaven? agent_1:I have , that is the game where people throw their phones as high as they can agent_2:Yeah and that is why Apple had to get in between and ban the game. Pretty stupid one agent_1:Yeah agree. When the iPhone came out Jobs has to have identical ones with him as they kept crashing during the reveal agent_2:Yeah that is pretty cool. Microsoft held a funeral for the iPhone when they revealed theirs	agent_1:Yeah that did not go very well because the iPhone sales have sky rocketed	agent_2 likes technology. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['technology', 'video games', 'game name'].
4255	agent_1:Do you listen to Mariah Carey?  agent_2:I do, I have been a fan of the All I want for Christmas is You.   agent_1:That was a good album. I'm not sure if she has released anything recently though. agent_2:I dont know either, she does have an incredible vocal range though.  No other singer really has matched her there. agent_1:Do you think she will go on tour soon?  agent_2:I'm not sure, but I know Glitter has gone to the top of the charts recently agent_1:Is that her new album? I wonder if it is doing better than Linkin Parks Hybrid theory. agent_2:It is one of hers, but not better than Linkin Park's that was the best selling album of all time. agent_1:Apparently, NWA's album was the first to reach platinum status without the support of airplay.  agent_2:That is pretty incredible, now musicians have it much easier as distribution of music is easier, you dont have to go to the store to buy things anymore. agent_1:Yeah, with Youtube and things like that. Do you own any snakes?  agent_2:Nope.  Im like New Zeland, no snakes.  But I do have some friends who own them. agent_1:Interesting, I didn't know there were no snakes in new Zealand. 	agent_2:Im now sure why, maybe all the other animals ate them or something.  Have you heard of those flying snakes that can launch themselves at their prey?  That would be totally creepy	agent_1 likes animals. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['animals', 'music', 'music distribution'].

He won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship in 1958. agent_1:I guess he had a tremendous sense of rhythm too. I would love to see footage of him dancing. agent_2:It was before youtube.  Probably, you cannot find it online. agent_1:Yeah, that is too bad. he was probably a real ladies man too. Tupac was also a great dancer. agent_2:A ballet dancer!  He was the mouse king in his high school production of the Nutcracker. agent_1:I would love to see video of that too. he was a backup dancer for digital underground too. agent_2:That was interesting.  If I were not self conscious, I might be able to dance just like what babies do when they hear music. agent_1:I probably could not dance as a baby even. It feels like work to me.  agent_2:I understand.  Do you know that professional ballet dancers can go through four pairs of pointe shoes in a week? agent_1:If i did it, it would be a dozen pairs. or forty. LOL i would probably bust the floor too  agent_2:Talking about babies earlier, apparently, babies will dance spontaneously when they hear music and smile more when they hit the beat. agent_1:Yeah, i believe it. I wonder if i was like that. i think i wasnt.  agent_2:Perhaps you can ask your parents.  agent_1:I guess i could. Anyway, great chat! agent_2:It was nice chatting with you too! agent_1:Have a good weekend!	agent_2:Perhaps I will learn how to dance this weekend at the community center.

Some of them can be cool though, like that poem that when read normally is depressing and vice versa agent_2:there is a 274 line poem called the chaos, i am assuming becaus it has irregularly pronounced words agent_1:I would assume so too. THe Javanese alphabet too, if recited in order it forms a poem agent_2:the vikings were warrior poets. lol what the heck? did they just shout poetry at the enemy ? agent_1:Hahaha maybe that is how they fought. Allan Poe received only $9 for his poem The Raven. Not is is priceless agent_2:isn't that always the way? things don't become priceless until the person is dead. baltimore must be the place for poetry! first edgar allen poe and also tupac  agent_1:Yeah it seems that way.

I had no idea! agent_2:I know California is a major wine region, I guess the entire West Coast is a good place to have vineyards. agent_1:Yeah. I really want to do a vineyard tour in Napa. Have you ever been? agent_2:No I have not. I will be traveling to Portland this year so I may have to see these Oregon vineyards firsthand now. agent_1:Nice. My sister loves a vineyard in Oregon. I cannot remember the name though. She got pretty drunk on it and spent like $500 on a few cases. agent_2:I'll have to watch how much wine I have, I don't know if I have enough space in my luggage to bring a few cases home. agent_1:No, she had them mailed to her house! We have different priorities... I do not mind wine in a box. She has ""standards"". Ha! agent_2:I believe a lot more wineries are using the box delivery method. I think it saves them money and helps keep the wine fresher. agent_1:I think so too. Do you enjoy star wars? agent_2:Yes I've watched all the movies. I'm probably not as big a fan as a lot of people. How about you? agent_1:I do like them but am not a huge fan. I thought I knew a lot but then got humbled by a true fan. They take that stuff really seriously! agent_2:Yes they do, I have heard a lot of them reference stories from outside the movies. I did not know there was so much lore in that universe. agent_1:I had no idea the original lightsaber is in the international space station. Wow... agent_2:That's really cool, I wonder if any of the astronauts have taken it out to pretend to be Luke Skywalker."	agent_1:I would!

And with all that technology, Google built their first computer with the housing being made out of legos. agent_1:Computers can be made of anything. Russians made a computer that ran on water and someone built a working 16bit computer using nothing but basic minecraft building blocks! agent_2:Yep... and Disney definitely takes advantage of the computer making CGI movies agent_1:Indeed. Hollywood too have been remaking beloved classics with new CGI technology and overall better technology thanks to computers agent_2:and we definitely benefit from it all as consumers!	agent_1:I am looking forward to the disney lion king's remake of the 1994 classic	agent_2 likes movie. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'TV show', 'movie company'].

The Thin Silence? i havent heard of it. agent_1:Yes apparently it's being developed by Two PM Studios, it sounds really crazy it uses the look of videogames from the 80's agent_2:What? the 80s? like NES and stuff?  Why? seems odd. agent_1:Yes I think so! Do you play any video games by the way? agent_2:i used to play a long long time ago. havent played recently. the systems look cool, but i dont have the time LOL agent_1:Yeah I hear you on that haha. It's funny that initially video games were called ""cathode ray tube Amusement devices""LOL that sucks all the fun out of them agent_2:That is a totally military name. too many words, too official sounding. pointless. agent_1:Have you ever visited South Korea? Apparently if you're under 16 it's illegal for you to play video games after midnight haha agent_2:I think that there is a video game craze there. plus there are games cafes that are open all night  agent_1:That sounds pretty cool. Did you ever play a video game based on Toy Story? Apparently Tom Hanks his brother, Jim Hanks, does all of the voices for Woody in the video games agent_2:that's great. Tom has enough money, and his brother could use the work. how would you like to be his brother? That would be tough, overshadowed by Tom agent_1:It would be tough but you're still making a lot of money haha. Have you ever played the Harry Potter video games or even LittleBigPlanet? Apparently this guy Stephen Fry does the narration in those games, I bet he also makes a lot of money agent_2:I have not.

Yourself?  agent_2:Similar regarding the dog. I was talking to my roommate about MLS Soccer.  agent_1:I like Orlando City, personally. I have a good friend who used to play for Manchester United.  agent_2:Really? I bet that was wild.  I didn't think I'd ever need to know much about it myself. We were actually talking about Wayne Rooney a little bit ago.  agent_1:Do you have any thoughts about where Wayne Rooney will end up next year?  agent_2:No thoughts but I've heard talk. Atlanta has gone nuts for MLS the last couple of years. We won the Cup this year and now when you walk into a bar you hear guys speculating about Rooney to DC United next year.   agent_1:Orlando has embraced MLS too, I am quite surprised how popular it has become.  	agent_2:I'm with you 110% on that. I haven't heard anyone talk about how embarrassing the Falcons are in weeks.  It makes sense. We haven't ever really had a winner before.

That surprises me, I thought it would be about equal. Iphone's have 75 elements in them. agent_1:75??? Huh... I feel like iphones are older than 12 years. They came out in 2007? agent_2:I did too. Did you know Apple's app store has 2.2 million applications available? agent_1:That's a ton! I wonder how many are actually active as in kept up or updated?

I heard alot of those guys don't want their kids on the phones and ipads.  agent_1:I dont either and I am pretty sure I am addicted to the dopamine hit I get everytime I open my phone. agent_2:True, Do you listen to Pandora?  I see they have a cap on how much you can listen for free. agent_1:I do not any more. I hit that cap and then switched to spotify where I pay for the premium service. Do you like pandora? agent_2:I too use spotify! I like it better. Did you know that the NFL is legally considered entertainment than a sport like the WWE. agent_1:Really. I had no idea.

Have you? agent_1:No I saw the original one but I didn't see the newest one, my friend side and said it was really bad so I wanted to see your opinion agent_2:Ok, I do like SOME horror, but I usually pick and choose. I liked The Shining, The Omen, The Exorcist. Rosemary's Baby. What about you? agent_1:Yeah those are all good movies. I also liked Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street. The new Halloween note took in about $89 in only 3 days, so it was definitely popular agent_2:I haven't seen those. I think that remakes are risky. The comparisons are inevitable. agent_1:Yep it's always hard to beat the original. And yes the new Halloween movie is actually being released on the 40th anniversary of the release of the first one agent_2:I would rather watch the original. It probably has charm. The new one is probably too slick.  agent_1:Yeah I think the original is going to be the best. Did you know that Stephen King actually thinks that the movie Bambi should be a horror movie? agent_2:He was traumatized as a child. That movie did have death, so it could be scary. Anyway, he turned his trauma into a career. agent_1:Well that's really good for him! Do you think that horror movies actually burn almost 200 calories per movie? If so I should watch more to lose weight LOL agent_2:I wonder if the effect wears off. No surprise, no tension. I would rather exercise. By the way, do you like horses? agent_1:No I don't like horses I'm actually allergic to them LOL and apparently so is Clint Eastwood agent_2:I have never ridden a horse. I would like to. Is it hard? I figure you have to take lessons or something. agent_1:Yeah you do have to learn, it's actually very uncomfortable even in a saddle, I think it's cool that Dalmatians were used with firehouses in order to calm the horses back before fire trucks	agent_2:I've heard that the dogs were deaf.

Do you know anything about Henry David Thoreau? agent_1:I know a bit about him, he is a environmentalist I believe, right? agent_2:Yes, but he was also an author.    Lots of others were inspired by his example. agent_1:I get his point though, I mean 80% of the earth's forests have been destroyed already agent_2:Speaking of the earth, how old is the planet? agent_1:As far as I know, I think about 4.5 billion years ago agent_2:That is a long time ago.    How much of the surface of the planet is water? agent_1:I believe it is about 71%, I was always told 3/4ths when I was younger agent_2:That makes sense.     Do you know what the core is made from? agent_1:It is essentially iron and heat, so hot most of it is liquid, and that is what causes volcano eruptions agent_2:Interesting.     Did you know the earth is quite a bit more dense than the sun!	agent_1:I did not know that actually, but I guess it kinda makes sense since the sun is mostly gas	agent_2 dislikes weather. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['weather', 'hobby', 'activity'].
404	agent_1:Do you like wearing hats? It has so many functions! agent_2:I don't like them on myself but I know a lot of people that can pull them off.  agent_1:Yes me as well. In the military hats denote a nationality, branch of service, rank or regiment. agent_2:I noticed the different hats in the military but did not know it had to do with rank.  agent_1:Yes they have a function to play. In the old west, the most popular hat was the bowler! agent_2:Wow! They always show a stetson or something close so I'm shocked by that.  agent_1:Yes me as well! Tipping of ones hat arises from the knights raising their face visors. Very chivalry of them! agent_2:That's a very interesting fact. Did you know that until 1998 British politicians were required to wear a top hat if they were making a point of order? agent_1:Oh wow that seems kind of an old tradition. Kind of like that conical party hat which was derived from dunce caps! agent_2:That's also a strange hat. As far as old traditions in British politics I don't understand why they still wear powdered wigs in court either. So strange.  agent_1:Agreed. They look so silly in my opinion. A lot of rapping attire looks silly too. But the rapper Tupac was very talented as his music is in the library of congress of cultural significance.	agent_2:I'm surprised they would include any rap at this point to be honest.

No kids here, but what is Cupcake and Dino? agent_2:Apparently it is a kids show, but I've never seen it. Maybe it is a movie.  agent_1:Have you seen the Christopher Robin film?  I was wondering how it was. agent_2:No, I didn't. It sounds like it could have been good Ewan McGregor is a pretty good actor.  agent_1:Yes, he is.  I didn't go see it, because I thought people would look at me strange seeing a ""kids"" movie.  But I always liked Winnie the Pooh, as a child. agent_2:It was a good show. Did you know Christopher Robin was a real boy?  agent_1:I heard that he was the author's son in real life.  That's so cool, talk about having a book written about you. agent_2:I don't know if I could handle that to be honest. agent_1:Me either. Lol The New York public library is the home of the real Winnie the pooh toy teddy bear.  I saw it once on a school trip, it looked old and raggedy. agent_2:I didn't know that. So they still have it?  agent_1:Yes, they do. It's hard to believe that toy bear hasn't fallen apart, yet. It's like WW I era, that's old.  agent_2:That's pretty cool. I wonder if they offer the movie on Netflix?  agent_1:They probably do, I'm going to look for it and watch it, if they do. agent_2:Apparently netflix and youtube make up half of peak internet traffic in north america.  agent_1:That I can totally see.  And the other half is on Facebook.. lol agent_2:I believe it, although you have to wonder how much of that is actually instagram? "	agent_1:How true.  I heard that Blockbuster had several chances to buy Netflix and didn't.

11057	"agent_1:Hi there did you know that the US Senate used the same gavel for 165 years? agent_2:I think I heard about that! And then one day Richard Nixon broke it LOL he truly is the master in the art of ruining things LOL agent_1:To Funny! Apparently the Senate set up a rule that the Sargent of Arms could round up missing members and carry them into the Senate chamber.  agent_2:Wow that's interesting. You know what I want to do though? I want to raid the candy desk that's in the Senate, they have a lot of good stuff like milky Way's and Mars Bars and jelly beans lol those are my favorite agent_1:Right, haha! It's a shame that women weren't allowed to wear pants on the Senate floor. At least not until 1993, wow! agent_2:That is insane! I'm glad that they fix that because that seems really silly, also I like Michael Jordan's quote. he says that he won't endorse a Democratic candidate because""Republicans buy shoes to""I wish more celebrities would follow in his footsteps agent_1:That's some kind of sentiment, kind of confusing, why not just say he's a Republican, lol! agent_2:Haha that's true. How often do you vote by the way? Did you know that astronauts vote from space? agent_1:Wow that's pretty cool. The indian Government set up a polling booth in the forest, it was full of lions. agent_2:Well that's cool. And they did that all for just a single voter too! Did you know that in the United Kingdom, not every man could vote until 1918, that's not a long time ago agent_1:Wow i didn't know that. Also a shame that 34% of black males have been permanently unable to vote in Alabama.  agent_2:I agree that is sad. What makes me laugh though, is that the citizens in Texas voted to rename a garbage dump in Austin to""Fred Durst""that's definitely a diss on him haha agent_1:Yeah it is. You know there hasn't been a US president who wasn't a republican or Dem since the mid 1800's. agent_2:No I didn't know that. I think it would be interesting to have more political parties in the United States though. Another interesting thing, is that every president with a beard has been a republican, I wonder why that is haha agent_1:Wow no republican has been elected with out a bush or Nixon on the ticket since 1928. That sounds oddly weird to me. "	agent_2:That is really weird. Although I think that information is old, because Trump was elected and he's a Republican. What is really crazy to me, is that the red and blue colors for Republicans Democrats only started in the year 2000. That seems like it's been that way my whole life, but apparently not	agent_1 dislikes politics. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'work', 'history'].
2812	agent_1:Are you familiar with Native American books? agent_2:I read a few in school.  I was raised in Oklahoma and many of my friends were of the Cherokee and Choctaw tribes.  I have heard of Tommy Orange's fiction novel about Native Americans. agent_1:That's interesting!  He is a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes.  I don't know much about those two tribes.  His book is about a boy? agent_2:Yes.  It is fiction however.  It provides insight into the challenges that the boy has in grappling with his identity.  We have a national history where many atrocities and slurs dot the history. agent_1:True!  I went to an indian reservation this past summer in New York.  It was the Seneca nation and I went through one of their museums.  They pretty much got kicked out of their land just like all the other tribes in the nation. agent_2:A people divided into tribes cannot stand against a unified enemy.  But, my wife's best friend has a Ph.D. and the government paid for all of her education because she is Cherokee.  But if one knows the facts, a lot of interesting history can be written. agent_1:Wow.  That's really interesting.  Hopefully Tommy Orange's book does well.   agent_2:Books can be fiction with a lot of facts or not so many.  Wiki has an article where they rank fictional characters according to their powers. agent_1:Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction in his youth.  Never knew that he did that before. agent_2:I wonder how one would find a copy of it.  Imagine Edgar Allen Poe wrote about a cyborg a long time ago agent_1:Interesting!  A judget ried to ban a science fiction comic in the 1950's because it featured a black character.  agent_2:Wow!  We have come a long way, thank goodness.  The FDA also burned 6 tons of literature in an act of censorship. agent_1:I think I remember reading about that before.  Literature was an olympic event from 1912 to 1952.  I would like to see one of those gold medals.	"agent_2:I would like to understand the scoring.  I bet it was somewhat like Jeopardy.

5025	agent_1:Hi there! How's it going? Are you a baseball fan? agent_2:Hi. I'm doing very well thanks. I'm do watch baseball on occasion and I'm a casual fan. agent_1:Do you root for a specific team? Long-time Yankee fan over here. agent_2:You probably won't like this but I'm Red Sox fan. I heard that Eric Hosmer signed with the San Diego Padres  for $144 million in an eight year contract. agent_1:Haha you're right I don't like the Red Sox. Yes I believe the Hosmer contract was last year. I think that's going to end up being a bad contract. agent_2:Me too. I think its too much money for a player that has proven himself. He is a 28 years old and he plays in the first base position and he did very well as a Royal. agent_1:By the end of that deal he will be in his mid to late 30's and nowhere ear as good. Definitely an overpay. Not as crazy as those Machado and Harper deals for over 300 million though. agent_2:No nothing like that. He has won 4 Gold Gloves in his career and I will like to see him in a Red Sox uniform. agent_1:That's true the Red Sox only weakness now is 1st base. Who's their starting, Mitch Moreland? agent_2:You are correct. I also heard that Hosmer will be making $20 million over each of the first 5 seasons with the Padres. agent_1:That's smart to front load it. It's crazy how much these guys get to play baseball. It's not even as physically demanding as football, basketball or hockey. agent_2:I agree with you completely. Those sports are way more physical than baseball. Did you know that the Dodgers have lost more world series championships than any other baseball team? agent_1:They've been around so long, it makes sense. I think they lost a lot of them to the Yankees. It's funny prior to the cubs just winning recently the last time they won before that the Ottoman Empire still existed. agent_2:Ha Ha!! The Dodgers are bad. They were crushed by the Red Sox agent_1:I hate how good Mookie Betts is. I think the Yankee's will give the Red Sox a run for their money this year though. agent_2:I believe that to be the case. The Yankees are very talented club and always gave a hard time to the Red Sox whether we played them here or at Yankees. agent_1:Have you been to Fenway Park? I actually saw a game there on a trip to Boston. It's a really cool stadium. agent_2:I have been to Fenway Park a few times and its really nice and especially when we play against the Yankees. I think the Padres will be fine because their ownership is investing . agent_1:Well I don't know if you heard, but the Padres did just sign Manny Machado this year. I think his contract was like 300 million for 10 years. agent_2:You're correct. They are building the team and I think they will do well in the long term but as far as them making it to the World Series, I'm not too sure about that.	agent_1:I don't think they have the pitching yet. That's so important for winning the World Series.

I wonder why. agent_2:Im not sure, they probably werent the ones downloading that game send me to heaven and launching them into the air. agent_1:Ha ha maybe. Have you heard of the band Muse? agent_2:Cant say that I have, what do they do?	agent_1:Kind of pop rock.

10108	agent_1:Hello how are you today? agent_2:Hello, I am good. How are you?  Do you listen to jazz music? agent_1:I like all music. Did you know jazz originated in the African American communities of New Orleans in the late 19th and early 20 century. agent_2:i think I did know that.  Seems like I've seen a movie that referenced it.  Didn't they combine jazz with some brass band marches or something? agent_1:It has roots in blues and ragtime.  It is now recognized as a major form of musical expression. agent_2:I'm glad.  It's world wide now too.  Pakistan has a jazz orchestra! agent_1:Cool jazz actually originated in the 1940s. It introduced calmer smoother sounds and long linear melodic lines you hear in todays jazz. agent_2:i like that. There's a lot of good music from the 40s. agent_1:Were you aware that Clint Eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast. agent_2:No I wasn't.  i guess going by the characters he plays in movies I just never made the connection. agent_1:Oh he is a big fan. He even scored several films including million dollar baby. That is a great movie. agent_2:He did?  What instrument does he play? agent_1:I think he played a few different instruments. There is a woman in Harlem who has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every Sunday or over 20 years. agent_2:That's cool. I bet she's pretty good to last that long. agent_1:She occasionally has top performers stop by. I wonder if Clint has ever checked it out. agent_2:You never know.  He's a top performer if he can do a movie score.   agent_1:I just figured it would be something that would interest him. Did you know jazz trumpeters grow out their goatees because it provides comfort while playing their instrument.	agent_2:No lol!

12978	"agent_1:Hello,  do you know much about fish?   agent_2:I know a little about fish I think they are interesting. I know that black swallower fish can eat prey twice its own length and ten times its weight. I am very impressed with that fact.  agent_1:That is pretty amazing!  I don't think I could eat that much,  but sometimes it feels like I do!  did you know there a breed of jelly fish and lobster that is immortal.  Of course its only immortal if no one kills it lol but it literally can live forever! agent_2:I actually have heard that before and wondered why we are not studying jellyfish more to find out how and why that is possible. Could we use that to our benefit in any way I wonder?  agent_1:I do not know,  I just seen it on Blue Planet on Netflix lol maybe their organs do not age after a certain poing lol  agent_2:Maybe. I would really like them to find out more about that. Did you know that a seahorse is the only fish with a neck? agent_1:Yeah that is interesting!  Some fish look like they have necks though lol so they have necks and can carry a baby good for them.  agent_2:Yes some do but only the seahorse truly does. Freshwater fish only ""drink"" water through their skin via osmosis, while saltwater fish also drink water through their mouths. I wonder how evolution made that chnage in the two? agent_1:Yeah you would think drinking salty water through your mouth would taste bad lol  agent_2:For us I'm sure it would. I wonder how their sense of taste differs? The last fish fact I have is that 84 per cent of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish. agent_1:Oh wow,  I dont even know that fish,  I hope it looks like a Zebra!  Do you like Jazz? agent_2:I'm not a big fan but I certainly appreciate the genre and the performers.  agent_1:It looks like clint eastwood is a jazz fan.  I wouldve thought country lol  agent_2:That is surprising. I know he is a big fan of music because he has scored several films  including Million Dollar Baby. agent_1:That movie was so sad.  Did you know Pakistan has a jazz orchestra? agent_2:It was. No I was not aware of that. I wonder what that is like? I did know that a Harlem woman has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every sunday for 20 years. top performers occasionally stop by. agent_1:Wow that is smart,  also she keeps all the money instead of giving money to a venue lol awesome.  agent_2:Very good business model. I heard that is a programming language in which the programs are written in musical composition, and functional programs have jazz-like harmonies. agent_1:I hear jazz trumpeters grow goatees for comfort! agent_2:I guess the instrument would irritate your face over a long time period.

Apparently there is a lizard with no legs and i always though that was what a snake was, lol.  agent_2:really? I wonder what separates the two from each other then, i have to imagine they look very similar agent_1:You would think but that's not what they pay me for, ha. Maybe we should move to new zealand they don't have snakes there. agent_2:i agree, snakes are so creepy, they are a very lucky country in my opinion agent_1:Mine too. Apparently fear of snakes is hard wired into our brains and monkeys. agent_2:maybe it is because of the way that they move or the noises that they make? I cannot think of why that may be the case agent_1:Me either. Do you know who Taylor Swift is?  agent_2:I do, I am a big fan of her music! agent_1:she was born on December 13 1989. one of her albums won 4 grammy's.  agent_2:she is very successful, she also owns a private jet, she is doing very well for herself agent_1:Yes she is and to be so young it's great! that jet is a Falcon 900 and cost 40 million right? Those are really nice. agent_2:yes, that is more than I will see in my lifetime, but I am glad she was able to make so much in her career before she loses popularity agent_1:Well hopefully she did well with the money she made so far because fame don't last forever.  agent_2:that is true, she knows her stuff, she took her music off spotify so it was not free, she is kind of money minded agent_1:Well that's good.

I saw video games were originally called cathode ray tube amusement devices. agent_1:Say that ten times fast haha.

Do you have a playstation or xbox? agent_2:I have a PS4. What about you? agent_1:I have an xbox. I wonder when the playstation came out? agent_2:I love Sony so I've always stuck with Playstation. agent_1:I had the playstation and playstation 2 but then jumped to xbox. I think it's cool the military uses playstation 3's to build a supercomputer. agent_2:That is very cool.

The UN appointed ambassadors to extraterrestrials.  agent_1:Yes,  definitely.  Thats cool lol at least they are prepared!  Do you believe in aliens? agent_2:I am not sure.

Are you knowledgeable of the sport known as baseball? agent_2:Yeah, I used to play when I was younger. Did you know a 17 year old female pitcher was banned from professional baseball after she struck out babe ruth?  agent_1:That sounds unfair! She should have been hired on the spot! fans would pay to see that! agent_2:Hilarious, did you know the opposing team receives three bases if a player catches a baseball in their hat?  agent_1:How often does that happen? Has an umpire ever really done that? I have questions. agent_2:I'm not sure, it doesn't seem like a real rule does it?  agent_1:It sounds bogus. Three bases? I've never heard of that. Somebody check the rule book! Giamatti would not accept that rule. agent_2:Yeah, some of the stuff you read isn't always true. Did you know that the Chicago Cubs were the first baseball team to win Back To Back World Series.  agent_1:The Cubbies, a sad story. How could they put on such a losing streak? They signed a deal with the devil to win back to back, and then never win again. agent_2:Well they won recently didn't they? I think in 2014 or maybe it was 16, it slips my memory.  agent_1:Did they? Did they break the curse? I didn't know that. I figured they had made their deal, but now I guess they made a new deal with the devil. Why do managers wear uniforms now? agent_2:I believe they did.

I love reading articles about that part of the world, though. Like, did you read about the missile alert in Hawaii? agent_1:Yes, I remember when that happened. The entire state thought they were being attacked by North Korea. agent_2:I bet he won't shoot a missile! agent_1:I don't put anything past him. Even though we don't know how old he is, he is very intelligent and knows his way around arms. agent_2:You're right about that. He may not make the rational decisions you might expect from other leaders. agent_1:He does have a degree in physics, that alone makes him dangerous, when you factor in all the military equipment he has to play with. agent_2:In addition to the physics degree, he received one as at a military university. Plus, since his father and grandfather were leaders, you might assume that he has been aware of military and political strategies from a very young age, don't you think? agent_1:I don't know. DPK is such a secretive country. Supposedly, he learned how to drive at 3. agent_2:At 3?! I wonder if he missed out on his childhood experiences, and that is why he is spending so much money on renovating theme parks in North Korea? agent_1:I honestly don't know much about the country, or him. I'm still marveling that trump met with him. agent_2:Indeed! I truly didn't think that 2018 would see a US President visit with the North Korean leader, or that  the North Korean leader would visit South Korea for the first time since the end of the Korean War. What a strange year. agent_1:In Hawaii, the official business shirt is an aloha shirt. Much better look than a suit and tie, in the tropics, have you been? agent_2:Is that right? I didn't know that. I have never visited Hawaii yet. I hope to go some day. It would take a long time though. Did you know air travel is actually slower now than in the 1960's to save on fuel costs? agent_1:I didn't know that. I know that Japan is crazy expensive to travel, as they have mainly toll roads. agent_2:I didn't know about the toll roads. I visited Japan and only took trains. there is a website for people that will let you crash on their couch while you're traveling. That can help make it less expensive. agent_1:I wouldn't want people crashing on mine, or be comfortable crashing. It's weird that there aren't that many cars in Iceland. Or buses. agent_2:Why do you think that is so? Is it because people travel by train or boat?	agent_1:I think it's because it is a small country.

My favorite of all time is Deadpool though. agent_1:Oh, I love that character! But surprisingly even with how not good it was, Wonder Woman managed to be the highest grossing superhero movie! agent_2:Wow, even higher than all the Batmans? agent_1:Yes, and it's even considered a WWI movie, I wonder why though. Perhaps its because the actress, Gal Gadot, served two years as a soldier in the Israel Defense Forces? agent_2:That is cool that she served.  She seems to be a good role model for young girls. agent_1:She really does. It's not a superhero thing, but Earth will be helium-free by the end of the 21st century, I wonder what kind of impact that would bring, do you know? agent_2:I am not sure, it is probably something I should know.  Humans have done a lot of damage to the planet. agent_1:Yeah I agree, especially when the FDA burns through six tons of literature in an act of US censorhip agent_2:That is so wasteful.  Did you know winston chruchills prize was in Literature, not peace? agent_1:Oh really? Did he publish something to warrant the prize? agent_2:I think he did.  Dont know what though. agent_1:There's an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with worst possible opening sentences to novels, I wonder why, any guesses? agent_2:I think there is a contest for that.

Or maybe he has a secret helium source. agent_1:As long as he is not jumping on the couches in his bunker, I am fine with it. He seems a little weird... agent_2:Speaking of weird, the world's longest name is a story about a shepherd protecting his sheep and humanity from aliens. Who has this name, and why? Are the parents X-files fans?"	agent_1:Aliens were based of creatures found in the ocean? I feel like there is a lot in the ocean we do not know about.	agent_2 dislikes aliens. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['aliens', 'TV show', 'TV show'].
3164	agent_1:Hi there. Do you like to play video games? agent_2:I used to play them when I was younger. I was never good at Tetris though even though it is one of three best selling video games of all.  agent_1:I was into Tetris for a while. My mom got addicted to it and stole my Gameboy a lot. I wonder if she started seeing tetris blocks in her sleep. That happens to some people who play tetris for an extended period of time. agent_2:That is so weird! As an adult I wish i was good at Tetris when I quit smoking or trying to diet because it can offer a quick fix when people are struggling to stick to working on either. agent_1:Yeah, and they also will regularly identify tetromino shapes in real life like in patterns on buldings or in layouts of boxes. Haha, hilarous. agent_2:Okay, well then maybe I'm not so sad that I am not good at it. I would not want to deal with that. agent_1:Right? Haha. I didn't know that Tetris was actually from the Soviet Union. I thought it was just part of the Tetris design where there were Russian buildings. agent_2:Yes, Alexey Pajitinov was the original designer and programmer. agent_1:You mentioned that Tetris can help with addictions. Well it can also help with PTSD. So if you can deal with seeing Tetris shapes everywhere it might be a good option for PTSD. agent_2:Oh! I'm glad you're still here. I thought you were gone. Well, that is great for PTSD sufferers.  agent_1:No, it just takes me a while to think of what to say. Do you ever play dance video games? agent_2:No, but I enjoy dance performances. Did you know Tupac was a ballet dancer?	agent_1:That is neat. Speaking of ballet dancers, they can go through four pairs of pointe shoes a week. Sounds painful and expensive!	agent_2 likes entertainment. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['entertainment', 'video games', 'video games'].
9238	agent_1:Did you know the taller candidate has won the US Election 75% of the time?  agent_2:I had heard that.  It is an interesting metric to think about when it comes to elections.  I wonder if that accounts for popular vote, or just the election. agent_1:I'm not sure, good question. There are 3 subways lines exclusively for congressmen though! agent_2:That is kind of crazy.  Did you know Elmo testified before congress? agent_1:No, was it a joke or for real?  agent_2:Im not totally sure, but I know he is the only non-human to do so.  Maybe Oscar the grouch was causing some problems down in the hood or something.  lol agent_1:LOL, I wonder what actor played him?  agent_2:I dont know, I always just imagine a stuffed toy or something.  The Congress always plays a Rep vs Dem game of baseball each year. agent_1:Yeah, that is fairly common. It must be a very boring game to watch though. 	agent_2:I agree.  I imagine they can't be any good, which could make it funny, but in a very sad sense.	agent_1 likes TV shows. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV shows', 'movie', 'actor'].
5857	"agent_1:Did you ever think about how celebrities in science are rarer than in music, film, sport, and politics? agent_2:No I never thought of that.  Were you a fan of Stephen Hawking? agent_1:I think that it was amazing how he was almost completely paralyzed and could accomplish so much. agent_2:Yes, I agree, he was brilliant as well.  He was the ultimate example of mind over matter.  agent_1:He was one of the first people to apply quantum physics to black holes and make predictions  with a process named after him as ""Hawking radiation"" agent_2:Yeah his understanding and explaining of quantum physics and other matter is incredible.  agent_1:I don't really understand what he understood because it seems so foreign to me, but he also had a lot of wit as well to share with the world. agent_2:Yeah I am the same, it is very complex stuff. There are scientists who theorize that universes evolve through natural selection like species do here.  agent_1:Hawking was very active up until the end of life even travelling and lecturing internationally.  I have to give credit as well to his supporters agent_2:Yeah I agree with you there.  I guess there is a radical theory that there is only one electron in the universe! I'm sure Hawking would have disagreed.  agent_1:Probably.  Also, there is a region of space maybe pulling galaxies outside the observable universe.  There must be so much out there. agent_2:Wow, yeah it is wild to think about the universe as a whole in general.  agent_1:Strange but there are some stars that are cold enough that they can be touched by a human hand agent_2:That is a strange fact, very cool.  Did you know that Kim jong-un has a degree in physics? agent_1:Not sure who that is, but I wonder if Hawkings would validate the tidbit that the universe could have come from nothing without violating physics? agent_2:I'm not sure that is an interesting thought and he is the leader of North Korea.  agent_1:Oh wow!  Robin Williams in aladdin was the first actor to start the trend of celebrity voicings of animated film characters."	agent_2:I didn't know that.

2217	agent_1:hi how are you doing over there on that side of the internets agent_2:Hi! Hope you're doing well! So are you a fan of The Walt Disney Company? One of my favorite characters is Minnie Mouse and I was surprised to recently find out her name is short for Minerva Mouse! agent_1:i like disney though i havent watched a disney film in a while. i do like minnie. she is cute as the dickens. agent_2:Well there's actually a hidden subculture dedicated to finding hidden Mickey mouse images in all things Disney, you should definitely check out! agent_1:i guess if you find a mickey, you win something? if i find one, i guess i should tell others and not keep it secret. agent_2:That's a good point! Ha! Unless they change the locations up!  Are you also a fan of Bill Nye? He actually served as a science consultant on Flubber, believe it or not! agent_1:i guess he knows a bit about the science of hypothetical substances. he is an entertaining fellow for sure. agent_2:Indeed he is! I also think it's amazing that Big Hero 6 was rendered with a 55,000 core supercomputer. That is amazing! agent_1:that is astonishing. i wonder how many processors theyll need for big hero 7. i dint see the other big hero movies. agent_2:Probably a lot more than 55,000. Ha! Did you ever see Wall-E? If so, the name is actually a tip of the hat to Walter Elias Disney himself! agent_1:that is cute. i wondered why they pickt such a strange name for a robot but now i see. but he dint have a mustache. agent_2:You're right, I don't think he did! Ha! I'd like to see Wall-E with factual hair like Kanye West's. I bet that'd be funny. Speaking of Kanye, you know he believes aids is man made?  agent_1:yes Kanye is an oddball when it comes to science.  agent_2:That is true. But he does do cool stuff every now again like the time he gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair at one of his concerts. That was nice of him! agent_1:i think that he undersatnds entertainment good but he doesnt have the knowledge for science.  agent_2:True. I loved how he did an SNL skit where he mocked himself interrupting award shows ironically two years before he interrupted Taylor Swift at an award show. Ha! agent_1:he knew the depths of his depravity and told the whole world first. i think that is honest of him  agent_2:Agreed. Since we're on the subject of rap, are you a fan of Tupac. I'm so glad his music is in the library of Congress of cultural significance. He was a talented musician!	agent_1:Tupac is not my cup of tea but the man could rap the street an urban lullaby.

Some dogs in Moscow have learned to use the subway! agent_1:Well those dogs are definitely smarter than me lol. Dogs aren't color blind either, just don't see the same thing we see! agent_2:I wonder why they always have said they are? lol  I always find it amusing how a dog drinks with the underside of their tongue. agent_1:That is so cool. Dogs are so smart for sure! Dogs and elephants are the only animals that understand pointing. agent_2:Cool!  Russia has a tomb of the unknown dog as a memorial for canine research subjects.  Kind of sad. agent_1:It really is. I just love dogs haha. Did you know in Hawaii the office attire of choice is the aloha shirt? Talk about comfy! agent_2:Nice!  Sign me up!  lol  At Billy Mays funeral the pallbearers wore blue shorts and khaki pants.  Kind of casual and different. agent_1:RIP Billy Mays! I like how polo shirts were originally invited for tennis players. agent_2:I didn't know that!  I know the tshirt was invented in 1904 and was marketed to bachelors who couldn't sew or replace buttons. agent_1:That would be the market I would have been in back then haha. I wish I would have invented the Ugg boots back then too haha. agent_2:Yes!  When we're they created?""  I think they have been around since the 1800's? agent_1:They were actually invented by surfers to keep their feet warm on the beach after surfing! agent_2:Nice.  I'm thinking of a different boot then.  lol  The late musician Prince was a fantastic bowler and wore knee high furry boots while doing it. agent_1:That would have been a sight to see!

9431	agent_1:Hi. Do you like comedy?  I didn't know until recently that comedy originated in ancient greece. agent_2:ya I do like comedy, I like that Drew Carey got his start doing comedy when he was in the marines agent_1:I didn't know that. I had no idea he was in the marines!  The greek that comedy was two groups against one another in an amusing conflict. agent_2:yup, comedy is cool it was founded in ancient Greece which I didnt know agent_1:It's got to be hard to do too.  I mean, comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows since 1989. agent_2:that is crazy, its funny too the first comedy film was a guy slipping on a banana peel to fall into horse poop haha agent_1:It is funny.  I'm guessing it was an old film and even still today that would be funny!  Hey,did you know that ancient greece did political satire and it influenced their voters?  Sounds a lot like today's world. agent_2:that does sound like today, I like parody best though, it subverts your expectations and critiques without condemning agent_1:I like that too.  It seems nicer.  Everyone has their favorite though.  Bill Murray thinks kung fu hustle is the supreme achievement of modern age comedy. agent_2:haha I do like that movie, have you seen Evan Almighty? agent_1:I think I have.

I guess for the song Smooth Criminal. agent_1:perhaps. what article you thought was the most interesting? agent_2:Tupac danced ballet in high school and ended up portraying the mouse king in a production of the nutcracker. agent_1:I found interesting the concept with rotten tomatoes. Poor people agent_2:Babies spontaneously dance when they hear music, and smile more when they hit the beat.  Dance is so interesting.  agent_1:Dance truly is interesting. As for the babies dancing spontaneously when they hear music, I totally agree. My child does the same agent_2:Mine do as well.  Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week. agent_1:That I certainly didn't know. She is still too little for ballet lol agent_2:Michael bay's average rotten tomatoes film rating is 38% agent_1:Quite surprising. Also Netflix has almost 150 movies with 100% rating on rotten tomatoes agent_2:I was just reading that.  How cool is that? I like to watch some of the stuff on Netflix. agent_1:I also like to watch movies on Netflix. Its convenient and the premium is not too high	agent_2:Exactly, Spykids received a 93% fresh rating on rotten tomatoes, better than, say, lincoln or the dark knight rises.	agent_1 likes movie. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'music', 'discovery'].
13407	agent_1:Hello, do you know much about the planets? agent_2:Hi! I know a little bit here and there! How about you? I'm a huge fan of Jupiter. In fact, one of its moons (Ganymede) would actually be considered a planet if it orbited the sun. agent_1:That is pretty cool. And Venus does not tilt hence it only has one season agent_2:Thats kind of similar to Uranus as well. It rotates sideways and basically rolls around the sun unlike the rest of the planets that spin. agent_1:And how about that planet where it precipitates shards of glass? That sounds scary agent_2:Yikes! That is scary thankfully we don't have to worry about that here. Did you hear that astronomers detected a planetary system with building blocks of life roughly 455 lightyears away? agent_1:I am so curious about that, so intrigued. How about planet earth? Too bad we have already destroyed 80% of the forests in it agent_2:I know! That's sad, isn't it? If our entire history was seen in a 24 hour period, we as humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds and in that brief time, we've already destroyed most of the natural forests. That is so upsetting.  agent_1:It is very upsetting and we do not seem to be stopping at all. What a shame. When earth was formed the days were only 5.5 hours long. Can you imagine that? agent_2:Wow! I honestly couldn't. We would never have time to accomplish anything! Ha! Can you also believe earth will be basically free of helium when the 21st century ends? agent_1:Yeah that is crazy to me. What about those balloons? Do you believe in extraterrestrials? agent_2:Well, since the UN appointed an ambassador to extraterrestrials, I believe they do expect to make contact eventually. It would truly be neat to see! agent_1:I guess it is better to be prepared, just in case. Did you know sounds in Mars have a different pitch agent_2:That doesn't surprise me honestly.  Just as it would only take 2 or 3 days to get there if one traveled at constant 1G acceleration! Wonder if that's possible? agent_1:Science is moving pretty fast, you never know. And there seem to be organisms that can live in Mars like lichens and cyanobacteria agent_2:Speaking of living on Mars, there's a reality show that's funding a colonization project aimed for 2023. That's going to be interesting to see. Ha! agent_1:Wow, yeah it sounds like it. Did you heat about that confusion between the metric and the imperial system that Locheed Martin did? agent_2:I heard a bit about it. I know they sadly lost a satellite on Mars because of it. It's like that sounds like a very costly mistake. agent_1:Yup is sure seems to have been so. Do you know why Mars is referred to as the red planet?	agent_2:I do and it's because of the red colored iron oxide on the surface that stands out  among the astronomical bodies to the casual eye. Did you know Mars actually has its own polar ice caps as well?	agent_1 likes Mars. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['Mars', 'science', 'organisms'].
2852	agent_1:I've been reading a lot of interesting stories these past few days. agent_2:Really? what have you been reading lately? agent_1:A few different fiction stories, very interesting. One was Tommy Orange's debut novel. agent_2:I heard about that one, its the one with the little native american boy right? agent_1:Yes! It was quite an emotional read. It made me really think about how life is like for them. agent_2:Native Americans suffered for a lot of years, its a story that involves a lot of blood and tears and not an easy story to tell agent_1:Definitely! Orange did a great job w how he shared their history... It was quite diff from the 2nd book I read. A Visit From The Goon Squad, familiar? agent_2:I heard that book was pretty good as well, kind of dark though,  agent_1:For sure, there were some powerful tales. I found the sory about the man born with fetal alcohol syndrome the darkest.

10747	agent_1:Hi there! Have you ever had a pet bird? agent_2:No I haven't but I have memories of friends who did when I was growing up.  How about you? agent_1:Yes, I have had pet birds. I've had cockatiels, parakeets, and some fancier parrots when I was a kid. Did you know the famously extinct Dodo bird, is closely related to the pigeon? agent_2:That is awesome, so you are quite the bird expert.  I didn't know that, very interesting though.   agent_1:Haha! I know a few fun facts about birds. Such as in most birds the bones are so hollow that the feathers weigh more than the entire skeleton!  agent_2:That is awesome, I guess it makes sense though when you figure they have to be able to stay airborne.  agent_1:Apparently, humingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. I was always curious how they built such strong little nests! agent_2:That is so cool, I love learning about how different species in nature interact with each other to help themselves.  agent_1:Yeah, we are learning so much about so many things, these days! There are birds in Australia that can mimic the sound of car alarms, cameras and chain saws. I wonder if they are mockingbirds. agent_2:That is awesome, and yeah good one.  I wonder why they would mimic them as well? agent_1:It's interesting, but I also find it kind of sad that they mimic human made objects. Birds are amazing to me! Some birds fly from Alaska to Mexico, without sleeping when migrating!  agent_2:That is amazing for an animal to do that, sleeping is necessary, some animals sleep for crazy periods of time! agent_1:It would be pretty neat if we evolved wings from our forelimbs! Birds are called Aves sometimes, which makes sense since we call large bird houses, aviaries. agent_2:That would be really wild, and I didn't know that, it does make sense though with the aviaries.  And, aviation is air stuff too. 	agent_1:Ah yes, aviation as well! That one slipped my mind somehow!

Usually around playoffs. Did the Nationals make a mistake? agent_2:I don't think so, they weren't doing too good in the standings plus they're stadium was half empty agent_1:I guess it was time to make a change, maybe rebuild. agent_2:Yea they weren't doing too good, they were in third place in their division behind the Phillies agent_1:I think it's tough to the lineup just right. Too many variables, and the team needs to gel as well. agent_2:Yea and the fans weren't too happy with trading Daniel Murphy, guess he was a fan favorite	agent_1:Did he sell enough tickets though?

Have you seen the new A star is born with lady gaga and bradley cooper? agent_1:No I have not yet but I am watching it next week with friends. How about you? It rose to fame tso quickly agent_2:I haven't seen it yet either.  I heard it's good and that Bradley Cooper directed it as well as stars in it. agent_1:Yeah there is a lot of buzz. And then you have Lady Gaga on the other hand, they seem to make a great duo. agent_2:That's what I've heard.  They say she is not as good an actress as she is a singer but due to editing the movie makes the most of her singing. agent_1:Yeah, I guess. Apparently she got her name Lady because of a text glitch, from radio. agent_2:I didn't know that. I always wondered where it came from.  I like that she takes care of her fans.  I heard she bought a thousand dollars worth of pizza for fans waiting in line to see her. agent_1:Nice. Even LAPD work with her asking her to tweet that there is road work upcoming because she has so many followers. agent_2:That's pretty cool.  Speaking of cool, did you know that the Foo Fighters played a concert once that was so loud it showed up on new zealands seismic monitors? agent_1:Wow that is amazing. There is an ancient roman amphitheatre in crotia that can still be used for concerts. I wonder if theyhave played there.	agent_2:I don't know but it would be great if they did.  That story about lady gaga buying pizza had me thinking about relations with fans.

Maybe one of us will win soon, it hasn't happened since 1853. agent_2:Well I am just hoping Trump doesn't win a second term next year, but with how corrupt everything is now it is looking like a very likely outcome. agent_1:I do too, I don't particularly like him. Did you vote last election agent_2:I did, I voted Hillary even though I didn't really care for her either, but she was a much better choice than what we ended up with. agent_1:For sure, I voted third party. I was part of the problem, I wanted a 3rd party to win because it has been years! agent_2:Well Bernie Sanders just announced his 2020 run, so if he actually makes it onto the ballot this year I will vote for him. agent_1:Yea, he got taken out of the running in 2016 by hillary. I am voting BIDEN! agent_2:If Biden decided to run in 2020 i would probably choose him over Bernie, I always liked him when he was VP. agent_1:For sure, and he would take Trump down. agent_2:I am not sure anyone can take Trump down at this point, with all the rumored election rigging and ties to Russia, I personally think he will just cheat to win again and no one will do anything about it, just like these last 4 years. agent_1:Right, I figured the same thing! I don't think he's good and if he wins I think we know for sure it was rigged. agent_2:Well one problem is the election is based on the electoral college more than actual peoples votes. If we could get rid of the electoral college and get back to the popular vote, like it should be, he wouldn't even have won the first time. agent_1:For sure. They should do it like athens did back in the day. Use a lottery system to prevent oligarchy! I think he is cheating the system	agent_2:Yep and nothing is being done about it.

It is a nod to Kanye's hometown and the city is special to K & K  so the name is perfect because baby Chicago was hard to conceive so she is extra special as well.  agent_1:That's a pretty sweet meaning. Did you know Kim used to be Paris Hilton's personal assistant?  agent_2:I did know. That is how she first gained media attention but after her 2003 sex tape was leaked in 2007 she really became popular.	agent_1:That	agent_2 likes TV show. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV show', 'family', 'baby name'].

It sounds very retro. agent_1:haha that is retro, I never knew that baseball managers could start playing if they wanted to, and thats why they wear uniforms agent_2:Yes I just recently learned that, too, and thought it was very interesting! It might be like an embarrassment to the team to have to bring in a manager like that, though. What do you think? agent_1:haha ya I would think so, can you believe that baseball is super popular in Japan, I had no idea	agent_2:Yea, when I worked for Target a few years ago I remember they'd have Japanese baseball on in the break room along with other TV's with American Sports.	agent_1 likes TV. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV', 'sports', 'baseball'].

I was never good at Tetris though even though it is one of three best selling video games of all.  agent_1:I was into Tetris for a while. My mom got addicted to it and stole my Gameboy a lot. I wonder if she started seeing tetris blocks in her sleep. That happens to some people who play tetris for an extended period of time. agent_2:That is so weird! As an adult I wish i was good at Tetris when I quit smoking or trying to diet because it can offer a quick fix when people are struggling to stick to working on either. agent_1:Yeah, and they also will regularly identify tetromino shapes in real life like in patterns on buldings or in layouts of boxes.

I didn't know that Tetris was actually from the Soviet Union. I thought it was just part of the Tetris design where there were Russian buildings. agent_2:Yes, Alexey Pajitinov was the original designer and programmer. agent_1:You mentioned that Tetris can help with addictions. Well it can also help with PTSD. So if you can deal with seeing Tetris shapes everywhere it might be a good option for PTSD. agent_2:Oh! I'm glad you're still here. I thought you were gone. Well, that is great for PTSD sufferers.  agent_1:No, it just takes me a while to think of what to say. Do you ever play dance video games? agent_2:No, but I enjoy dance performances. Did you know Tupac was a ballet dancer? agent_1:That is neat. Speaking of ballet dancers, they can go through four pairs of pointe shoes a week. Sounds painful and expensive! agent_2:Yes, that does, I agree! I think its cute that babies hear music and spontaneously dance. agent_1:When they hit the beat! So babies can hit the beat but it seems like a lot of us adult forget how to, haha. agent_2:I know I have a hard time! When babies hit the beat it makes them smile.	agent_1:One thing that makes me smileis Michael Jackson's dance.

He wanted to build a 50 foot robot haha agent_2:That sounds pretty wild. I think the mars robots are cute. The Curiosity sings happy birthday to itself on its birthday. agent_1:haha they are cute! did you ever watch Mythbusters? I guess they created a robot sidekick on that show agent_2:I do watch that sometimes but have not seen that episode. I guess the idea of chess playing robots have been around for awhile. Napoleon and Benjamin Franklin lost chess games to a robot, but it wasn't really a robot. A person was hidden inside.  agent_1:haha I remember hearing about that, one thing I'm glad is the US military uses xbox 360 controllers for the eod robots, thats probably cost savings agent_2:Do you worry about robots getting minds of their own? Megatron, a fictional character, was the leader of a civil rights group on Cybertron that wanted equal rights for all robots. agent_1:haha yes I would worry about that, especially now they are putting rat brains into robots, that is scary! agent_2:Really? That is strangely awesome. Have you heard of the home robot Amazon is building? I need one. agent_1:no I haven't, do you know anything about it it sounds awesome! all I know is amazon actually owns imdb, you know that movie site agent_2:Oh, interesting! They are into all types of niches. This project has been many years in the making and it's called the Vesta. We might be able to get it next year, but the robot will likely become a roving Alexa. Unfortunately, it probably won't be a housekeeper.	agent_1:ah thats too bad because thats what I need! Would you work at an Amazon warehouse?

5928	agent_1:Do you like to dance? agent_2:Hello, no I do not , do you? agent_1:I do when I have a few drinks in me lol. I turned into a michael jackson type dancer agent_2:That's funny, I have never been much into it. I can do a few Fortnite dances because my kids force me to. agent_1:lol all kids know how to do that, they are hilarious! Michael Jackson has a patent from that lean he does agent_2:I believe that, music is such a strong persuader. agent_1:for sure, I love music. Babies do too. Did you kids as baby dance a lot? agent_2:My son use to bob his head a lot to music when he was a baby, so I believe it!	agent_1:I believe it too, I am watching my 10 month old right now shake her little behind to some music while standing up ha	agent_2 likes family. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['family', 'music', 'babies'].
7067	agent_1:Hi do you like animals? agent_2:Hi. I love animals. I have a couple of pets. How about you? agent_1:I also love animals,  I have a dog,  but Ive been asking my husband for a dragon for years agent_2:I don't think he'll be able to find that. Out of the 20 quintillion animal types on the planet, I don't think dragon's exist. agent_1:well not the ones I want.  But they do exist,  the kimodo dragon.  agent_2:Oh that's right. I forgot those little guys are still around. Did you know Germany is the first country in the world to give animals legal rights? agent_1:Yeah I think the kimodo dragon actually has its own island too lol I didnt know that,  what rights are those? agent_2:Yes, I think the do have an island. As for the legal rights, I'm not entirely sure but pretty much what humans have. agent_1:I see.  Did you know dogs have 12 blood types?   agent_2:No, I had no idea. That is interesting. Did you know animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated? agent_1:Is that every animal?  I never seen it on any of my dogs or fish.  That is interesting.  agent_2:Yes, my animals have those patches. I think it's all the head pats. agent_1:lol what kind of animals do you have? agent_2:I have two cats. They are rescues, really good cats but they seems to hate the movie Frozen. Did you know that was the first Disney film directed by a woman?	agent_1:Nice,  my dog is a rescue.  I wonder why they hate frozen,  it has such good songs.  No I didnt know that. 	agent_2 likes pets. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['pets', 'animal', 'movie'].
2725	agent_1:Hi!  Do you watch the news? agent_2:Yes I love watching the news. How about you? agent_1:I love the information, but everything these days is so slanted from both sides sometimes it is hard to get. agent_2:Right there is not one source out there that you can trust. I hate the news outlets, but still need to see what's going on. agent_1:Much agreed.  I find that the truth lies somewhere in the middle.  The media tries to create outrage for their ratings. agent_2:Exactly. That's why I watch both CNN and Fox. It kind of helps me to sort through the muck. agent_1:Fox is watched more than Cnn and MSNBC combined.  Kinda crazy to think that. agent_2:I think Fox is slightly more honest than the other two. agent_1:Fox news threatened to sue the simpsons over their constant parody. agent_2:I didn't know that. I don't watch the Simpsons. I know CNN is whining because they can't get any conservative guests. Why would you want to go on their show and be abused. agent_1:Why would a liberal news network want a conservative guest? agent_2:I think so that they can attempt to make them look like a liar or a fool or whatever negative thing they can think of. agent_1:That is true. Did you hear about that time in 1957 when Truman refused to be photographed with Dumbo agent_2:No I didn't. That's funny. Maybe Dumbo wasn't crazy about the idea either. agent_1:Yeah.  Maybe they should have brought Eeyore out	agent_2:Okay you've got me there, who's Eeyore.	agent_1 likes movie. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'TV', 'news'].
4761	agent_1:It is amazing how a certain scent can ellict specific memories from throughout your life isn't it? agent_2:I know, I can catch a faint smell of something and be reminded of something from 20 years ago. agent_1:Yes, like a summer rain always reminds me of walking through the woods as a boy.  It's too bad we can't replicate those scents and be reminded of our childhood all of the time. agent_2:I've never thought about it, but I suppose we don't have names for smells, just where it comes from. agent_1:That's true I refer to a damp basement smell as moldy but why not refer to the smell of onions as 'yuk'? agent_2:It's difficult to imagine having names for each smell, as we have for colors.  I'd think there were too many. agent_1:Yes, but imagine if the defining term could relate to the listener not only what the smell was precisely but perhaps even it's location. Maybe other languages allow for more descriptive labels. agent_2:I suppose if you have to survive, partially because of your nose, it makes sense to be very specific. agent_1:I would think so. I suppose it has validity to convey something with just one word that lets everyone know everything about it. I think it might be difficult if you were to use a smell word with someone who had never smelled that scent before. agent_2:The Semaq Beri speakers take it seriously, especially with the brother and sister thing.  They'd struggle in the city. agent_1:Ha! They would indeed. It is funny how different cultures have taboos that make no sense to anyone but them. Whenever I smell a certain perfume I find myself back in time to my school days and the girl I used to love. agent_2:I guess we have the ability to use our noses in the same way, we just don't have the need.  There's not the peril for us.	agent_1:True. Not many wild predators around to threaten us. It might be interesting to know their names for smells and try to correlate them into our culture, would they mean the same or not.	agent_2 dislikes wild animals. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['wild animals', 'smell', 'no'].

4933	agent_1:Have you heard of Doug Harey? agent_2:Wasn't he an umpire for the MLB? agent_1:Yes he just died at 87 years of age. agent_2:I guess he was a big deal, and he lived quite a while. He'll be missed though agent_1:He must've been an interesting character to earn the nick name 'God'. agent_2:He was one of those umpires that knew what he was doing agent_1:Yup, he earned his spot in the hall of fame after calling 4,673 games. agent_2:And five World Series, which is a big leagues in the MLB. He wasn't intimidated by anyone, it seems	agent_1:He was around to see some of the first world series that first started in 1903.	agent_2 likes history. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['history', 'music', 'sports'].
7045	agent_1:People in Indoenesia do not like crocodiles.  They killed 300 after 1 killed a villager. agent_2:I can see how the crocodiles can be dangerous though. For them, it's about human safety agent_1:I understand, but the guy that was killed was in a protected croc sanctuary. It was kind of his fault. agent_2:And I guess the species is endangered, which is part of why it's a big deal agent_1:Yes.  40 cops tried to stop the crowd, but it turned into a mob of 600 villagers. agent_2:Most of the time they try to remove the animals humanely, but those cases are also in the United States. Those villagers likely acted out of fear agent_1:Yes, in some instances animals that attack are required to be put down and tested for disease like rabies agent_2:On the other end of the spectrum, animals have guaranteed legal rights in Germany agent_1:That is good.  There is a line between public safety and animal cruelty agent_2:As long as the public is safe. In Scotland, the Loch Ness monster is a protected species agent_1:That is funny.  Next it will be bigfoot agent_2:If Bigfoot is in the US, that one may not happen. Although if he has a white patch on his forehead, it's a sign that he's domesticated	agent_1:Apparently humans looked like bigfoot many years ago.

Did you know it started in the great city of New Orleans? agent_1:Yes, I believe I was aware of that fact. Are You a jazz lover ? agent_2:I am! It is a great style some people consider it America's classical music today.	agent_1:Yes sir...

Have you seen it? agent_1:iam really enjoyed for chat for you and you happy  chating for me agent_2:Thank you! I find it fascinating that the original Winnie-the-Pooh books were based on a real boy, the author's son. Did you know that? agent_1:yes i know this books is so great agent_2:I agree! And I loved how the Christopher Robin movie brought the characters to live through a mix of live action and computer animation. agent_1:yes in this book is so interesting character also and nice book	agent_2:Do you have a favorite Winnie-the-Pooh character?	agent_1 likes hobby. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobby', 'TV show', 'book'].
13119	agent_1:Hi! Have you ever traveled to Japan?  agent_2:No, I have not but I have been to Hawaii and had family there when the ballistic missile threat message went out the morning of Jan. 13th. They were really scared. agent_1:Yeah, i remember that! With japan being so small it can cost you $300 to drive across it if you take the highway. Tolls are crazy expensive!  agent_2:Thats crazy! That is just like Hawaii too. agent_1:Are all of their Highways tolled? Are they expensive?  agent_2:They are really cram packed with cars but no tolls. The bad thing about being there is that a missile can get there from North Korea in less than 30  mins. agent_1:Whoa, thats crazy! I had no idea they were so close! Funny to think that China believes that Kim jong un is the sexiest man alive! agent_2:Wow, I did not know that! Yikes! In the era of Kim Jong-un we have to worry about his ability to send a missile over and that's a little scary. agent_1:I agree! Ill be interested to see how the meeting with US president goes later this month. I don't think he is stable.  He assassinated his own half brother.  agent_2:I agree.   He caused terror in Hawaii without even actually sending a missile. The people who were in church during the threat message were told to repent and to end mass early. Some people began crying and praying. agent_1:I would have been worried as well.Kim was ranked the 46th most powerful person in the world in 2013! Thats  troublesome!  agent_2:Oh, wow. That is a weird fun fact, huh. I think Forbes ranked him that. agent_1:Yep, you're right! I wonder if Forbes actually knows how old Kim is?  agent_2:HA! Good point, I doubt it. Its sort of weird that they participated in the Olympics in 2018. agent_1:I agree! I heard that south korea had to pick up the bill for North korea.  agent_2:Thats sounds about right! Everything n North Korea seems fake. Hopefully, Trump can get some more info during their talks. agent_1:hopefully so! They met in Singapore last year to discuss nuclear agreements, i wonder if thats what they will continue to discuss this time around or something else.  agent_2:I wonder that too. Did you know that Kim cuts his own hair? agent_1:hahah i would have thought he has someone else do that! agent_2:He is paranoid about getting hurt, I guess? Ha.	agent_1:He should be.

4563	agent_1:Earth never stops to amaze me, it was formed over 4.5 billion years ago and there is still much to learn about our planet agent_2:I know what you mean.  It is the only object known to have life and we need to know why that is. agent_1:I agree, we must find life in other planets if we want to survive as a species, its sad how 80% of the forests have been destroyed by now agent_2:That is definitely sad and very troubling.  It makes me wonder what will happen to the polar regions with all of the ice. agent_1:Global Warming happened to them and if we dont start caring about our planet we might need to find another one soon. agent_2:Already things are changing.  Did you know that there will be no helium on the planet by the end of this century?  Not only are we losing plants and animals but now we are losing elements. agent_1:I did not know that, I wonder how that will affect us, im sure it will have hidden consequences on life on earth and to think we account to only a small portion of earths history agent_2:I imagine it will have consequences too.  I've heard that when the earth was first formed a day was only just over 5 hours long.  That would be weird.  I guess that means the planet used to be closer to the sun? agent_1:Yeah, it seems that way, or maybe rotated at a bigger speed, you know we  have an embassador in case aliens arrive to the planet or try to make contact with us. agent_2:I didn't know that!  That's actually pretty cool!  I hope he or she is friends with Elon Musk. At the rate he is going, he'll find life before the government does.  He's already planning a colony on Mars. agent_1:Elon Musk is a genious, hopefully he is successful with his colonisation plan, he is also an actor you know agent_2:I didn't know that.  I knew he co founded paypal but I had no idea he acted as well. agent_1:Yeah apparently he acted in a thank you for smoking sketch, and his wife is an actress as well she was in the movie Inception agent_2:Impressive.  I like that he is into solar energy.  He inspired a solar company and now it's part of Tesla. agent_1:He is looking into the future that is for sure, he also wanted to build a vertical take off jet for passangers. agent_2:That would be different. I wonder if it would have benefits that the normal way doesn't.  You know he thinks outside the box.  When he wants to do something he just does it, like shooting a cheese wheel into space. agent_1:That is an absurd way to waste money lol, shooting a cheese wheel into space! amazing but at the same time wasteful. agent_2:If you got it why not?  He is worth over 20 billion dollars after all. agent_1:Yeah I guess so, just seems like a waste with all the poor families and kids without homes in the world, to think Musk was born in 1971, he sure has taken advantage of his time on earth	agent_2:He really has.  I think he can be inspiring.  I can see how it could be wasteful to spend money like that but on the other hand he shows people to just do what they want with what they have.  It's a lot like Galileo back in the day building a telescope.  To me it's a way to say give your imagination free reign and try stuff.  Tesla is an electronic car company that he founded in the day and age where the big automakers dominate but he is giving it a try.	agent_1 likes technology. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['technology', 'news', 'climate change'].

Do you like Spotify ? agent_2:I honestly have never used it,  I hear it has 4 million songs that have never been played though thats kinda sad.  agent_1:yes it is sad. but I just download all my songs from you tube for free agent_2:do you use spotify at all? Did you know a band earned 20k from spotify for a silent album lol 	agent_1:yes but you need like 13745 plays just to make 7.25 a hour	agent_2 dislikes work. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['work', 'music', 'band'].

Didier Drogba  is a soccer player that stopped a civil war in his home country.  agent_1:I read the other day that they have used helicopters to dry off the fields for tennis agent_2:Wow. It's really amazing what they will do for professional sports. And yet grunting in tennis can be considered cheating.  agent_1:Really? I think they do that like every hit! agent_2:The best players seem too. LOL! agent_1:Maybe it gives them an advantage! I know a black man won in 1968, and none have won since, that is odd agent_2:Was that Rodney Wallace's father? agent_1:I am not sure to be honest... I have also heard a tennis player invented the polo! agent_2:That makes me curious about who invented table tennis.  Apparently Ping Pong is the name of the company that sells table tennis equipment. It's not the name of the game. I was surprised when I heard that. agent_1:That is like the kleenex issue! Tennis is pretty much large scale ping pong! agent_2:Totally! Kleenex and Reynolds Wrap are brands that are so well known, their genre of products are known by the company name.  Kind of like Association Football is known just as football, even if it's not a part of the Association.	agent_1:Apparently we call that soccer because it was slang for Association football!	agent_2 dislikes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'greeting', 'sports'].

I can't imagine not having computers now since we have learned to depend on them so much.  agent_2:We sure do, I have an apple computer, I didnt know smoking near it would make my warranty void. agent_1:Really? I didn't know that. back in 1936 some russians actually made a computer that ran on water....how strange is that. agent_2:Really strange, I wonder what happened to that model? maybe water wasnt the best choice.  agent_1:Right! I don't even know how that would work. Very interesting though, also I read someone built a 16 bit computer using nothing but Minecraft building blocks, so crazy how these people get these idea's. agent_2:I know agent_1:So do you like the piano?  agent_2:I accidentally hit the enter tab, I was going to say I know, the world is full with creativity, and I do like the piano I like the sound of it. agent_1:Me too, I did play years ago but not anymore. I love the soothing sound of it. years ago the bbc didn't have any news worth reporting so the just played piano music lol that's awesome. agent_2:That odd considering the news giant BBC is today! did you know that Freddy Mercury played the same piano as Paul McCartney agent_1:My thoughts exactly! Oh wow that's an interesting fact! They built a piano for the Hindenburg and it only weighed over 300 pounds, who would think of putting a piano on that airship! agent_2:That takes some useful weight out of the plane, and maybe someone that is a real piano fan, would be nice to listen to it in the sky though. agent_1:Very true. Piano music is great no matter where you are. It is like poetry to your ears, which I love too. I write some poetry and it's a great stress reliever :) agent_2:I do like poetry, do you like the series of Lord of the Rings? most of the hobbits names are actually names of poetry. agent_1:Oh wow I didn't realize that. I think it's crazy that Edgar Allan Poe only got paid 9 bucks for his famous poem The Raven. Not enough people realize how amazing poetry is. agent_2:That is crazy as its one of the most remembered poems of history, it must be worth millions now a days. agent_1:I know! A very different time back then. So many types of poetry too, I love it and song lyrics most of the time are like a poem. Love it. agent_2:Yeah, did you know about the poem Demetri Martin wrote? agent_1:Is that the palindrome poem? Wasn't it like over 220 words?

10244	"agent_1:Hi There! Do you like movies? agent_2:I like movies, it is a form of art. .  agent_1:This is interesting..Even though spartacus had a cinematographer, stanley kubrick took the camera away from him and did it himself.  agent_2:You have to do it yourself, he was very talented, I saw some of his films, but never Spartacus, is it good ?  agent_1:It is! But this is interesting too..even though he did almost none of the work, when spartacus got the academy award for best cinematography, it went to the credited cinematographer, and not kubrick. agent_2:Probably, some kind of union thing, like he was not an official cinematographer.  I wonder if they gave him something for it.  agent_1:Thats a good question! No woman has ever been nominated for the academy award for best cinematography. agent_2:I guess it is because there is not many female cinematographer because they would not hire them. Sexism still exist.  agent_1:That is terrible. A woman has never even been nominated. agent_2:Yeah, do you see movies made by a woman ? agent_1:I haven't paid attention to that. I'll have to now. Cinematographer roger deakins has been nominated 13 times for the best cinematography oscar, and has never won. agent_2:He was good but not enough, did he do any comedies ? I like those kind of film.  agent_1:I don't think he did. Do you like Bill murray? Bill murray thinks kung fu hustle is ""the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy"". agent_2:I like Bill Murray, Chinese comedies can be really funny. But I never saw kung fu hustle. Did you ? agent_1:no, not my type of movie! I do like Jack black though. The green lantern film was originally going to be a comedy starring jack black agent_2:That would have changed the tone of the movie, he is very slapstick.  agent_1:Some of his stuff is good, Some bad. Did you watch 3rd rock from the sun?  agent_2:I did when I was young, it was good but not memorable, not like Seinfeld.  agent_1:3rd rock from the sun won the golden globe for best comedy series in 1997, beating seinfeld, friends, and frasier. agent_2:That is surprising and not surprising at the same time, we don't know what will stand the test of time, disco was not forever.  agent_1:True! Wow! Comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows since its creation in 1989 agent_2:You have to try new thing and not be afraid to admit your mistakes. Comedy central would have been bankrupt if they continued to produce those 100 unfunny shows.  agent_1:True, I learned this the other day..The creator of the python programming language named it partly to honor british comedy group monty python agent_2:Do you like Monty Python ? I like absurd comedy, so I like them. agent_1:Not really, I never really understood it. agent_2:Don't worry I don't think I would find funny an ancient greek comedy.

I have heard of Tommy Orange's fiction novel about Native Americans. agent_1:That's interesting!  He is a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes.  I don't know much about those two tribes.  His book is about a boy? agent_2:Yes.  It is fiction however.  It provides insight into the challenges that the boy has in grappling with his identity.  We have a national history where many atrocities and slurs dot the history. agent_1:True!  I went to an indian reservation this past summer in New York.  It was the Seneca nation and I went through one of their museums.  They pretty much got kicked out of their land just like all the other tribes in the nation. agent_2:A people divided into tribes cannot stand against a unified enemy.  But, my wife's best friend has a Ph.D. and the government paid for all of her education because she is Cherokee.  But if one knows the facts, a lot of interesting history can be written. agent_1:Wow.  That's really interesting.  Hopefully Tommy Orange's book does well.   agent_2:Books can be fiction with a lot of facts or not so many.  Wiki has an article where they rank fictional characters according to their powers. agent_1:Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction in his youth.  Never knew that he did that before.	agent_2:I wonder how one would find a copy of it.

Dolphins are already smarter then us so how could aliens not exist agent_2:I so believe we'll eventually find some.  But, I feel kind of like Stephen Hawking, it's dangerous to be communicating with them. agent_1:But what if people like stephan hawking understood things we dont' he is on another level of intelligence kind of like elon musk they are the human versions of aliens with their brains agent_2:I agree with you about that.  If we found some aliens, I'd say let's watch them for a good long time before any attempts at communication and they probably feel the same way about communicating with us. agent_1:Exactly if aliens wanted to harm us they could have easily already have done it, they don't want to interfere with us we shouldn't interfere with them agent_2:I agree, there's something to it, though when the UN has a contigency plan in place should aliens ever attempt to contact the Earth.  So, somebody knows something, they just can't alert the masses and create panic around the world. agent_1:So true and don't you find it wierd how drones were first military technology and then a couple of years later it becomes available to the public. Where did the military steal their ideas from drone technology from? agent_2:The same place they stole a whole bunch of their other ""ideas"".  It's just a matter of time, but hopefully Trump will have his Space force up and running by then. Lol agent_1:We're getting into alex jones and joe rogan territory here lol you should watch that on youtube so you can have a good laugh agent_2:I'll have to check it out, for sure.  On a side note, I hear that the Hudson Bay region of Canada has less gravity than the rest of Earth. Wonder why? agent_1:Might have something to do with magnetic fields we need to get neil degrasse tyson on the case he'll figure it out agent_2:Lol, I'm just wondering, will I be lighter on my feet there?  And will the weight of the world not feel like its on my shoulders?  Asking for a friend. agent_1:LOL these are the real questions the people want to know agent_2:Exactly!  I read that Jupiter saves the Earth from getting hit by so many asteroids.  That's very nice of it. agent_1:Poor jupiter its basically a giant shield for our great ball of water agent_2:True and poor old Pluto lost its designation as a planet!  Wow! agent_1:Pluto will always be a planet in my heart lol they can't just suddenly change something like that agent_2:That's how I feel too, about little ole Pluto.  I feel like the bullies are picking on him and I need to stand up and defend the little guy.

8092	"agent_1:hello there  agent_2:Hello yourself> What have you been getting up to tonight? agent_1:Just relaxing, hanging with my dog.  Listening to music. Yourself?  agent_2:Similar regarding the dog. I was talking to my roommate about MLS Soccer.  agent_1:I like Orlando City, personally. I have a good friend who used to play for Manchester United.  agent_2:Really? I bet that was wild.  I didn't think I'd ever need to know much about it myself. We were actually talking about Wayne Rooney a little bit ago.  agent_1:Do you have any thoughts about where Wayne Rooney will end up next year?  agent_2:No thoughts but I've heard talk. Atlanta has gone nuts for MLS the last couple of years. We won the Cup this year and now when you walk into a bar you hear guys speculating about Rooney to DC United next year.   agent_1:Orlando has embraced MLS too, I am quite surprised how popular it has become.   agent_2:I'm with you 110% on that. I haven't heard anyone talk about how embarrassing the Falcons are in weeks.  It makes sense. We haven't ever really had a winner before. I'm wondering if Rooney can still play or if this is like Beckham playing in LA when the MLS began.  agent_1:To switch gears for a moment, I'm listening to Dizzy Gillespie at the moment.  He always was a favorite of mine, a trumpet virtuoso. Did you now that jazz trumpeters often grow goatees because it provides comfort when they play their instrument?  agent_2:I didn't but I can see why that would be appealing.The facial hair I mean. I've tried to like it but Jazz just doesn't do much for me.  New Orleans jazz is sort of the exception. I like the big brass sections. I do like zydeco and that has a lot of jazz influence.   agent_1:I definitely would say I prefer music that's influenced by jazz, rather than jazz itself. Tom Waits is my favorite artist ever, and the influence of jazz is present on a lot of his work.   agent_2:I agree with you about the influence it's had on other music. It's kind of funny that you brought up jazz actually.  It's such a mish mash of musical influences from around the world but it's probably still the most original art form that the United States has ever produced.  That's sort of what we've got going on with the Atlanta FC here.   agent_1:Did you now that the term soccer came from ""association football""? I find that interesting. I always wondered why it wasn't called something else.  agent_2:I didn't know that. I've wondered though.  We've got all of these sports fans here from different places with competing team loyalties.  Except for soccer. Most of them never had a pro team that they grew up rooting for.  They all grew up knowing something about that.  I mean we're talking 250 million players worldwide. Now these guys have a team to root for with no competing loyalties. It's a more communal experience and it has taken off around here.   agent_1:Do you ever go to live games?  It's an experience I have only very recently had an opportunity to possibly enjoy, and yet I haven't.  I wonder if I would enjoy it for the entire duration of the game.  agent_2:I haven't gone yet but I'm going to this coming season.  My interest in other sports has waned so the timing is perfect. Get in on the ground floor of something special you know. It's hard to pick up though. You wouldn't think it would you. A big stretch of grass with a goal on either side's more complex than I thought. Theres way more people to talk about it with too. More than all the major American sports leagues combines in terms of fanbase.  agent_1:Yep, it gives you something to talk about with so many people from different countries. I think that's really cool. They really mean the ""world"" when they said the world cup, unlike the world series, which is just a national matchup.  That's interesting you say it's tough to pick up. I bet the best way to really learn about it would be to play FIFA video games. agent_2:Thats a good point about playing FIFA. That was my only exposure to the sport growing up. There's a much lower barrier to entry to play the game in the real world. Probably part of it's popularity. It's kind of funny. The color scheme and the uniforms here kind of remind me of Harry Potter.  I guess ridiculous hats are a thing in football circles. I don't know how else to explain the goofy ones I've seen around here after FC games.  "	agent_1:Sports fans are definitely responsible for some ridiculous hats, like the oversided cowboy hat, that's like measured in gallons rather than regular hat size. I'm not a hat guy myself, my head's too big.  Speaking of cowboy hats, in the old west, the cowboy hat was not the most common hat worn.  It was actually the bowler, which truthfully is a lot classier looking in my opinion. 	agent_2 likes hats. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hats', 'sports', 'music'].

I am glad that they have the opportunity.  Do you follow the republican party? agent_1:yes, every president with a beard has been a republican:) agent_2:not sure how accurate that is, Trump does not have a beard	agent_1:just meant the ones that have had a beard, it seems like red and blue has been used forever for rep & dems but did you know it only started in 2000?	agent_2 dislikes politics. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'travel', 'no'].

Did you know video games were initially called cathode ray tube amusement devices and were used by the military? agent_2:Yes, cathode ray tubes have come and gone and the game plays on.  I have a Playstation 3, but no plans to upgrade.   agent_1:I have a ps3 as well. I dont see the point to buying a ps4. This one is all I need as well. agent_2:The game Destiny turned me off gaming.  It was fun to play, but it demands network connectivity.  Sometimes the old games are just fun.  Donkey Kong and Mario are still OK.  I see Fifa 14 works on PS2, PS3 and PS4. agent_1:I was never into soccer games. I liked Madden though. Did you know that ps3s are being used to research black holes. agent_2:Yes, people let them run and they network together.  Sort of like the 1760 PS3's used by the department of defense to make a super computer.  Never tried Madden. agent_1:Never played madden. You will have to try it. How about grand theft auto. Have you played that one? agent_2:I do indeed love GTA.  I want to say that I played early rev levels on a PC.  It was a different game back then. FUDGE RIPPLE!  I will search for a disk and see if it is audio. agent_1:THe original game when played in a cd player would play the soundtrack to the game.	agent_2:Interesting.

Are you a big user of Netflix? agent_1:I am a big user, I have an account and use it almost every day, mostly after 9pm, what about you? agent_2:No I don't have an account currently.  So you are one of those that make up using all that bandwidth during peak hours lol.  agent_1:I am a part of that group, yes, lol, its also YouTubes fault as they together with netflix they take upon half of the internet traffic agent_2:Yeah I can totally see that, YouTube is so popular among younger people it's crazy to me.  agent_1:It is really popular, just like Netflix is, its amazing how the service has 137 million subscribers around the globe agent_2:And that number is still growing, thats so many.  But, it is quality stuff, you get access to an insane amount of content.  agent_1:I agree, you get more than what you pay for, I used to spend a lot of money on rentals and those late fees were a real pain to pay agent_2:Yeah I think that is why Hastings started the company in the first place, he was in your same shoes.  agent_1:Could be, so he must hate Star Wars then, do you like the franchise?	agent_2:Yeah I grew up watching the movies years ago when I was a kid, I still think the ones from the late 70's/early 80's are the best ones.

10491	agent_1:Hi, do you use Amazon? agent_2:Hi, are you interested in Google, Amazon, or Artificial Intelligence? agent_1:All three of those actually. They are two of the biggest innovators we have and one of the most interesting scientific fields. agent_2:Yes, I agree. I really enjoy AI although all three of these topics are probably so interrelated that we don't realize it. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is sometimes called machine intelligence (which is actually demonstrated by the machines) in contrast to human intelligence. agent_1:Yes it is amazing what we can hopefully apply AI to in the future. It can really help out with some difficult tasks. agent_2:I took Computer Science in college and it is defined as the study of 'intelligent agents' or any device that perceives the environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. agent_1:I only took a basic Computer Science course, we never delved into Artificial Intelligence. I don't know too much about it besides some basic reading. agent_2:I learned some stuff in Master's level courses and colloquially, the term 'artificial intelligence' is applied when a machine mimics 'cognitive functions' that humans associate with other human minds such as 'learning' and 'problem solving'. agent_1:What do you think the biggest priority should be in the application of Artificial Intelligence? agent_2:Actually, the scope of AI is disputed as machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered as requiring 'intelligence' are often removed from the definition, a phenomenon known as the AI effect, leading to the quip in Teslar's Theorem, 'AI is whatever hasn't been done yet.' agent_1:I know some people are afraid of AI and think machines will become too self aware. I don't think we will ever run into that problem, science fiction has made people too paranoid. agent_2:I totally agree with that since machines are run on computer programs that humans wrote.  Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems such as chess and Go. agent_1:I know I have lost my fair share of chess games to a computer, I even saw a computer compete at very high levels at Jeopardy. It only slipped up when questions were worded somewhat ambiguously.	agent_2:Yes, computers could NEVER actually think like humans can although they can autonomously operate cars, provide intelligent routing in content delivery networks and military simulations.	agent_1 likes technology. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['technology', 'technology', 'yes'].

Do you know how much the first ever Amazon purchase was for? agent_2:No I don't know, do you have any idea, if yes how much was the first purchase? agent_1:Yeah it was for $27.95 and it was for the rights to name a building after themselves.  agent_2:Wow, I will always respect Amazon, because they offer thousandth of people employment rather or not they except it.	agent_1:Yeah they do, do you know that the US postal service has a contract with Amazon to deliver on Sundays?	agent_2 dislikes news. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['news', 'food', 'pizza'].

Did you know there hasn't been a president who wasn't a rep or dem since 1853? agent_1:I wonder who it was! If he had a beard, he would have been republican. agent_2:Not too sure on that.

Did You hear about that ? agent_2:No I didn't ...I'd bet it was more soothing that  the news agent_1:what do You mean, You don't like regular news ? ;) agent_2:Absolutely not. News is often depressing, and I could stand without it. Now, toss on a piano song, or music....now you've got me. Though I hate classical music. Well, most of it. agent_1:I wander if Brits were surprised when instead of news they got piano music instead ;) lol agent_2:They may have thought they won the lottery. I'm an older dude, but give me a nice pounding Elton John or Billy Joel rocker on piano, and I'm rockin' away! agent_1:Hey I'm with You, I mean I'm only 37 but yeah... I'll take ""Piano man"" instead of news any day ;) agent_2:It makes me happy when a younger guy like yourself, I'm 61, still could listen to a good piano song. Didn't realize people your age still know what musical instruments are? Well, not that you're that young. agent_1:hey ! :) I'm young inside ;) but yeah... I listen to all kind of rock, blues and metal... Pink Floyd, Joe Bonamassa, Dire Straits, Metallica, Nirvana... and many more ;) agent_2:Nice!

I saw Nick Cave twice, I won tickets to see Metallica, and I saw King Crimson for the first time. Oh, and I saw Joe Bonamassa too ;) agent_2:You got to see some good ones, that's for sure. I stopped going to concerts years ago!, but man....back in the 70's, seeing Pink Floyd, Bachman Turner Overdrive, Heart and Electric Light Orchestra on the same bill was fantastic....and it was only $15.00 a ticket. agent_1:Holy Crap ! ;) Now to see phil collins it's like $350 and those are not even good seats... ;) times changed, that's for sure... agent_2:Yep. I wish the Factual Section 3 was Rock Music instead of Classical. The only story I have on classical music, is that I was a limo driver for an Arab shiek back in 2001. He bought me a 10 disco best of Classical artists box sex. Wasn't bad, but only listened to it once or twice. That's all I got on Classical music. agent_1:I'm not too close to classical music, but I did like the soundtrack to Space Odyssey 2001 - it's as close to classical I got ;) agent_2:LOL....I hear ya. Oh, and sorry for the spelling, it was ""10 Disc"" and ""box set"" I meant. I'm gonna get killed for that....lol agent_1:lol, yeah I figured that one out ;) although You never know with those Srab Sheik - they like to have a good time :) agent_2:LOL. So, let's see, I covered piano, concert, and classical. Anything else you'd like to bring up? Been nice chattin' with ya! agent_1:Something I'm sure You're aware of - In 1972, pink floyd recorded a live concert at the ancient roman amphitheater in pompeii...with no audience.

Do you follow politics? agent_2:Good morning, I'd say I follow some politics, but not too deeply. agent_1:Were you aware that the taller candidate usually wins in the election. since 1900 it has happened 75 percent of the time. agent_2:Is that so, maybe I should enter politics, I'm over six feet, I could have missed my calling. agent_1:Maybe so. Lol. Did you know that nevada is the only state to have a none of these candidates option while voting?  agent_2:I guess it's nice to have that option, especially if you have one one your really don't want to vote for, for example, someone who doesn't exactly agree with history textbooks. agent_1:On a funnier note. President truman in 1957 refused to have his picture taken with dumbo because he didnt want to be associated with republicans. Lol. agent_2:Media savvy in the days before camera phone and the internet, I would categorize him as forward thinking. agent_1:H sure was. Did you know that the use of red and blue for the two major parties was not used until the year 2000. Crazy huh? agent_2:That is the kind of thing you think has been around for ever.  Maybe that is why we only have two major parties, everyone's two favorites colors are taken. agent_1:I think they should just change all of their colors to brown. During the 2012 elections international electoral observrs were blocked from the polls in nine states. agent_2:That would make me suspicious of what is going on there, why don't they want to be observed?  These are the places that end up with animals becoming mayor, or cats placing high on Senate elections. agent_1:I would say a cat would be better than some of the politicians. So have you ever played fantasy congress? agent_2:Fantasy congress sound like it is taking the whole fantasy sports thing to far.  I can't see many people sitting in bars yelling at CSPAN because their politician has made the wrong move. agent_1:No janet you were supposed to be against abortion. Lol. I v could see it as well. Sorry about that last message. I dont know what happened there.

How much do you know about planets?  agent_2:Hello - I know the alternate names for Earth are gaia, tellus, and telluris. agent_1:That is awesome, I wonder why they settled on Earth.  It is the only one without a God/Goddess name. agent_2:I saw that in 1975 the Soviet Union sent a spacecraft to Venus. agent_1:Wow, maybe that is how they found out it doesnt tilt/ agent_2:You can fit every other planet between Earth and the moon/ agent_1:Wow, I didnt realize it was really that far away.  Does that include pluto, they can't decide about that poor planet. agent_2:I believe it does. There is a planet that orbits four stars. agent_1:There is a planet where shards of glass rain sideways at 4500 mph in 2000 degree F weather.  No thanks. agent_2:That's crazy! Manned space stations orbit Jupiter are impossible due to the intense radiation. agent_1:I would imagine.  I have heard there are pretty violent storms on Jupiter. agent_2:I've heard that too. Even heard you can pick up the strong storms on Earth over radios agent_1:Jupiter has a moon that could be considered a planet if it orbited the sun. agent_2:Wow that's crazy. Do you know much about governors? agent_1:Some, I know Schwarzenegger never lived in Sacramento, he commuted daily by private jet. agent_2:That would be hard to do. It says he went 3 hours per day by private jet. Talk about a long commute. agent_1:i couldnt do that.  time is too valuable. agent_2:I agree. Did you know that Athiests cannot be governor of South Carolina. agent_1:Wow, I didnt know that.  Texas actually elected the first female governor.	agent_2:That's really good to know.

9704	agent_1:Hi. I think it's so fascinating to learn facts about the earth. Earth will be virtually helium free by the end of the 21st-century. I wonder what is causing that? agent_2:Good question! Humans only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds if the entire earths history was viewed as 1 day! agent_1:Wow that is hard to believe. And back when the earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long. agent_2:That is wild! Over 80% of Earths natural forests have been destroyed! agent_1:That is quite sad. Only 20% remaining, well I hope we can conserve that at least. agent_2:Hopefully! Do you think extraterrestrials will ever make contact with us? agent_1:I don't know that is a good question I think at some point but I don't know if it will be in my lifetime. There is definitely a lot of sightings in the literature but no specific evidence. The FDA once burned 6 tons of literature in an active US censorship. agent_2:That is absurd! I love how there is a literature contest that challenges people to come up with the worst opening sentence to a novel. agent_1:That is very funny I would love to read some of those sentences. One surprising thing is that romantic kissing is a fairly recent development and is rarely mentioned even an ancient Greek literature. agent_2:Very interesting. Love how Churchill won a nobel peace prize in literature and not peace. agent_1:Yeah that is very interesting and something I did not know. He was a very smart man. Pretty cool he was  able to accomplish that back in 1953. agent_2:Have you seen the Wonder Woman movie? agent_1:Yes I have it I thought it was really cool. Gal Gadot did a great job. DC comics must've been very impressed. agent_2:Definitely! She actually served in the Israeli Defense Forces for 2 years.	agent_1:Wow she is really an amazing woman.

Also,Germany was the first country in the world to universally give animals legal rights that were constitutionally guaranteed. This was in 2002. agent_1:Sweet!  hmmm domesticated animals develop a white patch,  I wonder if that is only towards horses or all animals.  agent_2:Yeah, I wonder if that occurs naturally or because of how they are bred. agent_1:Maybe.  I know Orcas dorsal fin tends to flop over in captivity but it the wild the dorsal fin it straight up.  agent_2:Interesting. There are so many things to learn about animals, especially knowing that there are 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth. agent_1:i wonder how many zeroes are in a quintillion lol That is a lot of animals!  i love the discovery channel I watch a lot of animal shows.   Did you know theres a breed of horse that has a fifth speed?  I guess it is called a tolt.  agent_2:I heard a tolt is speedwalking for a horse. That's pretty funny! agent_1:That is cool,  horses got places to go!  speed walking is helpful.  agent_2:I can't imagine being allergic to horses. I would be devastated. Apparently Clint Eastwood developed an allergy to them although he has been on horseback in many of his movies. agent_1:Yeah I know right,  hes in so many western movies,  I guess he had to take daily claritin for his allergies!   agent_2:Haha. I am glad we get to use horses for leisure these days or for recording movies, haha. Historically they were used in warfare. agent_1:did you hear about the lipizzaner horses?  They are born a dark color and later turn white?  Thats amazing! agent_2:That's totally weird. I had not heard about that. Horses are great runners, but apparently we are the best distance runners. agent_1:Maybe because we train with the knowledge we have to run far.  Animals just run for fun or because they have to.  agent_2:Well, that makes sense. We also cannot synthesize vitamin c like plants or animals. agent_1:Damn defective gene.

I prefer Harry Potter. agent_1:nice, that is a good one. did you know the actor who play malfoy was caught trying to steal the wand? agent_2:I would hope they would let him have the wand anyway. I would imagine those actors deserve the memorabilia.  agent_1:i think so too. when daniel won the part of harry potter, do you know what his reward was? agent_2:I think his parents let him watch Faulty Towers. I am only vaguely familiar with the TV show but I would imagine it is still a fun classic show in the UK. agent_1:yeah and he must have been so happy to be able to do that	agent_2:Yes, I am sure he is very grateful for being able to be apart of the movies.

How does it get back to earth? agent_2:Right, I'll have to look that up.

Jazz trumpeters grew goatees because it provided comfort when playing.  agent_2:that is interesting. Tupac Shakur studied jazz when he was in baltimore school of the arts agent_1:I would not have expected that at all. Things may have gone differently for him had he followed that passion. I know that the New Orleans style of jazz started in the 1910's.  agent_2:thats over a 100 years ago. Jazz has been seen as a major form of musical expression since the 1920's  agent_1:That is an old form of music especially compared to the most popular forms of music now. Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts. agent_2:I never new that . Did you know that louis armstrong ended the beatles three months on the billboard top 100 agent_1:WOW! I didn't think anything could stop The Beatles. No offence to Armstrong but I know a lot more people that still listen to The Beatles.  agent_2:This is a pretty interesting guitar fact,  A dial tone is in the key of f, serving as a pre-internet trick to tune your guitar agent_1:WOW! That's clever. I enjoy guitar music. Queen's guitarist, Brian may, has a PHD in astrophysics. agent_2:he also built a guitar out of parts from an old fire place and his mothers knitting needles . super smart agent_1:Yes. Honestly all of Queen always struck me as a very intelligent group of men. I am also a big fan.  agent_2:I agree. did you know that the nokia ringtone  from a 1902 composition by spanish classical guitarist and composer francisco tarrega, called gran vals. agent_1:I did not.

444	"agent_1:Do you like rap music? agent_2:I do, but I cannot tolerate Kanye West. I adore Tupac, and think it's interesting that the Library of Congress chose his music to be included because it's culturally significant. agent_1:I agree, Kanye's old music was really good. He's just out there. Just like how he thinks AIDS is a man-made disease.  agent_2:I just don't care for him. I would have loved to have been in the courtroom, the day a judge decided to give her ruling to Eminem, in rap style. agent_1:That would have been funny. Speaking of Eminem, did you know that his true dream was to become a comic book artist? agent_2:Yes, Spidey is his favorite.

I love how people think the cowboy hat was the most popular in the old west, yet it was really the bowler. agent_1:Yeah, cowboy hats were more as working hats weren't they? Did you know that up until 1998 politicians had to wear a top hat if making a point of order in the House of Commons? agent_2:I did not. That sounds interesting. Much like the ""tip of the hat"" originates from Knights raising their visors. agent_1:That is interesting too. I heard that in 1908 a law was passed limiting the length of hatpins."	agent_2:They did that, so they wouldn't be used as weapons. Smart move.

7903	agent_1:Hi, do you like baseball? agent_2:Yes, I grew up in St. Louis in the 70's so I used to love the Cardinals, KC in the 90-00's so a big Royals fan and I've been in Boston for 4 years so I have enjoyed local baseball in all three towns. Are you a fan?  I knew that managers wear uniforms in the dugout because they can technically play and there were player-managers in the old days, but when the last time a manager actually played in a game? agent_1:Hi, yes I like baseball , and sports in general....and is true I have never seen a manager playing!! but is good they are ready in case they are needed! agent_2:It's funny baseball is so popular in Japan that many fans don't know it was America's pastime. I guess they forgot WW II, it was brought there by occupying US Troops after Japan surrendered.  agent_1:Wow that is impressive, they kind of ignored how americans feel about baseball.. i think the Chicago cubs have not won in a long time! agent_2:Yes, first team to win back-to-back World Series and not another one for 108 years (Ottoman Empire was still in existence when they last won a World Series?), that ironic. As a St. Louis fan growing up I did go to quite a few games at Wrigley Field along the way before they  had lights which made a good afternoon. As I have a lot of Cub fan friends that World Series win was quite something, though many of them felt relief instead of happiness after the win. agent_1:That is really cool history right there. Would be nice to see a win from the cubs again. Do you know what a very lucky man found in his grandfather's attic? agent_2:You mean the $3 Million dollar baseball card collection? Yes, I collected and bought some rare cards at a shop and know have no idea where they album are, a luck garbage collector might have found them when my mom cleaned out the attic long after I moved out. Being in Red Sox land, there's always the ghost of Babe Ruth, when you look at the big guy he doesn't look fleet of foot, bunny he lost the '26 World series getting caught trying to steal home down by one run. Funny thought, though I doubt Yankee fans thought that , that year. agent_1:wow, you collected those too!  I am amazed those cards lasted hidden since the 1940's!! agent_2:Yes, I think every kid 1940-19808 probably did. You see where in the '92 World Series the US Marine Corp color guard carried the flag upside down, I wonder if that was planned to psyche them out or distract them from the game plan or totally an accident? agent_1:I would be funny if it was an accident.. You lknow? I really like hoe the world series are played.. It is not just one game..you get a seven game playoff and the excitement lasts more than other sports! agent_2:Yes, that makes it fairer to the best team. You can win on a fluke shot  or play in one game (i.e. Super Bowl, NCAA Champion), but to win 4 or 7 is more skill. I am a Royals fan and they Won the World Series 4-5 years ago and then lost all their best players to free agency or like Justin Verlander leaving the Tigers and going to the Astro's. With small market teams the skill isn't always evenly distributed around the league.  agent_1:Yes that is kind of sad.. and Verlander helped so much the Astros to win.. it was the right move.. for the Astros agent_2:Yes, there's two sides to every story. Though small market teams don't have the draw of the Yankee's or Dodgers, you see where the Women's World Cup had higher TV  rating than the World Series in the US last year? agent_1:I am a soccer fan and the womens world cup grew a lot in popularity since the last one! But I was shocked to learn that is was watched more than the world series!! agent_2:So was I, speaking of fans. My wife loves Game of Thrones, we're binge watching it getting ready for the final season, do you watch it? It has some great blood lines, did you see where Charles Dickens great-great-great grandson and Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter are both actors on the HBO Series?	agent_1:I do not watch but I know is really really popular!!

Did you know pilgrim clothing was full of color? agent_1:Thats so interesting also, I heard they only wore black on special occasions, only humans wear clothing also  agent_2:Yes I saw that as well. There's a store in Alabama that only sells clothes, cameras, etc. that are found in unclaimed baggage.  agent_1:Normally bigger corporations have enough power to make decisions like that. But that's not ethical is it 	agent_2:Yea I don't think that's ethical either.	agent_1 dislikes environment. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['environment', 'food', 'food tradition'].

One was Tommy Orange's debut novel. agent_2:I heard about that one, its the one with the little native american boy right? agent_1:Yes! It was quite an emotional read. It made me really think about how life is like for them.	agent_2:Native Americans suffered for a lot of years, its a story that involves a lot of blood and tears and not an easy story to tell	agent_1 dislikes history. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['history', 'books', 'fiction'].
6093	agent_1:Hello, are you a baseball fan? agent_2:I do not know much about baseball but I have been to a bunch of games, including a few Yankee games. It does have the second highest attendance. agent_1:Baseball games are fun to go to but they take a long time. I usually end up walking around the concourse for a couple innings. agent_2:I never knew why baseball managers wore uniforms. I thought it was just to blend in with the team and support the team. Ends up they are able to play if the need arises. agent_1:Looking at some of the managers today I think it's more of a tradition now. I know in the past there were a few times where there were actual player/coaches. I believe Ted Williams was one. agent_2:I found it very surprising that a married couple had been scheduling all 2430 major league baseball games up until 2005. I figured it was just a computer. agent_1:Baseball is deep into it's tradition. They probably didn't worry about any form of software until it became too complicated. agent_2:You're right. That's probably why baseball cards are so popular too, tradition. A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in his grandfathers attic. agent_1:Also the market was not as saturated back then as it is today, now so many different companies make cards that there isn't a chance for them to be as rare. agent_2:I never knew that is why the old ones are so valuable. I thought it was simply the popularity of the player. In Japan baseball is so popular fans do not realize it is actually America's pastime. I wonder what their baseball cards go for.	agent_1:It's interesting when a Japanese player wants to play in the MLB. The team gets money for that player leaving.	agent_2 likes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'software', 'no'].

I was surprised to hear that he is signed with Lil' Wayne's label, instead of Dre's Death Row. agent_1:Yes,  that was very interesting,  although either way he still would've made a lot of money agent_2:I think One Dance is my favorite by him, it's also one of his most popular."	agent_1:me too,  that song was great!  good talking to you 	agent_2 likes music. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'sports', 'music'].

How about you? agent_1:I love Google, i can't stand other search engines like bing or yahoo agent_2:I refuse to use Bing because I despise Microsoft even more than Google.  agent_1:lol, Google is incredible though, it requires more computing power for one search than it took to send neil armstrong to the moon! agent_2:Yeah, pretty much any kind of personal electronic device these days would put the supercomputers of that period to shame. agent_1:that is very true, a lot has come since back then.

12046	"agent_1:Do you have hope for Pelosi and the democrats in providing balance to the government at this all important time in history. agent_2:I am not very into politics. The modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson. agent_1:Pelosi is the new Speaker of the House. She was not very welcomed in Florida a couple of months back when she was in Florida campaigning for the democrat candidate. agent_2:Why not? Anything in particular? agent_1:She is just not well liked because of her brash personality I presume. agent_2:I see. Did you know There hasn't been a us president who wasn't a republican or a democrat since 1853? agent_1:No, but I would have ventured a similar guess. To add to your point, the colors of blue and red have been used to differentiate the parties since 2000 agent_2:I thought it was longer than that! Every us president with a beard has been a republican. agent_1:Yeah, that was a weird fact. Another similar one would be the fact that Truman refused to be photographed on a ride at Disneyland. agent_2:I heard it was because it was the dumbo ride and so he wouldn't be associated with republicans agent_1:Silly.  We need another tough progressive like Teddy Roosevelt. agent_2:The last time a republican was elected president without a nixon or bush on the ticket was 1928! agent_1:That is quite some time. There are very few conservative democrats left in office. agent_2:The GOP presently hold ""trifectas"" (the executive branch and both chambers of the legislative branch) in a majority of states (26/50), and a ""trifecta plus"" (executive, legislative, and judicial branches) at the federal level, as five of the nine current Supreme Court justices were appointed by Republican presidents. agent_1:I think that might be higher with the confirmation of Kavanaugh recently.  agent_2:Likely! Here's a funny fact; Fox news threatened to sue the simpsons in order to stop them from parodying its famously anti-democratic party agenda. agent_1:Sounds just like fox.

11611	agent_1:I recently learned that the earth is the densest planet in the solar system.  I wonder if that helps it to support all of the water on it. agent_2:That is one possibility. Water is a very important resource that helps give life on earth. agent_1:Yes it does and the earth's surface is covered by about 71% of water.  The polar regions are covered in ice but that is just frozen water so-more water on the earth's surface. agent_2:That is true although I am not much into the science of earth. However I do appreciate the facts about the environment.  agent_1:Do you like planets in general?  Have you seen or noticed the five planets in the sky at night that can be seen by looking at them? agent_2:I like planets. And yes I have been able to see them when they are noticeable. I love It when I can see the stars so bright and clear. It's a shame that there aren't so many areas where you can see them due to Earth's atmosphere being affected.  agent_1:I agree with you on that.  It's extremely unfortunate that more than 80% of our planet's forests have been destroyed. agent_2:It is very devastating. Hard to believe that so many years ago there was so many trees and other living creatures we can't even see alive today anymore. agent_1:I know.  It makes me wonder what the planet was really like originally.  I know scientists say that in the beginning a day was on just over 5 hours long but I'm not sure they can actually know that.  So, I still wonder what all happened here long ago and what life was like. agent_2:Yeah I know what you mean. It doesn't seem logical that it was only 5 hour days. Although if they believe that then their time table of billions of years is very flawed.  agent_1:Good point!  What do you think about all of the helium going to be gone from the planet by the end of the century? agent_2:I am a littler concerned because who knows how it will affect the planet. I mean Helium is used for a few things. For all we know it may even affect gravity somewhat.  agent_1:You're absolutely right.  We don't know exactly what will happen.  It may cause us to lose other things.  The steady depletion of the helium will probably create problems as we go along. agent_2:It most likely will. I also wonder why the Helium is depleting so much and why it will be completely gone. I mean it just makes me think as to why this resource is really going down. agent_1:I hadn't thought about that the reason why it is.  That is interesting to consider.  I mean, is it because of forest depletion or something else? agent_2:It could be because of forest depletion or it could be because of all the pollution. Plus with the billions of people, resources are being taken and hardly being created.  agent_1:I wonder if it's a chain of life sort of thing too. I mean, if an animal becomes extinct that can change the population of another animal species and so on.  Could it be that elements have that kind of effect on each other?  If so, what did the planet lose that is causing helium to go away?	agent_2:That is a lot to think about and to consider. I mean our planet Earth took a huge change in environment during the era of factories and iron and metal industry taking off.	agent_1 dislikes environment. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['environment', 'astronomy', 'stars'].
2699	agent_1:Do you own a pet snake? agent_2:No but there are some snakes outside around where I live at. agent_1:They are considered legless lizards. I like lizards but not snakes agent_2:What is your favorite type of lizard? agent_1:Iguana by far. I almost bought a baby one yesterday. I was looking at Chameleons too agent_2:Would you ever consider owning a larger one like a crocodile? agent_1:Heck no. They are illegal too, aren't they? agent_2:Oh I didn't realize they were illegal to own. agent_1:They are more closely related to birds and I only like parrots for birds, and the bald eagle of course agent_2:Do you like Taylor Swift? agent_1:I do, kinda. I like her as a person. She seems humble and very likeable agent_2:Yea, she also walks backwards around paparazzi. agent_1:She was born and raised close to where I grew up in Pennslyvania too	agent_2:Do you know about the Tennessee state?	It is unclear if the agent_2 likes or dislikes state. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['state', 'animals', 'lizard'].
9022	agent_1:Hey how is it going today, have you heard of the axe-murderer in New Orleans by chance? Scary! agent_2:I  did, I thought that was a terrifying story as well, King Zeno, sure seems like a scary piece agent_1:That would be scary to see that guy for sure, it sounds as if he had PTSD, this was apparently a while ago but still, mental health should have been treated a lot better then! agent_2:I know right, I wonder if its based on real life events? King Zeno is one hell of a scary novel, not apt for everyone agent_1:For sure, it is about a century old but still so scary. Do you like to listen to jazz music? agent_2:I love it yeah, what about you? do you like the genre agent_1:Not a huge fan but a fan of the historic value of jazz, there's so many types of jazz like swing, Kansas City Jaz, and Gypsy jazz. What other kind of music do you like? agent_2:It has deep roots that go almost a hundred years ago, it means a lot to many people, nice tunes and melody agent_1:For sure, Clint Eastwood is a lifelong jazz fan, which is pretty surprising to be honest given his previous roles. agent_2:Really his a fan? well he has great musical taste then, I hear Pakistan has a great Jazz orchestra agent_1:I would never have guessed that. Have you ever noticed that a lot of jazz trumpeters have goatees? Apparently it is to provide comfort while they play. agent_2:Ive always wondered about those out of style goatees I guess it makes sense to grow them if its for comfort however weird they look agent_1:True, it'd be tough to be playing it for so long without anything there I am assuming. You a big fiction or non-fiction fan? agent_2:I prefer fiction and just let my imagination fly, do you have a favorite author? agent_1:Not really, I would like to check out some Julius Caesar though, he apparently wrote fan fiction about Hercules, would be neat to read that. agent_2:That sounds like a great piece of literature, I like George RR Martin, I bet he would dislike the works of Ceasar agent_1:It'd be really interesting to just read it, that's almost 2000 years of difference but the same story being told. It's so sad that in the 1950s a judge tried to ban a comic because it featured a black character, what an embarassment. agent_2:I know right, luckily times have changed but that kind of behavior makes me really angry,  agent_1:Me too, it's terrible to think about people being so willfully ignorant, they have to acknowledge that racism is wrong and it's still here. I wonder what a world would look like without racism, they should write a book on it. I guess it'll be fiction for a while though. agent_2:Hopefully one day we will see that, a society free of racism, hate only creates more hat and maybe fiction is the way to make that happen, its sure nice to imagine a world like that one agent_1:It would be nice to imagine that world, it better be coming soon. Well I am going to call it a night, I hope you have a great one and take care!	agent_2:Lets hope that day comes soon and take care as well have a good night I think im calling it a night as well. 	agent_1 likes goodbye. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['goodbye', 'music', 'music genre'].
8033	agent_1:Many people enjoy chatting on the Internet. Do you? Do you like computers? agent_2:I do actually, I use the computer a lot. I just do not have that kind that the russians made that runs on water	agent_1:The water computer sounds alien, like something that Elon Musk would create. I wonder how fast that darn thing ran. As fast as Windows 8 maybe.	agent_2 likes technology. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['technology', 'computer', 'hobby'].
13617	"agent_1:Do you like Justin Timberlake?  He has a tour called ""Man of the Woods""? agent_2:I have never been that huge of a fan, but I have heard his concerts are amazing.  I remember watching the HBO special of his Madison Square Garden show.  Are you a fan? agent_1:No, I'm not.  I don't dislike him however... I guess people aren't quite buying his re-branding.  One said, ""all the flannel in the world couldn't warm critical reception to the tour."" agent_2:Haha, that is a great line.  I think he became a lot more personable after marrying Jessica Biel.  He has definitely come a long way from Nipplegate. agent_1:Ha.  He seems to be more effect.  Many think he should stick to his hits and not try to change too much.  agent_2:I have heard some call his new tour empty, but that ""many people enjoy empty fun.""  Sounds poignant, but also a shot at society! agent_1:I think the detractors mainly don't like the theme and think he should do shows as he has always done. agent_2:Yes, people love the old stuff in general.  One of the best-selling albums of 2014 was Dark Side of the Moon.  Over 40 years after being initially released! agent_1:Yes, it's a classic.  Pink Floyd is different.  They turned a houseboat into a floating recording studio on the river Thames. agent_2:Haha, yup they are awesome.  I was a being fan of Linkin Park.  Very sad to hear what happened to them after having one of the best selling album's of the 21st century. agent_1:What happened to them?  I know ""Hybrid Theory"" was the album of which you speak.  agent_2:*Big fan I meant.  The lead singer passed away recently. agent_1:Oh, sorry to hear that.  On a lighter note, two identical twins in Japan released a rap album when they turned 100 in 1992. agent_2:That is remarkable!  Sounds about as wild as the president of Indonesia releasing 3 pop albums while in office! agent_1:Yes, as wild as scientist voting the song ""We are the Champions"" as the catchiest song of all time.  I miss Freddy... agent_2:Me too :(  Those were the good old days.  When Eddie Van Halen literally set fire to the speakers when recording ""Beat It."" agent_1:His amp must have gone to ""11"" like in the movie Spinal Tap.  Funny, Ricky Gervals was a pop singer in the 1980's.  agent_2:I cannot picture that!  They all have interesting quirks.  LIke Brian May using coins instead of guitar picks."	agent_1:Or Matthew Bellamy from Muse destroying so many guitars.  Sad, he should donate them to a good cause.  That's been done, move on...	agent_2 likes music. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'rock', 'Linkin Park'].
2127	agent_2:No I didn't know that either. I wonder if other animals can do that? Like can we Harvest Pig ribs for food and then they will regrow that way we don't have to kill the pig haha agent_1:That would be awesome! I'm sure science will figure that out someday! We can already use our current technology to date the extinction of ground sloths and determine where ancient human footprints led to. agent_2:That's really cool. I would love to see that. They should put that in the movie! I think it's cool that humans are adapted for persistence running. We are some of the best animals in the world at it agent_1:Haha yea that would be cool. That's really surprising humans are the best at persistence running! I wouldn't have guessed that. As long as those pesky hiccups don't attack while running! Darn evolution leftovers! agent_2:Haha yep hiccups are so annoying! So is that frequency that causes fear in humans ,have you heard about that LOL? agent_1:No, I had not. So fear comes from sound...? I thought it had to do with the autonomic nervous system, fight or flight thing? That would be really interesting to look into further.  agent_2:Can come from sound. And yes I'm going to look into that further as well. Do you like any animals by the way? agent_1:I used to own two cats, no current pets though. I would love to go to Japan and play with some cats at a cat cafe though! haha agent_2:Haha that does seem like a great idea! Get a drink and pet a cat LOL. Did you know that a cat will spend 10 years of its life sleeping when it's only 15 years old LOL that's a long time agent_1:That is nuts! What I wouldn't give to trade places! Or trade places with Stubbs, the cat who is the mayor of Talkeentna, Alaska! Sounds like a sweet gig. agent_2:It does sound awesome! I don't know what kind of work she does but she must be doing a great job lol have you ever seen the movie The Godfather by the way agent_1:Right? Haha And yea I've seen the Godfather but it's been a while. agent_2:Well in the opening scene the cat that they use, I don't know if you remember that part, but it was actually a stray apparently agent_1:Yea, I vaguely remember, that's awesome. Another sweet gig for a cat! Now if only I woulda thought to have one of my cats coauthor a book with me. I guess some physicist did so so that he could use the first person plural without being criticized! agent_2:That is funny! What do you think about Scotland putting a lot in place to protect the Loch Ness monster? Do you think that means he might exist LOL	agent_1:Haha that is strange. It definitely makes one wonder...maybe the loch ness is some super secret scientific experiment or military weapon? Haha I guess thanks to the Germans, who in 2002 were the first to give animals constitutionally guaranteed legal rights, Scotland can do what it wants concerning the Loch Ness!	agent_2 likes politics. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'movies', 'favorite movie'].
10164	"agent_1:Hey, how's it going? Are you a fan of Phil Collins at all? agent_2:Yea Phil Collins is a pretty good singer, I never knew he was in the beatles movie ""A Hard Day's Night"" agent_1:Yeah I liked Genesis in particular, back when he was paired up with Peter Gabriel. Though they've both had solid solo careers. agent_2:Yea, it's crazy Collins sold 100 million in Genesis and as a solo act agent_1:Do you have a favorite song from Phil Collins or Genesis? agent_2:I really like the 1984 hit ""Against All Odds"" agent_1:I'm a big fan of Invisible Touch. That was after Peter Gabriel left and it more just Phil Collins leading the way. Right before he went solo. agent_2:Yea, ""In the Air Tonight is also a great song, it's cool that Collins 17 year son gets to play concerts with his dad agent_1:Are you more a fan of pop or rock music?"	agent_2:Probably Rock music but they were basically the same thing until the late 1960s	agent_1 likes music. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'music', 'yes'].
5939	agent_1:Do you like to dance? agent_2:Hello, no I do not , do you? agent_1:I do when I have a few drinks in me lol. I turned into a michael jackson type dancer agent_2:That's funny, I have never been much into it. I can do a few Fortnite dances because my kids force me to. agent_1:lol all kids know how to do that, they are hilarious! Michael Jackson has a patent from that lean he does agent_2:I believe that, music is such a strong persuader. agent_1:for sure, I love music. Babies do too. Did you kids as baby dance a lot? agent_2:My son use to bob his head a lot to music when he was a baby, so I believe it! agent_1:I believe it too, I am watching my 10 month old right now shake her little behind to some music while standing up ha agent_2:Did you see the black panther movie? agent_1:Yep, it was a great movie. A lot of people watched it, I think it made a billion or more at the box office, did you? agent_2:I cant believe Disney now owns all of Marvel! agent_1:Right, talk about a great investment! Black Panther is the richest of all superheroes agent_2:Really I would have thought Tony Stark would have been! agent_1:Me too, or Batman! I think Black Panther is worth 500 billion dollars! agent_2:That's crazy I wonder if he would use Siri? Im sure he uses a virtual assistant somewhere in that fortress of technology. agent_1:right lol. I have siri but never utilize that technology much, do you? agent_2:I use it only to make my grocery list! What voice do you use for yours? agent_1:That is a great idea, I just use the default one, the original I think. How about you?	agent_2:I recently switched from the Australian voice to the U.K version, gotta keep my women interesting fresh!	agent_1 likes voice. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['voice', 'video games', 'game genre'].
13403	agent_1:Hello, do you know much about the planets? agent_2:Hi! I know a little bit here and there! How about you? I'm a huge fan of Jupiter. In fact, one of its moons (Ganymede) would actually be considered a planet if it orbited the sun. agent_1:That is pretty cool. And Venus does not tilt hence it only has one season agent_2:Thats kind of similar to Uranus as well. It rotates sideways and basically rolls around the sun unlike the rest of the planets that spin. agent_1:And how about that planet where it precipitates shards of glass? That sounds scary agent_2:Yikes! That is scary thankfully we don't have to worry about that here. Did you hear that astronomers detected a planetary system with building blocks of life roughly 455 lightyears away? agent_1:I am so curious about that, so intrigued. How about planet earth? Too bad we have already destroyed 80% of the forests in it agent_2:I know! That's sad, isn't it? If our entire history was seen in a 24 hour period, we as humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds and in that brief time, we've already destroyed most of the natural forests. That is so upsetting.  agent_1:It is very upsetting and we do not seem to be stopping at all. What a shame. When earth was formed the days were only 5.5 hours long. Can you imagine that? agent_2:Wow! I honestly couldn't. We would never have time to accomplish anything! Ha! Can you also believe earth will be basically free of helium when the 21st century ends? agent_1:Yeah that is crazy to me. What about those balloons? Do you believe in extraterrestrials? agent_2:Well, since the UN appointed an ambassador to extraterrestrials, I believe they do expect to make contact eventually. It would truly be neat to see! agent_1:I guess it is better to be prepared, just in case. Did you know sounds in Mars have a different pitch agent_2:That doesn't surprise me honestly.  Just as it would only take 2 or 3 days to get there if one traveled at constant 1G acceleration! Wonder if that's possible? agent_1:Science is moving pretty fast, you never know. And there seem to be organisms that can live in Mars like lichens and cyanobacteria	agent_2:Speaking of living on Mars, there's a reality show that's funding a colonization project aimed for 2023.

1604	agent_1:Hey there what do you know about the prime minister of the UK? agent_2:I don't know that much actually. He has a cat though.  agent_1:I love the name of the cat. The name is Chief Mouser of the cabinet office LOL can't say I like cats though haha agent_2:Hilarious. What happens if someone is allergic?  agent_1:I am actually allergic to cats. And that's a great question haha do you know who Helena Bonham Carter is? agent_2:yeah, she was in Fight Club, other than that I don't remember many of the movies with her.  agent_1:Apparently she's related to the prime minister of the United Kingdom during World War I. That's very bizarre agent_2:Really? That is pretty weird. Did you know if you hit 100 in japan they give you a silver cup?  agent_1:I did not know that. It's funny that so many people turned 100 they had to find a way to make cheaper cups though haha agent_2:Hilarious, at least they are healthy there.  agent_1:That's true they're definitely not giving those Awards away in the United States haha. I do like that Norway donated a billion dollars to save the Amazon rainforest though that's very nice of them agent_2:Yeah, that seems interesting, do they do a lot of business there?  agent_1:I'm not sure actually. They might have just donated it because they're nice. Unlike The guy who sold the Eiffel Tower twice who definitely just wanted the money haha agent_2:That's hilarious, he wasn't even the owner. Did you know Johnny Depp directed the film brave?  agent_1:Oh I didn't know that. Have you seen that movie is it any good? agent_2:I haven't actually. LOL BTW, apparently 86% of the land in Nevada is owned by the US Government. 	agent_1:Wow that is a lot. Very strange that Johnny Depp is making a movie about dr suess.

245	"agent_1:I think its sad to have to part with a pet due to allergies and couple conflict like in the Dear Amy section. agent_2:That is sad. Do you have pets? The first cloned pet was a cat and its name was copy cat. agent_1:Yes, I have a dog.  Sounds like in the Dear Amy that they do everything tit for tat. The cat owner states that her fiance has to get rid of his saltwater fish if she gets rid of her cat.  That's not necessarily fair though I don't think.  They seem like they may struggle as a couple in the future. agent_2:Yeah that's a bit dramatic! A cat lover is known as an ailurophile and a dog lover is known as a cynophile. agent_1:Allergies can be serious to people.  I understand his reserve of having a cat. agent_2:Me too. A pet or companion animal is an animal kept primarily for a person's company, protection, or entertainment. No one should have to be made uncomfortable by a pet in the house. agent_1:I'm sure she loves the pet, but she has to make a choice if the pet is harming her fiance. agent_2:Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described. I'm sure they can find one to agree on.  agent_1:Did you ever hear that animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated?  That's a new one to me.   agent_2:That's interesting! Of the 1.5 million species, 1 million are insects! Yuck! agent_1:Apparently, there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.  If you want to live forever, you can look into being a jellyfish. agent_2:Fascinating! In japan, there are more pets than there are children under 15. agent_1:Teddy Roosevelt had over 20 pets and his own real ""teddy"" bear along with a hyena agent_2:Wow! There are more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia. agent_1:I never met anyone with a tiger pet.  That is strange.  It's not legal to own pets in Boulder, Colorado but you can be their guardian."	agent_2:Lots of places have special animal rights.

It must be incase of injury or something. It's a strange rule. Did you hear the story about the man who found a bunch of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic?

367	agent_1:Can you recommend any movies to watch? agent_2:Do you like Star Wars ? The movie about Hans Solo just came out on Netflix.  agent_1:Is that the one where its about a young Han Solo? agent_2:Yeah it is the one, so Han Solo is not played by Harrison Ford, does it affect your opinion of the movie ? agent_1:Someone else can fill Harrison Fords shoes? Maybe ill check into how well this Alden guy does in the role agent_2:He did a good job, but Han Solo was already young in the 1977 movie, I think it impacted negatively the movie.  agent_1:Does Chewbacca appear in this movie? agent_2:Yes it does, but it is not the same actor who did the other movies. I don't think that matters too much.  agent_1:I like their relationshop in the movies. Chewy is a very loyal friend agent_2:In the canon Chewy has a family a wife and 2 sons.  agent_1:Thats interesting. I heard George RR Martin had an illustration that Chewie is based off of agent_2:I heard that too, it was on the cover of one of his small stories. It is a peculiar creature when you think about it.  agent_1:I wonder what other crazy creatures we could have had in space with Martins help. There's a giant fictional Universe that could be filled. agent_2:Would you like to  see a film with Chewbacca as the principal character ? 	agent_1:I think it would be interesting.

2925	agent_1:That sure is an interesting way to send off a family member. I guess they didn't want to falsely memorialize her. agent_2:I know, I couldnt ever imagine writing something like that about my family.  I guess I am lucky.   agent_1:I feel the same way. I would rather just keep it brief and impersonal if I had hard feelings rather than publicly attack them. agent_2:It is said that you shouldn't speak ill of the dead.  I wouldn't feel like I needed to have the last word. agent_1:On a more enjoyable and lighter topic, do you have any pets? I have a dog. agent_2:I don't.  I am not home very much.  But I do love animals.  I would think of myself as a cat person. agent_1:Unfortunately I am allergic to cats so while I enjoy them in small doses, I don't think I could ever own one. agent_2:I always think it would be cool to own an exotic pet, although Id never want a bear like Roosevelt had.   agent_1:I think he might be one of the few people who could pull off owning a bear. I would love to have one of the big cats as a pet but those are extremely dangerous as well. agent_2:There are actually more tigers living as pets in Asia than in the wild.  I never though people would seriously own them in masses. agent_1:I wonder if some of those are rescues and they are technically classified as pets. It would seem like there should be strict regulations to own one. agent_2:I agree.  I would be too scared to own something that could seriously eat me in my sleep, or any other time it pleased. agent_1:It's scary enough to think that my own dog probably is strong enough to harm me, let alone one of the top predators in the world. agent_2:Dogs do understand pointing, along with elephants.  They are the only two animals who have that instinct.  Id love a baby elephant, but they can get kinda big. agent_1:I've seen videos online where baby elephants interact with humans in a similar style to puppies. It's a definite bucket list experience for me! agent_2:Same here.  My girlfriend loves baby elephants, Ive tried to find a place we can go to have that experience.  I think it would be so cool, and a great surprise. agent_1:In looking some of those places up you want to find a place that is a rescue type facility. Unfortunately there are places that exploit the elephants and do not treat them well. agent_2:Definitely, not looking for somewhere they abuse the animals.  We're both big animal lovers.  I kind of like the philosophy in Boulder, CO where you can't own pets, but you are their guardian. agent_1:For me my pets have always been family. I care for them more than I do some people I know. agent_2:Definitely a lot more loyal and loving than people agent_1:She's also a lot more straightforward. She wants food, to be pet, more food, and to play with her ball. No guess work needed there.	agent_2:Very true.

Do you know the first movie King was ever scared by was Bambi? agent_2:That is hilarious!  I wonder why he would say that.   agent_1:I feel so happy for Jamie Lee Curtis for the success of Halloween agent_2:Yeah I would say that she is the face of that franchise for sure. 	agent_1:Researchers found that out of 1,100 films from 2007 to 2017, only 30% of the main characters were women	agent_2 likes movie. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'comedy', 'funny'].
4770	agent_1:It is amazing how a certain scent can ellict specific memories from throughout your life isn't it? agent_2:I know, I can catch a faint smell of something and be reminded of something from 20 years ago. agent_1:Yes, like a summer rain always reminds me of walking through the woods as a boy.  It's too bad we can't replicate those scents and be reminded of our childhood all of the time. agent_2:I've never thought about it, but I suppose we don't have names for smells, just where it comes from. agent_1:That's true I refer to a damp basement smell as moldy but why not refer to the smell of onions as 'yuk'? agent_2:It's difficult to imagine having names for each smell, as we have for colors.  I'd think there were too many. agent_1:Yes, but imagine if the defining term could relate to the listener not only what the smell was precisely but perhaps even it's location. Maybe other languages allow for more descriptive labels. agent_2:I suppose if you have to survive, partially because of your nose, it makes sense to be very specific. agent_1:I would think so. I suppose it has validity to convey something with just one word that lets everyone know everything about it. I think it might be difficult if you were to use a smell word with someone who had never smelled that scent before. agent_2:The Semaq Beri speakers take it seriously, especially with the brother and sister thing.  They'd struggle in the city. agent_1:Ha! They would indeed. It is funny how different cultures have taboos that make no sense to anyone but them. Whenever I smell a certain perfume I find myself back in time to my school days and the girl I used to love. agent_2:I guess we have the ability to use our noses in the same way, we just don't have the need.  There's not the peril for us. agent_1:True. Not many wild predators around to threaten us. It might be interesting to know their names for smells and try to correlate them into our culture, would they mean the same or not. agent_2:It seems it very specific to what you do, like the difference between horticulturists and hunter-gatherers. agent_1:Yes, and culture. If I say to you that an object smells like (.......), you would in all likelihood have a very good idea of what I'm referring to based on shared experience. agent_2:Avoiding mixing odors seems very extreme, I can't imagine cooking at home if I have to use different burner for each meat. agent_1:That would indeed be a hardship. When I cook I'm always using the simplest most direct way to get fed. A lot of the time that involves a can and one pot. agent_2:I wonder what they'd make of some of the exotic cuisines like Indian, Thai or Vietnamese cooking. agent_1:They would be adding to their dictionary I think. Some smells give me the willies, like fish. I hate the smell so whenever I walk into someone's home that has been cooking it I get sick to my stomach, so maybe they are on to something when they don't mix odors.  agent_2:Speaking of fish, did you know there was an immortal jellyfish? agent_1:I heard that but wonder how they determined it?	agent_2:Yeah, I guess there is no way to prove it.  A lot easier to prove a seahorse has  a neck	agent_1 likes fantasy. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['fantasy', 'entertainment', 'immortal jellyfish'].

I know that it can earn some people lots of money. agent_1:Well, let me inform you! They once used a helicopter to dry the grass for the 69 us open! agent_2:A helicopter? Well, I guess rich folk have all kind of resources at their disposal. Never needed to do that again, I guess. agent_1:I would have just had to tried to blow it dry with my breath. Would have taken forever! agent_2:They know how to think big in tennis, that's for sure. The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days. I wonder if anyone watched the whole thing. agent_1:They would have been sleepy after! Like I am after binge watching some netflix. agent_2:Netflix has fostered so much binge watching. People spend weekends immobile because of Netflix. agent_1:I know! hey have 137 million subscribers worldwide! THat's crazy! agent_2:The cash flow must be solid. They are expanding all the time, but still pay a lot in postage. I wonder why. agent_1:I wondered that too! They do make up half of internet traffic along with youtube!	agent_2:That's intense.

What does RBMG mean? agent_1:Taj Mahal is bigger than the white house. agent_2:Wow, I didn't know that, did you know the president's guest house is larger that the white house? What do you think about Robots? agent_1:i think president's guest house is small agent_2:I have lived in Washington DC and have never seen the guest house, but I was shock when I read upon it. Do you think it dangerous for men to built robots like human to go into dangerous places? agent_1:Definitely, it was very dangerous. agent_2:Did you know that Amazon ceo built a clock into the mountain that should run for 10,000 years? agent_1:Wow, it's wonderful. But i don't know. agent_2:Did you also know that the first Amazon.com first customer spent $27.95 got a building after him? that's something to think about. agent_1:I think the first customer was john wainwright. agent_2:Oh ok, did you know a single Google search required more computing power that It took to send Neil armstrong and eleven other astronauts to the moon?  agent_1:i don't know about it. agent_2:I don't either, do you used google alot? Is google one of your most used website for such as YouTube and maps? agent_1:Yes, i used google alot. It's very useful. agent_2:Chief executive founder of Anki robots want families to sit down and debate do they prefer a cat, dog or a robot. agent_1:Cozmo is not only a must-have toy for all kids aged 8 and up.

7001	agent_1:Did you hear about the 300 crocodiles killed in Indonesia? agent_2:Yeah I think that is sad. Us humans are invading these animals' space and we think we own the place. agent_1:I agree.  We dont even respect other humans, so animals definitely dont get any resepct.  We really need to treat every living thing with respect. agent_2:It's especially bad because it was a licensed sanctuary that Sugito wandered into to collect food. This was undoubtedly done without permission. agent_1:It is like when the kid fell into Harambe's cage.   agent_2:Right, I was mad about that one too. Police tried to stop the killings but there were 600 people so it was impossible. agent_1:That is horrible.  There are 20 quintillion (yeah that is a number) animals on earth and humans are one.  Id say we are slightly outnumbered. agent_2:Killing a protected species is a crime in Indonesia so it was just those people who were out of control. What's gross is the villagers took selfies with the crocodiles afterward.	agent_1:I would get killing the one, but trying to exterminate a species because of one bad one is stupid.	agent_2 dislikes environment. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['environment', 'environment', 'yes'].

I hear that is where it originated. agent_1:Yes, it did!! I have been there! You will love it! Lots of music and energy...It was developed from the blues and ragtime. agent_2:I guess Pakistan has a very good jazz orchestra. agent_1:Really, I didn't know they like Jazz, that's interesting! Did you know Jazz trumpeters like to wear a goatee? It gives comfort when playing. Makes sense. agent_2:I better not tell my son, or he will be trying to play my daughter's sax. Clint Eastwood is a jazz fan, and scored several films.	agent_1:Yes, I heard he is a lifelong pianist! Very cool..In Harlem, in a woman's apartment for 20 years she holds Jazz concerts.

How about you? agent_1:I do like her, specially her performance of the Reputation tour she had in Glendale. AZ agent_2:It seems like she and Kanye West have perpetual conflicts of one sort or the other.  First he crashed her award acceptance.  Then she is accused of stealing his music.  Social media was not kind to her over that accusation! agent_1:I think they were a bit unfair to her, it must be hard to be a celebrity, specially a really famous one like her agent_2:Well, they called her a ""snake"".  I like the way she turned it into a positive in her concert with imagery, a snake microphone, and a snake platform.  Snakes in general have an unwarranted bad reputation.  Do you have any experience with snakes? agent_1:No not really, but I love them many people are scared of them but I think they are interesting animals"	agent_2:I live in a rural area, so snakes are not uncommon.  I have a 4-5 foot common garter snake nesting at the base of my fig trees.  I like there because she eats the field mice and other critters who want my figs.  Too many people automatically assume snakes are poisonous.

Do you know that Lady Gaga is the godmother of Elton John's son? agent_2:Yes, shes tweeted about him a lot. You should follow her on twitter she has well over 11 million followers and posts all kinds of neat stuff. agent_1:I just recently followed her so I missed a lot. Speaking of, did you also know that the LAPD asked her to tweet her followers about some upcoming roadwork? agent_2:I guess they have a lot less followers. Smart idea! She's come a long way since she was on boiling points.	agent_1:I forgot that show existed. I had no idea she was on that.

2817	"agent_1:Are you familiar with Native American books? agent_2:I read a few in school.  I was raised in Oklahoma and many of my friends were of the Cherokee and Choctaw tribes.  I have heard of Tommy Orange's fiction novel about Native Americans. agent_1:That's interesting!  He is a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes.  I don't know much about those two tribes.  His book is about a boy? agent_2:Yes.  It is fiction however.  It provides insight into the challenges that the boy has in grappling with his identity.  We have a national history where many atrocities and slurs dot the history. agent_1:True!  I went to an indian reservation this past summer in New York.  It was the Seneca nation and I went through one of their museums.  They pretty much got kicked out of their land just like all the other tribes in the nation. agent_2:A people divided into tribes cannot stand against a unified enemy.  But, my wife's best friend has a Ph.D. and the government paid for all of her education because she is Cherokee.  But if one knows the facts, a lot of interesting history can be written. agent_1:Wow.  That's really interesting.  Hopefully Tommy Orange's book does well.   agent_2:Books can be fiction with a lot of facts or not so many.  Wiki has an article where they rank fictional characters according to their powers. agent_1:Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction in his youth.  Never knew that he did that before. agent_2:I wonder how one would find a copy of it.  Imagine Edgar Allen Poe wrote about a cyborg a long time ago agent_1:Interesting!  A judget ried to ban a science fiction comic in the 1950's because it featured a black character.  agent_2:Wow!  We have come a long way, thank goodness.  The FDA also burned 6 tons of literature in an act of censorship. agent_1:I think I remember reading about that before.  Literature was an olympic event from 1912 to 1952.  I would like to see one of those gold medals. agent_2:I would like to understand the scoring.  I bet it was somewhat like Jeopardy.  I would also like to read the ""best"" of the ""worst opening sentences"" that people used to enter into a contest. agent_1:lol  That would be interesting.  Didn't Sir Winston Churchill win a nobel prize for literature? agent_2:That would not be my first guess, but I think you are right!   Based on literature, kissing is a fairly recent development. agent_1:You would think that would have been written about a long time ago.  Switching gears ... id you know that Apple had a clothing line in 1986? agent_2:People did not wear brands on clothing so prominently as they do today back in 1986.  So that was Apple being innovative in another field."	agent_1:Surprisingly, the Pilgrims wore clothing that was full of color and they only wore black for special occasions.

I heard that Ursula K Le Guin who is known for her science fiction and fantasy novels, finshed a collection of poetry before her death. agent_1:Wow i did not know that. Did you know that Demetri Martin wrote a 224 word palindrome poem? agent_2:Interesting! Le Guin, in her poem ""Normal"" talks about not feeling bad to crush others to achieve goals. But the poem wanted to demonstrat that we should not let destructive attitudes prevail agent_1:ok. You know how much the famus author Edgar Allen poe received for the publication of the raven? agent_2:It was $9. Depressing! Speaking of depressing, there is one  poem that when read normally is depressing but read backwards is inspiring. agent_1:Wow that's one i would like to read. Have you ever seen the movie the hobbit? agent_2:I think I have. There is a book of poems by Emily Jungmin Yoon that seems quite depressing-it is about Korean comfort women in WWII in Japanese occupied territories. agent_1:Wow that most be a heart wrenching read. I asked about the hobbit because almost all the characters are named that were taken from an old Iceland poem Dvergatal."	agent_2:Nice.

Did you know that managers can actually play baseball? that's why they wear the uniforms, just in case the need arises, then they can play for the team agent_1:Yeah I did,  thats pretty awesome.  Hopefully they dont have to though,  most of them are a bit older.  Theres like 20 players on a team though,  shouldnt have the need.  agent_2:No I agree with you. Have you ever played kickball when you were in school? Apparently in Canada, it's not called kickball, it's called soccer baseball LOL agent_1:I did, used to love kickball,  I feel like kickball is a more appropriate name for it,  what does soccer mean? agent_2:I know right! I definitely think that kickball is the right word. It's the best way to describe it, what would you do if you found millions of dollars of baseball cards in your attic by the way? agent_1:Wow well pay off my car and cc's,  go on a small vacation and put the rest in savings or investments,  then continue my life.  how about you? agent_2:Haha I would do something similar. Definitely pay off my student loans and everything. And probably retire LOL. I can't believe that some guy found 3 million dollars worth of those cards in his grandfather's attic though. What a lucky guy agent_1:I know thats amazing.  That would be really nice,  my relatives dont collect anything cool like that so Im on my own lol 	agent_2:Haha yes that's too bad, mine did not either. Have you ever been to Japan by the way?

I like Edgar Allen Poe. I know watching horror movies can burn up to 180 calories! agent_1:Interesting. So instead of going to the gym, you just sit there and watch the movies?  agent_2:Right! Did you know Bambi terrified Stephen King. agent_1:I'm not surprised, Bambi does die in the end.  agent_2:I'm glad. I know if you watch a horror movie before you view abstract art you will enjoy the art more. agent_1:Interesting, any type of specific artists, or just abstract art?  agent_2:I think just abstract art.  agent_1:Ok, I wonder why that is. Any ideas as to why this occurs?  agent_2:None at all. It's hard to believe Danny the boy from the shining did not know he was acting in horror film. agent_1:Interesting. I didn't know that. Did you know that they have fantasy draft spelling bees?  agent_2:No, I did not. A single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving reality and fantasy.

I don't know if you like jelly fish or not but there is one that is immortal agent_1:Yeah, I've heard that. I'm not sure how that is possible.  agent_2:Right, what if you blend it or do other things to it, it just won't die? agent_1:I'm not sure. It will probably die.

10277	agent_1:I just read a section on comedy which states that the python program was partly named after Monty Python. I love how they did that! agent_2:Yeah the programming language I think is what you mean. Classic comedy. Kung Fu Hustle is a brilliant comedy also. agent_1:I've actually never seen it, whats it about?  agent_2:It's a wacky cartoony slapstick comedy. Bill Murray loves the movie too. agent_1:i'll add it to my list of movies to watch. Bill Murray is such a great comedian, unfortunately I don't think he's been in movies as of late. Green lantern is on my list of movies to watch too, weird to think that it was initially going to be a comedy agent_2:Yeah I think Jack Black was supposed to star. Hard to believe that 3rd Rock beat Seinfeld for best comedy in '97 at the golden globes agent_1:I've actually never even seen an episode of 3rd rock. Seinfeld was revolutionary, are you more of a Seinfeld or Friends fan? agent_2:Seinfeld by far. Friends doesn't hold up very well for me. I wonder if it would have been one of the 100 shows Comedy Central cancelled over the years if it had been on that channel. You? Friends or Seinfeld? agent_1:perhaps! I'm actually more of a Friends fan myself lol. It's interesting how much tv shows and movies have changed over the years. Even just through more advanced filming abilities and styles. Shout out to James Wong for pioneering the use of wide-angle lenses amongst other things agent_2:He was quite the pioneer despite the racism. agent_1:he had a lot to overcome and still won an Oscar. I've read in other articles that the Oscars are pretty racist too, not recognizing talented individuals due to their race.  agent_2:There are definitely some problems. A woman has never won best cinematographer, or even been nominated. agent_1:that's some crazy stuff. It even must be frustrating with Roger Daekins for being nominated 13 times and never having won	agent_2:And the guy who was supposed to be the cinematographer for Spartacus didn't actually do the work and won the academy award.	agent_1 likes movie. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'TV shows', 'actor'].

I was surprised there a website for people with couches to crash on, wish I knew it last week I had a long layover. agent_1:Whoa that's awesome! Did you eat crepes? I want to go to Iceland but it sounds like the public transport isn't great-will probably rent a car. agent_2:No crepes, I did have snails which I like. I've had a layover in Iceland, it looks like the moon. Flying it a lot of volcanic lava flows turned to rock. Did you know about that gnome stealing thing, take a picture, then return? That a lot of work. agent_1:Haha yeah I heard about that. Does sound like a lot of work. Did you fly any domestic flights in Iceland? That seems like a good way to get around there. agent_2:No, Iceland Air is cheapest to Sweden, I work there a couple times a year. I'm on the east coast so it's a quick flight though. Do you like fiction, a reader? That how I bide my time. agent_1:Awesome lucky. Yeah fiction is entertaining. I like it because it is not based strictly on history or fact. agent_2:Yes, I'm not much on Science Fiction, more literary fiction. I didn't know Isaac Asimov coined ""robotics"" I have friends who  love him and Sci Fi. What genre do you like? agent_1:Oh nice good genre. I like fiction as well. Edgar Allen Poe's first developed cyborg's in fiction which is pretty cool.  agent_2:Yes and Poe developed the detective genre I read too. I read War and Peace, but the Smash Bros is 4 million words even longer? That would take some time. agent_1:Wow. Is War and Peace good? I know Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction but I have never read his text. agent_2:Yes, I liked it but it's a complex novel. Yes, I read Caesar history of the Gallic Wars. Pretty interesting in light of France now. Do you like music, you see where the highest violin bow price sold for $182,000 wow, that quite expensive per pound. agent_1:You have read a lot I'm impressed. I love music and sometimes classical. Hard to believe a violin sold for that. Hopefully it wasn't the one made out of stone! agent_2:Gold and tortoiseshell i read, I feel sorry for the turtle. You like fiddle or violin more? Country or classic as the instrument is the same. agent_1:Wow. Interesting. I like the fiddle because I prefer country music. A famous scientist who played the violin was Albert Einstein. agent_2:Interesting, complex man. Did you know they have to play and ""break-in"" a violin? That makes sense though interesting it changes the cellulose molecules in the body. agent_1:Kind of like a shoe? Very interesting. It is also good for the small muscles and nerves of the arms and hands. Just ask Larry Fine from the Three stooges! agent_2:That funny, yes, you like me must have a few years on you. My kids don't know who the Three Stoogies are. Have you traveled much? Back to that, you see where the airlines make the walk longer instead of baggage return quicker to cut complaints. That not good to me."	agent_1:Yes I have lived in both Spain and Australia. I actually didn't hear about that.

It thought that the 2 would be a lot different form each other.  agent_1:Apparently both planets have come similarities, I wonder if they will find ancient life on the planet, the 2020 mission seems like a chance to gather a lot of intel about the planet agent_2:The atmospheres have similar aerodynamic characteristics, maybe ancient Mars was a little like Earth.  agent_1:Thats an interesthing theory, I think thats possibly, did you hear about the Curiosity rover? agent_2:The Curiosity rover that landed on Mars in 2012 ?

Dolphins are already smarter then us so how could aliens not exist agent_2:I so believe we'll eventually find some.  But, I feel kind of like Stephen Hawking, it's dangerous to be communicating with them. agent_1:But what if people like stephan hawking understood things we dont' he is on another level of intelligence kind of like elon musk they are the human versions of aliens with their brains agent_2:I agree with you about that.  If we found some aliens, I'd say let's watch them for a good long time before any attempts at communication and they probably feel the same way about communicating with us. agent_1:Exactly if aliens wanted to harm us they could have easily already have done it, they don't want to interfere with us we shouldn't interfere with them agent_2:I agree, there's something to it, though when the UN has a contigency plan in place should aliens ever attempt to contact the Earth.  So, somebody knows something, they just can't alert the masses and create panic around the world. agent_1:So true and don't you find it wierd how drones were first military technology and then a couple of years later it becomes available to the public. Where did the military steal their ideas from drone technology from? agent_2:The same place they stole a whole bunch of their other ""ideas"".

If you think about it, a lot of power comes from water.  agent_2:Yes such as hydropower. Apple computer's seem to be quite sensitive because if you smoke near an Apple Computer it voids the warranty. agent_1:Interesting. That doesn't sound true, but I wonder if it is the same for the iphone? agent_2:I don't know what you mean? There is a group called transhumanist's that want to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks! agent_1:That sounds pretty cool. I would do it, would you?  agent_2:I don't know sounds kind of creepy to me! Almost like the work of fiction! Like something from someones imagination! agent_1:I think it would be pretty cool.

As of October 2018, Netflix has 137 million total subscribers worldwide, including 58.46 million in the United States. Amazing! agent_2:I know, a lot of people subscribe to the service, still Netflix has a huge deficit agent_1:I guess they have been spending tons of money. I know that Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth. agent_2:I wonder why? isnt there whole business model online? agent_1:I guess some parts of the country have little bandwidth. People need DVDs and such. Still, many online users. From 9pm to 12am, Netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in north america. agent_2:So Netflix also has the DVD service, interesting, I guess every subscriber counts, still seems a bit excessive, 20 more times!!!! and wow 33% really? agent_1:It seems to work. Netflix is now worth $2 billion. agent_2:They have $21.9 billion in debt, not sure if its a giant anymore, theres also new streaming services out there that are a threat to Netflix agent_1:I expect them to have competitors. After racking up a $40 late fee on a vhs copy of Apollo 13, Reed Hastings was inspired to start netflix. Someone else will get inspired to take on Netflix. agent_2:Blockbuster gave Reed the knife then, they did charge excessive fees.	agent_1:Probably a big part of their business model. Then they thought they could beat Netflix at the online game. Now they're gone!

12701	"agent_1:I am not a fan of Mitch McConnell.  The senate majority leader has gone somewhat nuts. agent_2:Good afternoon, I try to avoid the political shenanigans.  It's just one shyster trying to get something over on the other guy, all the time.   agent_1:Yes but even in 2016 the CIA was meeting with senior congressional leaders over the fact that Putin had authorized an operation to destabilize our election agent_2:That's Putin for you, he's going to do that, hard to believe it took the CIA needing to tell them he was doing it.  I'm sure all of our ""frenemies""  do the same thing and we do it to them, too. agent_1:Yes but it is scary that McConnell is denying the evidence and claiming that it is just a scheme by the CIA to discredit Trump.  He does not believe all of our national security agencies. agent_2:On a different and much happier note than all that crazy political mess, do you realize the consistent use of the red and blue colors for Republicans and Democrats only started in 2000?  That's probably about the time it started to get real ugly in politics. agent_1:Yes that is crazy but it has been ugly for a while - Harry Truman visited disneyland and refused to be photographed on the dumbo ride because it might associate him with republicans! agent_2:You know the voter turnout for a US presidential election hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years.  I'm going to be watching 2020, I think Trump can break that! agent_1:Certainly he has 60 percent of the country who think he is doing a horrible job so it might increase the turnout!  Too bad we can't have third parties - there has not been one elected since 1853"	agent_2:Actually, I think there are that many that WANT to vote for him and are going to turn out to vote against whatever candidate the Dems throw up there.  That third party thing has never seemed to work out too well, a shame.	agent_1 dislikes election. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['election', 'politics', 'no'].

It's a real shame how much water is wasted per day on each course, though. It's over 300,000 gallons a day a course! agent_2:True, but consider that golf courses in America combined are larger than the size of two small US states! agent_1:Yeah, golf must be pretty popular in that case. Did you know there exists a golf course in Dubai that uses around 4 million gallons a day? That must cost a lot of money. agent_2:I suppose that comes with games that cannot and do not utilize a standardized playing area agent_1:You know what games do utilize a standardized playing area? Baseball and softball. The fields are pretty similar. agent_2:Interesting.    Babe Ruth was both a famous golfer and baseball player! agent_1:Speaking of famous people who play sports, Samuel L. Jackson actually plays golf twice a week during filming of whatever he's in. agent_2:Cool.    Did you know Jose canseco claims to hold the record for longest softball homerun at 622 feet	agent_1:Woah, that's really far! Softball players don't make a lot of money.

8975	"agent_1:Hi There ! Looking forward to chat with You ! ;) agent_2:Hello! Good i just read some really interesting stuff about Jazz music. Did you know it started in the great city of New Orleans? agent_1:Yes, I believe I was aware of that fact. Are You a jazz lover ? agent_2:I am! It is a great style some people consider it America's classical music today. agent_1:Yes sir... I love how every song and solo can sound totally different - even when played by the same musician... agent_2:Yes it is truly something. I have heard that New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s. agent_1:That I'm not sure about... don't know the exact date, but I always wondered how a music style begins... it's not like a guy is sitting on it's porch and thinks... ""I'm going to invent new music style and I'll call it JAZZ"" :) agent_2:Haha! Yeah i have always wondered things like that. But I have heard that Clint eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast who knew huh? agent_1:I can believe that... he is a classy Dude ;) I don't imagine him listening to disco or rap ;) agent_2:Yeah he just does not seem like the guy that would be into that. But I think more people love jazz than we know A harlem woman has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every sunday for 20 years. agent_1:I'm sure there were a lot of enthusiasts of that ! Sounds like a good woman  agent_2:Yeah what kind of stuff is on your mind that you would like to talk about? agent_1:You know Edgar allen poe poetry ? agent_2:I am he was a fiction writer correct? agent_1:Yes - really dark poetry sometimes -  He wrote wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction. Pretty interesting ! ;) agent_2:Yeah he was a special kinda person, If i recall he was the person who also wrote the poem about  the raven crying nevermore. agent_1:Yes I think You're right.

Did you know the cat used in the opening scene of The Godfather was actually a stray they found on set? I thought that was pretty cool! agent_1:Oh that is super cool. From rags to riches. A cats life must be nice. They spend over half their life sleeping! agent_2:That us true. Ha! I would like to visit one of those cat cafes over in Japan that lets you pay by the hour to drink and play with cats! I bet that's so interesting! agent_1:That would be fun! Also there is a town in Alaska that has a cat mayor! agent_2:Is that so? That's a little odd! Ha! Did you ever hear about the physicist that published his cat as coauthor so he could avoid criticism by writing in first person plural? agent_1:Haha I never knew about that. However I also like dogs too. They were the first species to be domesticated! agent_2:I love dogs as well! It's crazy only dogs and elephants are the only animals that can understand pointing, isn't it? agent_1:Yeah I agree I would think more animals would understand that. Google also prefers dogs to cats which is kind of funny that they declare such a thing.	agent_2:I know, right?

1280	"agent_1:There was man who was falsely imprisoned. He used the prison library to study law and learn to free himself. That is amazing don't you think? agent_2:That is awesome! Speaking of libraries, there are more libraries than McDonalds in the United States. Do you have a library card? agent_1:I do and that is good to hear. Also, half of adult have library cards that seems like more than I would have thought. agent_2:I know. I don't know that a lot of my friends go to the library. The Sacramento Library has instituted a type of library that might make going to the library more interesting to many. They started a library of things, so you can check out sewing machines and other things that you don't need to own for a long time. agent_1:That would be so useful. I wonder if other cities do that? I know that normal library collections often included DVD's and CD's and other things besides books. agent_2:Yes, and I have also checked out passes to various museums in my city. I'm glad some people were dedicated to starting libraries in the past as they have been so useful to me. Have you heard of UK Prime Minister William Gladstone? agent_1:I have. I heard that he started a library in 1895 with 32,000 books in it. All from his personal collection. Can you imagine? agent_2:The more amazing thing to me is how he carted all those books by wheelbarrow over 3/4 mile. He was 85! agent_1:Maybe his daughter helped him. I wonder how many were Shakespeare plays. I was reading one at the library. Did you know that Shakespear coined many of the terms we use today, including ""good riddance"" and ""laughing stock?"" agent_2:Oh, that's interesting. I would never have thought as luck would have it, break the ice, and full circle were from Shakespeare. agent_1:I guess it makes sense that he coined so many terms since he was the world's greatest dramatist. Plus, he wrote so much. He wrote 39 plays! agent_2:Not only did he coin terms, but he created names. The names Miranda, Olivia and Jessica were invented by Shakespeare. I didn't know those names went so far back! agent_1:That is interesting. I wonder if these names sound different with the accent of the time. I know the accent can affect the meaning of the performance. The old accent can introduce rhymes or puns that don't work with our modern tongue. What might Miranda sound like in Shakespeare's voice? agent_2:That is an interesting thought. Shakespeare has been translated into every major language. I wonder how they preserve Shakespeare's style and language in other languages. agent_1:That is a good question. It would be interesting to study that in school. I bet people use to study Shakespeare in school more than they do now. I hear that people often studied the Bible in school before 1963. agent_2:Yes, the Bible does still play a large role in our lives though. Presidents are still sworn in with them. I wonder why Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams did not use Bibles at their swearing in ceremonies. agent_1:That is true. It does play a role still. Plus it was influenced by real history. For example, the tower of Babel was probably based on a real building in what is now Iraq. agent_2:Thomas Jefferson didn't seem to agree with all parts of the Bible. He made his own version and cut out the supernatural parts. I wonder why that was. agent_1:Interesting!. All so at least three Presidents saw the Bible differently (Jefferson, Roosevelt and Adams.) Iti is interesting to think about how the Bible changes too. For example, the apple from Adam and Eve was a translation from the 4th century. agent_2:That's true. And different Bible canons have evolved over the century with overlapping contents but also diverging contents."	agent_1:Yes. In fact, the what is seen as canonical depends on the traditions of different groups.	agent_2 likes TV shows. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV shows', 'hobby', 'reading'].
7013	agent_1:Did you hear about the 300 crocodiles killed in Indonesia? agent_2:Yeah I think that is sad. Us humans are invading these animals' space and we think we own the place. agent_1:I agree.  We dont even respect other humans, so animals definitely dont get any resepct.  We really need to treat every living thing with respect. agent_2:It's especially bad because it was a licensed sanctuary that Sugito wandered into to collect food. This was undoubtedly done without permission. agent_1:It is like when the kid fell into Harambe's cage.   agent_2:Right, I was mad about that one too. Police tried to stop the killings but there were 600 people so it was impossible. agent_1:That is horrible.  There are 20 quintillion (yeah that is a number) animals on earth and humans are one.  Id say we are slightly outnumbered. agent_2:Killing a protected species is a crime in Indonesia so it was just those people who were out of control. What's gross is the villagers took selfies with the crocodiles afterward. agent_1:I would get killing the one, but trying to exterminate a species because of one bad one is stupid. agent_2:Yeah, and I still don't think it's bad because the villager wandered into its habitat. But some people did question the logic of having crocodile ponds so close to a village. agent_1:Or rather building a village close to where the animals already live. agent_2:What about the Disney World alligator? Did you hear about that one? agent_1:I vaguely remember something about that, what was the deal with it again? agent_2:There was a sign that said stay away from the water but the parents let him get too close to the pond. He was scooping up water into a pail when he was snatched. Poor kid. agent_1:I remember that now.  I feel bad, it is just awareness. Some people have none agent_2:Yeah, I heard that he was also playing in the water. And in this case they euthanized the alligator and humanely removed others. agent_1:Removal I can deal with, only if we were not intruding on their initial home. agent_2:Yeah well I guess Disney World built where there were already alligators naturally. Seems pretty ineivitable in many areas of Florida that we would intrude. Sigh. I feel bad for the boy but the crocodile was probably just acting in its nature because it's a carnivore. agent_1:Thinking like this little snack wandered into my home, how nice.   agent_2:Right.:/ And as humans we make handbags of alligators all the time.

The country is a crazy place lately.  agent_1:I agree. There hasn't been a US president who wasn't a rep or dem since 1853. agent_2:Wow, I guess that doesn't surprise me lol. Did you know the use of RED and BLUE for each party color only began in 2000? Weird agent_1:Oh wow I didn't know that. I saw that Ronald Reagan compaiged for democrats. agent_2:That's odd, he wasn't a Democrat, interesting. i didn't know that. agent_1:Very interesting I think. 15% of the tea party movement identify themselves as democrats. agent_2:Interesting! I was watching a vlog on Youtube who was talking about how many people are not Democrats or Republicans. I agree in that because I don't identify as either. agent_1:Did you know Fox News threatened to sue the Simpsons one time? agent_2:Oh, wasn't that about trying to stop them from parodying the anti democratic agenda? agent_1:Possibly lol. Do you like YouTube? agent_2:I love Youtube....I am always looking there or Google to do so many things! agent_1:I watch YouTube daily. YouTube is the second largest search engine on the internet. agent_2:That doesn't surprise me.

King Zeno is one hell of a scary novel, not apt for everyone agent_1:For sure, it is about a century old but still so scary. Do you like to listen to jazz music? agent_2:I love it yeah, what about you? do you like the genre agent_1:Not a huge fan but a fan of the historic value of jazz, there's so many types of jazz like swing, Kansas City Jaz, and Gypsy jazz.

They had been stashed away since the 1940s.  agent_2:I could only imagine how exciting that was. My cards were from the late 1980s and 1990s, there were a lot of sets made then. I bet there were a lot less made in the 1900s. agent_1:I don't know actually.  The weird thing about baseball is that it's america's national pastime but it is super popular in Japan of all places. agent_2:I know that a few countries in Asia have really taken up baseball. A lot of former MLB players play in Korea as well. agent_1:I've heard that before.  Japan likes it so much that they are actually shocked to learn that it comes from america. agent_2:That surprises me because after World War 2 they have become a lot more open to Western culture and adopting some of our styles and customs. agent_1:It is surprising.  Speaking of surprising, did you know that the reason the managers wear uniforms is so they can go in the game if needed? agent_2:In previous years some players played a dual role as a manager as well.

I don't have a telescope that is all the powerful though. I imagine mine is more like Galileo's telescope.  Do you have plans?	agent_1:Not so much yet.

It is not like the republican party of old times. agent_1:Yeah a lot of things have changed, funny anecdote with Truman and Dumbo though	agent_2:That is a good one.  Poor Dumbo.  He probably didnt realize what was happening.

246	"agent_1:I think its sad to have to part with a pet due to allergies and couple conflict like in the Dear Amy section. agent_2:That is sad. Do you have pets? The first cloned pet was a cat and its name was copy cat. agent_1:Yes, I have a dog.  Sounds like in the Dear Amy that they do everything tit for tat. The cat owner states that her fiance has to get rid of his saltwater fish if she gets rid of her cat.  That's not necessarily fair though I don't think.  They seem like they may struggle as a couple in the future. agent_2:Yeah that's a bit dramatic! A cat lover is known as an ailurophile and a dog lover is known as a cynophile. agent_1:Allergies can be serious to people.  I understand his reserve of having a cat. agent_2:Me too. A pet or companion animal is an animal kept primarily for a person's company, protection, or entertainment. No one should have to be made uncomfortable by a pet in the house. agent_1:I'm sure she loves the pet, but she has to make a choice if the pet is harming her fiance. agent_2:Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described. I'm sure they can find one to agree on.  agent_1:Did you ever hear that animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated?  That's a new one to me.   agent_2:That's interesting! Of the 1.5 million species, 1 million are insects! Yuck! agent_1:Apparently, there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.  If you want to live forever, you can look into being a jellyfish. agent_2:Fascinating! In japan, there are more pets than there are children under 15. agent_1:Teddy Roosevelt had over 20 pets and his own real ""teddy"" bear along with a hyena agent_2:Wow! There are more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia. agent_1:I never met anyone with a tiger pet.  That is strange.  It's not legal to own pets in Boulder, Colorado but you can be their guardian. agent_2:Lots of places have special animal rights. In 2002, germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights."	agent_1:The loch ness monster is protected by 1912 Scottish provisions	agent_2 likes monster. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['monster', 'animals', 'pets'].

I loved the song what's love got to do with it. agent_2:That's a really good song as so is ""Proud Mary."" agent_1:Yeah i like that one too along with nutbush. agent_2:Did you ever read her first memoir ""I, Tina?"" agent_1:I have not but i did see that movie it was riveting.  agent_2:I haven't seen it nor read the book.

2920	agent_1:That sure is an interesting way to send off a family member. I guess they didn't want to falsely memorialize her. agent_2:I know, I couldnt ever imagine writing something like that about my family.  I guess I am lucky.   agent_1:I feel the same way. I would rather just keep it brief and impersonal if I had hard feelings rather than publicly attack them. agent_2:It is said that you shouldn't speak ill of the dead.  I wouldn't feel like I needed to have the last word. agent_1:On a more enjoyable and lighter topic, do you have any pets? I have a dog. agent_2:I don't.  I am not home very much.  But I do love animals.  I would think of myself as a cat person. agent_1:Unfortunately I am allergic to cats so while I enjoy them in small doses, I don't think I could ever own one. agent_2:I always think it would be cool to own an exotic pet, although Id never want a bear like Roosevelt had.   agent_1:I think he might be one of the few people who could pull off owning a bear. I would love to have one of the big cats as a pet but those are extremely dangerous as well. agent_2:There are actually more tigers living as pets in Asia than in the wild.  I never though people would seriously own them in masses. agent_1:I wonder if some of those are rescues and they are technically classified as pets. It would seem like there should be strict regulations to own one. agent_2:I agree.  I would be too scared to own something that could seriously eat me in my sleep, or any other time it pleased. agent_1:It's scary enough to think that my own dog probably is strong enough to harm me, let alone one of the top predators in the world. agent_2:Dogs do understand pointing, along with elephants.  They are the only two animals who have that instinct.  Id love a baby elephant, but they can get kinda big. agent_1:I've seen videos online where baby elephants interact with humans in a similar style to puppies. It's a definite bucket list experience for me! agent_2:Same here.  My girlfriend loves baby elephants, Ive tried to find a place we can go to have that experience.  I think it would be so cool, and a great surprise.	agent_1:In looking some of those places up you want to find a place that is a rescue type facility. Unfortunately there are places that exploit the elephants and do not treat them well.	agent_2 likes rescue. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['rescue', 'pets', 'dog'].
13159	agent_1:hello! how are you doing? What did you think of the article? agent_2:Not exactly one I've ever thought about for sure. agent_1:I figured we could just start by looking at the first section here. I found it really interesting about using robots to prepare Mars for human arrival. agent_2:I'd feel a lot better in a way sending robots up first to test things. But, what robots do not have are human emotions that would have to deal with such a bizarre plan. agent_1:Sorry for the delay. I was reading ahead and got distracted. I totally agree with you on that. The idea that we may only be 20 to 25 years away is crazy to me. agent_2:I just really don't see the point from what I've read here. Why travel so far to go to somewhere that has nothing to offer a human? Can't you just move to a different destination right here on Earth? Seems an awful lot to go through just to get away...no? agent_1:No it totally makes sense. I think the appeal is going somwhere we have never gone before. Still, it seems easier to make the earth more inhabitable than to move to another planet entirely. There are many areas of earth that we could spread to if we invested this level of effort. agent_2:Yep.....the Sahara desert comes to mind. As far as it making sense, I suppose, to those explorers out there who'd like that sort of thing. agent_1:Yes for sure. It is just such an interesting concept. To me it is just crazy the amount of time money and planning that goes into this kind of project. agent_2:Well, being alone and 61 years old, I'm willing to give it a shot, I would just be overly concerned about boredom! What to do with all that time on a different planet? agent_1:Right exactly. I have no idea how I would occupy myself. agent_2:That is why I'm sure the scientists would have to put those willing through plenty of tests to see how they would handle such a change. Like I said before, sending robots first is an excellent idea. But, they can't measure a person's mind dealing with it with robots. Can they? agent_1:No and I think that is the biggest issue we don't know on this type of journey. The physical toll would be intense yes, but the mental toll may be unimaginable until someone is put through it. agent_2:I would think that travelling with many other people that are alike would be of some comfort. You know, many people not knowing what their future will bring will certainly give it's way to plenty of conversation topics. But, for that long?  agent_1:Right exactly. I mean you may exhaust everything just on the journey itself, and likely there would be an almost non-existent shot at returning. agent_2:That is why I'm interested in why the scientists are even interested in pursuing this. I think that people would just feel better spending time on Earth than risking everything on something so ludicris? agent_1:I totally agree. As I said I think at the beginning there are just so many options on Earth that we could explore before doing anything else. agent_2:I think that perhaps the scientists should think of different ways to spend all that money! Or at least, put themselves or real astronauts through this ordeal before allowing the general public to go through it. In that way, they can make sure that a human mind can handle it. But, then again, it would be astronauts doing it, and their minds are of a different psychiatric character agent_1:Yeah I am wondering if there are ways to truly simulate this without endangering anyone in the process. Possibly doing a long desert of arctic based mission in preparation?	agent_2:That's a good idea you have! You can send people to the Arctic, Antarctic, or like I said the Sahara desert which would challenge a human's mind. They are just as desolate as the planet Mars, yet cheaper to get to.	agent_1 likes travel. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['travel', 'astronomy', 'robotics'].
4553	agent_1:Earth never stops to amaze me, it was formed over 4.5 billion years ago and there is still much to learn about our planet agent_2:I know what you mean.  It is the only object known to have life and we need to know why that is. agent_1:I agree, we must find life in other planets if we want to survive as a species, its sad how 80% of the forests have been destroyed by now agent_2:That is definitely sad and very troubling.  It makes me wonder what will happen to the polar regions with all of the ice. agent_1:Global Warming happened to them and if we dont start caring about our planet we might need to find another one soon. agent_2:Already things are changing.  Did you know that there will be no helium on the planet by the end of this century?  Not only are we losing plants and animals but now we are losing elements. agent_1:I did not know that, I wonder how that will affect us, im sure it will have hidden consequences on life on earth and to think we account to only a small portion of earths history agent_2:I imagine it will have consequences too.  I've heard that when the earth was first formed a day was only just over 5 hours long.  That would be weird.  I guess that means the planet used to be closer to the sun? agent_1:Yeah, it seems that way, or maybe rotated at a bigger speed, you know we  have an embassador in case aliens arrive to the planet or try to make contact with us.	agent_2:I didn't know that!  That's actually pretty cool!  I hope he or she is friends with Elon Musk. At the rate he is going, he'll find life before the government does.

Did you ever watch Big Hero 6? agent_2:I have, it was an excellent movie. What about you? agent_1:I liked it a lot, I never knew it was Disney too much while watching it, apparently it was rendered with a 55,000 core supercomputer	agent_2:Talk about high tech!

8547	agent_1:Hi there do you have an iPhone or an Android? agent_2:Hi, I have an iPhone. Do you know when the first one was released? agent_1:Yeah that was back on 2007, seems so long ago now agent_2:I know it sure does. Among users, women are more likely to own one than men agent_1:Oh cool fact. Microsoft in fact held a funeral to mark the death of the iPhone when they launched theirs agent_2:Wow that did not work very well because the iPhone has had tremendous sales agent_1:Exactly. Have you heard of the game send me to heaven? agent_2:I did, and Apple banned it because people were supposed to throw the phones as high as possible and risked damaging them  agent_1:That is so stupid. When Steve Jobs presented it first he has identical ones hidden because they kept crashing agent_2:Yeah it kept running our of ram and that is why it crashed. Those days are over though agent_1:They sure are. Do you listen to the radio much? agent_2:Yes I listen to Pandora Radio. How about you? agent_1:Yes me too. Their net income is $-16 million and the revenue is $274 million agent_2:Wow that is so strange. Now they are streaming stand up comedy. agent_1:That is nice they are diversifying their stream. When Swift removed her music from iTunes she still kept it in Pandora agent_2:Maybe that means more of her fans moving over to Pandora, so that is good revenue right there agent_1:Yeah that is true. Have you ever played Nintendo? agent_2:I have actually. Did you know it only had 54 colors? agent_1:Wow that is it? Too bad it got discontinued in Japan in 2003 though agent_2:That  is true, I have some fond memories of it.

Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer? agent_1:I heard that, winning Cha Cha championships and everything! agent_2:Yes that is amazing. He won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship back in 1958 in fact. agent_1:I always just thought of him as a martial arts legend.  Now he is a dance legend of sorts too! agent_2:Yeah!! That is correct. He was a fantastic martial artist. Did you know that Tupac danced ballet in high school? agent_1:Yeah!  He was the mouse king in the Nutcracker.  Thats pretty cool, I would definitely never have guessed that about him. agent_2:Neither did I. That is insane because Tupac was a famous rapper.  agent_1:He was indeed, his music is even in the library of congress. agent_2:I didn't know this thanks for sharing. agent_1:Sure thing!  Did you hear about Michael Jackson's special patent shoes? agent_2:No. I know that Michael Jackson was a fantastic dancer but can you tell me more about his patent shoes if you don't mind. agent_1:There was a specific device in his shoes that helped with his extreme lean in some dance moves. agent_2:Wow!!! That is amazing coming from such a talented singer and dancer. I couldn't even dance like that even if I dreamed of it. agent_1:Me neither. I could never be a professional dancer. agent_2:I heard that some professional ballet dancer can go through four pairs of shoes in a week. agent_1:That is crazy!  That can't be cheap for them. agent_2:No. I think its very expensive for them to be professional ballet dancers based on this. agent_1:It has been great chatting but I must go!  Gotta go get my Bruce Lee on, the martial arts part...  definitely not the dance.	agent_2:Ha Ha!!! It was so nice chatting with you as well!! Have a nice day!!!

What do you think about them? agent_1:Not much. Did you know there is a jellyfish that is immortal?  agent_2:I would not want to cross paths with that. I think there has to be something that could kill it. agent_1:I'm not sure, I don't think that can be real, can it?  agent_2:I don't think so, maybe I will look it up lol. One thing I wouldnt cross either is the black swallower fish, have you heard of that one? agent_1:Me either. What about shoes, any interest?  agent_2:I love my shoes! I like nike mostly, how about you agent_1:I'm more of an adidas fan, but I have some Nikes.  agent_2:Did you ever have the stephon marbury shoes back in the day? agent_1:No, but I had some air jordans?  agent_2:Nice, I love air jordans. The marbury shoes were sold at Steve and Berrys for like 15 dollars each. They both don't exist anymore agent_1:Wow, that is pretty cheap, is that on an inflation adjusted basis?  agent_2:I am sure they are more costly now on ebay since they are so rare.

2413	agent_1:Hi, how are you? agent_2:Great! Did you know that Oscar Isaac requested that his character in The Force Awakens be from Yavin 4, because he's from Guatemala and that's where the Yavin 4 scenes were shot in the original trilogy? agent_1:I did not know that! I was also shocked to learn that George Lucas's wife won an emmy while he did not. agent_2:Huh, he didn't win an Emmy for the Star War Christmas special? Haha. In 2013 Star Wars was the first film to be dubbed into a Native American language -- Navajo.  agent_1:I find it sad that this was not done until 2013. Don't you think it should have been earlier than that? agent_2:You would think. It is sad. For the original Star Wars movie, James Earl jones only got paid $7500 and recorded all of his lines in just 2 and a half hours. Talk about a bargain.  agent_1:Yeah! That does work out to a great hourly rate though. The total value of the star wars franchise is $65B! agent_2:And that's after they studio thought it was going to flop, so Lucas gave up his $500k directing fee in return for licensing and merchandising rights. Maybe one of the best business decisions ever made! agent_1:Yeah! Do you know what he sold to Disney for? How much??? agent_2:Seems like it was over a billion. Back to Lucas's wife -- she had a lot of the best ideas for the original movie, like Obi Wan's death.  agent_1:I cried when I saw that part. Still makes me sad. She also suggested Leia's good luck kiss... agent_2:And re-edited the trench run scene to make it more suspenseful. Those are some big contributions. Much deserving of the editing Oscar.  agent_1:I agree. I think star wars is getting too watered down, with average movies like Solo and New Hope. They were ok movies but not up to the quality we have come to know about the franchise.	agent_2:Totally agree. I did LOVE the spin-off Rogue One though from 2016. That one felt like a true Star Wars movie from back i the day. 	agent_1 likes movie. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'greeting', 'movie'].

Seen so many of his films.  agent_1:Yes you are right, have you seen E.T? if yes, did you like the movie, I know it's an old movie. agent_2:Yes it is an old movie. I like older movies. I remember when the game for the atari came out, they literally had to mass dump the product  in a field somewhere. agent_1:Yes I heard about that, but I wonder if the atari could have been recycle, just to think about all those Items were destroyed. agent_2:Yeah. its funny that he made all these movies here for all humans to see. Here on planet earth. A 4.5 million year old rock. I wonder if aliens seen our movies?  agent_1:yes you are right, I really like all the Jurassic Parks, I have watched those movies several times. agent_2:Dude!!! Tell me about it. Its crazy that Tom hanks made so much money. Making 8,5 billion worldwide and wasnt in any of the sagas. not in star wars and not in jurassic park. agent_1:Yes Tom Hanks made a lot of money also, did you know Steven Spielberg played the clarinet in jaws? agent_2:That is so cool how invlolved he is. I read that a movie named trojan wars costed $15,000,000 to make and only made $309. I need to find out what movie that is lol agent_1:Wow what a loss, did you know Steven Spielberg still make millions from star wars because a bet from George Lucas in 1977? agent_2:Yes I read that. I did not know that he Directed The Color Purple. Saving private ryan was one of my favorites though. agent_1:Either me I just recently saw color purple and it still a good movie like  I have seen it for the first time. agent_2:You see how big Oprah is now right? She was wonderful in that movie. agent_1:Yes she was, do you usually purchase your tickets from the box office or purchase online? agent_2:I always buy it online. I try to avoid missing out on big titles like star wars. Pick it up at the theatre. agent_1:Did you know that more than 80 percent of the earth natural forests already been destroyed? agent_2:Yeah I read that. And we continue to use our resources like we dont have a clue whats going on. If global warming hits us, think of the already 71 % water covering earth. It will be catastrophic  agent_1:Yes you are right, we can't see it because most of the water is underneath us. 	agent_2:Oooo imagine the animals in the unexplored water world we have not seen yet. 4.5 million years old and the world has animals in its oceans for quite some time now.

I did not know that about the day being so short agent_1:Yeah when you think about it it makes it ever sadder to what we are doing to this planet agent_2:Well, the UN has appointed an official ambassador to extraterrestrials so hopefully we make some alien friends soon so we can move planets.  agent_1:haha, that would be kind of cool. apparently earth will be helium free by the end of this century agent_2:No more helium balloons? Aww... agent_1:I know, but maybe it is for the better. do you like animals agent_2:I don't really like them as pets but in nature yes. It's sad that the dodo bird is extinct. I hope we stop destroying the earth and habitats for animals. The dodo bird was actually a sub family of pigeon. agent_1:Yeah and I think it was a nice looking bird. I hope so too. their bones are lighter than their feathers agent_2:Yeah, this is due to their bones being hollow. agent_1:yeah, I guess that makes sense for them since they need to fly	agent_2:Right.

One was Tommy Orange's debut novel. agent_2:I heard about that one, its the one with the little native american boy right? agent_1:Yes! It was quite an emotional read. It made me really think about how life is like for them. agent_2:Native Americans suffered for a lot of years, its a story that involves a lot of blood and tears and not an easy story to tell agent_1:Definitely! Orange did a great job w how he shared their history... It was quite diff from the 2nd book I read. A Visit From The Goon Squad, familiar? agent_2:I heard that book was pretty good as well, kind of dark though,  agent_1:For sure, there were some powerful tales. I found the sory about the man born with fetal alcohol syndrome the darkest. You? agent_2:I felt sorry about him as well, his mother is in jail so what kind of life can he even have, did you hear about the overweight joung man,  agent_1:Yeah, that one was crazy, he had a lot against him. Kinda sad. It all stayed w me for awhile. Had to take a break from the book. agent_2:I agree, so do you like fiction?  agent_1:I enjoy both fiction and non, however, I espcially like fiction books that have fact along with some imagination sprinkled in.	agent_2:I see well did you ever play the Super Smash Bros video game? there is actaully a long fiction piece about the game	agent_1 likes video games. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['video games', 'life', 'life'].

I like that they have a lot of vehicles coming out like the model S and model X these days agent_1:Yeah, I heard they were coming out with new cars. Exciting!! What do you think of Elon Musk? I have watched him a few times in interviews. agent_2:Yeah he's very entertaining and interviews I think. It is crazy to me though that the Tesla Model S is so safe that somehow it broke the safety testing equipment, I don't know how that's possible LOL agent_1:Really, I agree, How does that happen? Saw where he took a  $78 million pay cut in 2014. agent_2:Yeah that is impressive. It's also impressive that Tesla releases their patents in order to encourage competition, I definitely would not do that if I owned the company haha agent_1:Most people wouldn't, wonder why? To help the environment? Who knows he probably got something else better lined up! agent_2:Yeah I agree. It's crazy though that they named themselves after Nikola Tesla, but they're not the only company that was named after him! There is another car company called just Nicola apparently agent_1:Interesting, I owned an electric car for 3 years, it was an easy car to drive. My husband named it the phantom! He could never here when I got home. lol agent_2:Haha well that is one benefit of the electric-car then! On a different note though, what do you think about Fox News? Apparently they broadcasting over 86 countries around the world agent_1:About the only one I watch these days! I didn't know Richard Nixon was one of the creators!  agent_2:Yeah I didn't know that either! I also didn't know that they were going to sue The Simpsons because they kept parodying them, I thought that fox owns The Simpsons? agent_1:I did too! Didn't know they were going to create a cable channel  just for The Simpsons! Do you watch that show? agent_2:I liked to watch The Simpsons yes, back to fox news though it's interesting that their median viewer age is 68, that seems old	agent_1:Yes, That's strange, find that hard to believe.

3931	agent_1:Do you know why baseball manager wear the uniforms like the players do?  agent_2:I do!  They wear it because they are technically able to play for their tams if the need arises!  Baseball is a pretty popular sport in Japan.   agent_1:Yeah i hear they think it should be their pastime. I wonder if a manager has ever jumped into a game.  agent_2:They can if need be.  There are some major baseballs fans out there! agent_1:Yeah unfortunately I do not have the patience for it. Kickball is called soccer baseball in Canada.  agent_2:That's a funny term in my opinion!  There was one person who found 3 million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic.  He  hit a gold mine! agent_1:Right, why can't stuff like that happen to me, lol. Up until 2005 a married couple was responsible for scheduling all 2430 major league games.  agent_2:Dang that sounds like a busy life scheduling all that!  One thing I like from baseball is they get to wear hats.  Do you like hats? agent_1:Love hats, all kinds my friend. How about you?  agent_2:Yep I do also!  Fun little fact about in the Old West, the Cowboy hat was not the most popular.  The Bowler hat was, whichever that looks like! agent_1:Yeah police wear distinct hats usually peaked caps or brimmed hats, like the mounties.  agent_2:Yep their hats are noticeable!  Another fun fact I learned is a chefs funny hat they wear are called Toque! agent_1:Yeah that is a fun fact i did not know that. Some hats were worn for ceremonial purposes such as the mortarboard. agent_2:Ahh yes!  All this knowledge of hats!  Lol!  British politicians were mandated to wear a top hat if making a point of order in the house of commons until 1998! agent_1:Wow that good information. Do you know where tipping your hat originated from?   agent_2:Yep it just so happens to come from knights raising their face visors to show friendliness! agent_1:I think that's really cool! In 1908 a law was passed limiting the length of the hatpins out of fear that suffragettes would use them as weapons.  agent_2:Wow sounded dangerous!  Did you know Dunce caps were worn to encourage foolish behavior? agent_1:Well that's must be were the term originated. You know panda researcher wear panda suits to work.  agent_2:I did not know that, but sounds fun!  Any who, was nice chatting with ya!	agent_1:You also have a great day!! In parting I tip my hat to you my friend.	agent_2 likes farewell. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['farewell', 'history', 'wearable'].
11916	agent_1:Hi, how are you? agent_2:I am great! How are you! agent_1:Very well, thanks. Are you ready for the Presidential race in 2020? agent_2:I am! For me personally it can't get here soon enough. But whatever happens we will get by! I was reading about the talks about how George Hathaway, has a book about the Alt-Right, pretty interesting.  agent_1:Yeah. I am fearful of those groups normalizing hate speech, sorry if you're alt-right... agent_2:I am definitely not Alt-Right, these groups are scary to me. All the extremist groups are very scary. A man named Tenold wrote personal accounts on a personal level with these groups. Very interesting. agent_1:If I am alt-right, I do not want my name included with the KKK. However, I am not alt-roght and think they should be lumped in with them. agent_2:Everyone thinks modern day KKK is not a threat even by the Alt Right but I have to say they are in my opinion. They have committed hate crimes just as much as the other groups.  agent_1:I agree. I think their speech is just as dangerous. It tells others that hate speech is allowable and endorsed by people like the president.  agent_2:Exactly, couldn't agree more. Our country is so crazy and the books these men are writing prove to be a bit scary on much hate they have seen and heard. But we hope the upcoming election might change things.	agent_1:I agree. It wouldn't surprise me to see someone so frustrated they run. I am thinking Michelle Obama...	agent_2 dislikes politics. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'greeting', 'news'].
895	agent_1:Hey! I've been reading a lot lately. Do you read any fiction or poetry? agent_2:Hi! Hm. I don't read much fiction or poetry, but I've been exposed to a lot of it in my lifetime. Do you have any favorites? I've tried my hand at creating both, and failed miserably! It's tough! It's an art form, that I just can't do! agent_1:I've been more into poetry lately. It's fascinating that it's been around since prehistorical times, with hunting poetry in Africa.  agent_2:Oh it's fascinating, for sure! Even more so to me since it eludes my abilities. heh. I've read that there is a poem which when read forwards is depressing, and when read backwards is inspiring! I'd really like to read it, but I can't find anything more about it, as of yet. agent_1:That is fascinating. Similarly, Demetri Martin once wrote a 224 word palindrome poem.  agent_2:Oh wow! Now there is a poem, I forgot that I loved! The Raven, by Edgar Allen Poe. It's been so long since I've heard it! I mean like 20+ years! Something about The Raven rap-tap-tapping on his door, or floor? Haha. I heard he only got $9 for the publication of that poem! Go figure. agent_1:Wow! Just $9?! Somebody got a bargain! Did you know Edgar Allen Poe also wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction? Pretty diverse author, isn't he? agent_2:Oh yeah? What an interesting person he must have been, in general! I don't even know what Javanese is , but apparently their alphabet when recited in order, is a poem. The ABC's are pretty poetic to me, now that we recite them so sing-songy.	agent_1:I wonder what kind of poems a computer could come up with? Computers do everything else, they can control microwave ovens, remote controls, robots...why not write poetry, right?

Planning the meal and making everything fit on my oven is like tetris. agent_1:Yes, so do I! and I agree, Thanksgiving and Chsitmas are my favorite Holidays. and you are right especially if you only have one oven to work with like susan westmoreland says ""it's a bit like an acrobatic dance"" lol agent_2:Great way to make a word picture, yes! I would totally agree. Planning backwards are what some experts say to do, like Susan Gage Caterers. agent_1:haha, true! Another of my all time fav things to do would be dance! although my back doesnt like it so much. I love watching dance videos... agent_2:Oh yeah, me too!Dancing while I bake pies for Thanksgiving is an exacta. I have a guilty pleasure of dancing to ballet musicals. I read that those ballerinas go through four pairs of pointe shoes per week.! agent_1:That is a daily, cooking and dancing! and ouch! 4 pairs! Oh my word, that beats my once every year. Another great dance was Michael Jackson, he had a patent on a device, I didnt know you could achieve lean in dance moves agent_2:Really, that is a cool fact. I liked his music even though the person is in question. agent_1:True, its hard to know truth from lies in the media unfortunately, Bruce lee was also a great dancer he even won the hong kong cha-cha championship in 1958! I didnt know there was such a thing. agent_2:The Cha Cha winner! How cool is that, Bruce Lee was an amazing athlete all the way around. I think its so sweet how babies can spontaneously dance when they hear music.lol agent_1:Yes, I have 2 year old twin boys and they Love to ""shake shake shake, shake your booty"" haha they crack up everytime. They love to dance and watch our birds. Do you have birds? agent_2:How precious! lol. Oh yeah, we have many many birds that come fly into our windows, in fact. Hummingbirds steal the spider webs to construct the own nests too, thats a nice bonus for me and less cleaning too. agent_1:Wow, yes birds are amazing creatures and so light! their light bones are so hollow sometimes weighing less than their feathers. Love them. agent_2:Yes, so delightful and treasured. Mine will mimic things that make me run looking for alarms sometimes.lol"	agent_1:haha, I always wondered what such distances they can fly without resting.

7883	agent_1:Hello do you like baseball? agent_2:I do like baseball. I think it's crazy that the baseball managers can actually play the game. That's why they wear the uniforms agent_1:Yeah that is,  considering theres like 20 players on the team,  I think its safe to say the manager can just not suit up lol  agent_2:Haha that's a good point. Do you know what they call kickball in Canada agent_1:I read it but I dont remember lol  agent_2:Haha well they call it soccer-baseball, a very dumb name in my opinion LOL agent_1:maybe they should shorten it to like socball lol  sounds better to me.  agent_2:Lol that does sound a lot better actually. Can you imagine if you found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in your attic. I would probably have a heart attack agent_1:i would go on vacations!  Like a really nice one,  then save or invest the rest.  I wish my family collected something cool like that.   agent_2:Yep I agree. Did you know that baseball is super popular in Japan? agent_1:who wouldve thought!   agent_2:I know right. I guess a lot of Japanese are confused in knowing that it is America's national pastime. but we created the game so that's why it's so weird haha agent_1:Yeah really.  Do you watch game of thrones? agent_2:I do like Game of Thrones. What about you? I can't wait for the new season to start in April agent_1:seriously!!! Im re watching all of the season to prepare for it hahaha  agent_2:Yep I need to do that too! I love that Peter Dinklage has won three Emmy Awards. He does a great job in that show agent_1:he does a great of making us hate him lol I really love Tyrion. 	agent_2:Tyrion is awesome haha.

The movie about Hans Solo just came out on Netflix.  agent_1:Is that the one where its about a young Han Solo? agent_2:Yeah it is the one, so Han Solo is not played by Harrison Ford, does it affect your opinion of the movie ? agent_1:Someone else can fill Harrison Fords shoes? Maybe ill check into how well this Alden guy does in the role agent_2:He did a good job, but Han Solo was already young in the 1977 movie, I think it impacted negatively the movie.  agent_1:Does Chewbacca appear in this movie? agent_2:Yes it does, but it is not the same actor who did the other movies. I don't think that matters too much.  agent_1:I like their relationshop in the movies. Chewy is a very loyal friend agent_2:In the canon Chewy has a family a wife and 2 sons.  agent_1:Thats interesting. I heard George RR Martin had an illustration that Chewie is based off of agent_2:I heard that too, it was on the cover of one of his small stories. It is a peculiar creature when you think about it.  agent_1:I wonder what other crazy creatures we could have had in space with Martins help.

3915	agent_1:Do you know why baseball manager wear the uniforms like the players do?  agent_2:I do!  They wear it because they are technically able to play for their tams if the need arises!  Baseball is a pretty popular sport in Japan.   agent_1:Yeah i hear they think it should be their pastime. I wonder if a manager has ever jumped into a game.  agent_2:They can if need be.

3374	agent_1:Hey, you a fan of any sports involving hitting balls with sticks? agent_2:Many such games fit that description.   Golf is one I enjoy. agent_1:I like golf a lot. It's a real shame how much water is wasted per day on each course, though. It's over 300,000 gallons a day a course! agent_2:True, but consider that golf courses in America combined are larger than the size of two small US states! agent_1:Yeah, golf must be pretty popular in that case. Did you know there exists a golf course in Dubai that uses around 4 million gallons a day? That must cost a lot of money. agent_2:I suppose that comes with games that cannot and do not utilize a standardized playing area agent_1:You know what games do utilize a standardized playing area? Baseball and softball. The fields are pretty similar. agent_2:Interesting.    Babe Ruth was both a famous golfer and baseball player! agent_1:Speaking of famous people who play sports, Samuel L. Jackson actually plays golf twice a week during filming of whatever he's in. agent_2:Cool.    Did you know Jose canseco claims to hold the record for longest softball homerun at 622 feet agent_1:Woah, that's really far! Softball players don't make a lot of money. It's usually between $5,000 and $6,000. agent_2:Well, what do you expect with a game invented at the YMCA?	agent_1:Softball may have been invented at the YMCA, but it's pretty much a lesser baseball, which is America's national pastime. 	agent_2 likes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'travel', 'famous players'].

The universe is certainly fascinating. agent_2:It is indeed, have you ever observed Mars in the sky ? NASA wants to send people there in 20-25 years.  agent_1:I have a few times, but never by telescope or anything like that.  I have heard that a colonization project was planned for 2023 and was going to be funded by making some sort of reality show.  That would be a fun one to watch. agent_2:There is a few contests about the colonization of Mars, NASA has also one, you have to submit a concept for  a house on Mars.  agent_1:the 3.15 million dollar prize would be a nice one to win for that.  I would love to see humans make it to mars in my life time.  I wonder if the first country there would try to claim it as their territory. agent_2:I don't think they will claim to Mars, it will be more like the Moon, even Antarctica does not belong to a country.   agent_1:True.  It is also crazy that a satellite was lost on Mars because Locheed Martin used the imperial system but NASA used metric.  How could they not get that detail in order? agent_2:Locheed is a big company based in the US. The Imperial system is still used there, maybe they had an European subcontractor and units got mixed up.  	agent_1:Very possible.

Elton John chose Lady Gaga as his son's godmother! agent_1:That is pretty cool. Did you know her name came from a predictive text glitch?  agent_2:I didn't know that.  She was on MTV's ""boiling points"" before she was famous. agent_1:Yeah, that I did know. Or I knew she was on TV.  agent_2:The LAPD asked Lady Gaga to tweet her 11.4 million followers information about some upcoming roadwork. lol agent_1:Interesting.

Didier Drogba  is a soccer player that stopped a civil war in his home country.  agent_1:I read the other day that they have used helicopters to dry off the fields for tennis agent_2:Wow. It's really amazing what they will do for professional sports. And yet grunting in tennis can be considered cheating.  agent_1:Really? I think they do that like every hit! agent_2:The best players seem too. LOL! agent_1:Maybe it gives them an advantage! I know a black man won in 1968, and none have won since, that is odd agent_2:Was that Rodney Wallace's father? agent_1:I am not sure to be honest... I have also heard a tennis player invented the polo! agent_2:That makes me curious about who invented table tennis.  Apparently Ping Pong is the name of the company that sells table tennis equipment. It's not the name of the game. I was surprised when I heard that. agent_1:That is like the kleenex issue! Tennis is pretty much large scale ping pong!	agent_2:Totally! Kleenex and Reynolds Wrap are brands that are so well known, their genre of products are known by the company name.

Did you know the us sante used the same gavel for 165 years! agent_2:Yeah until Nixon broke it. I wonder if they were mad at him for that agent_1:haha,  maybe he just had to pay for a new gavel.  agent_2:Maybe.

Did you know video games were initially called cathode ray tube amusement devices and were used by the military? agent_2:Yes, cathode ray tubes have come and gone and the game plays on.  I have a Playstation 3, but no plans to upgrade.   agent_1:I have a ps3 as well. I dont see the point to buying a ps4. This one is all I need as well. agent_2:The game Destiny turned me off gaming.  It was fun to play, but it demands network connectivity.  Sometimes the old games are just fun.  Donkey Kong and Mario are still OK.  I see Fifa 14 works on PS2, PS3 and PS4. agent_1:I was never into soccer games. I liked Madden though. Did you know that ps3s are being used to research black holes. agent_2:Yes, people let them run and they network together.  Sort of like the 1760 PS3's used by the department of defense to make a super computer.  Never tried Madden. agent_1:Never played madden. You will have to try it. How about grand theft auto. Have you played that one? agent_2:I do indeed love GTA.  I want to say that I played early rev levels on a PC.  It was a different game back then. FUDGE RIPPLE!  I will search for a disk and see if it is audio. agent_1:THe original game when played in a cd player would play the soundtrack to the game. agent_2:Interesting.  Have you ever had carpel tunnel syndrome brought on by playing games? agent_1:Actually I have. I dont know if that is why I got it though. I was typing a lot for work when I got it. agent_2:Yes, it can be a big deal.  Imagine a Major League Baseball player missing games because of carpel tunnel.  LOL. agent_1:I can imagine it. It really is painful. Did you know that baseball managers wear a uniform because they are allowed to play if needed? agent_2:Haha.  Imagine if your boss could sit in for you at work.

But it seems like a cool show, what channel is it on?  agent_2:It's on Discovery Channel. It's a yearly event they have with all different sorts of shows that they air. agent_1:I don't think I have that channel. Did you know sharks rescue sailors?  agent_2:I never knew that, I only thought it was dolphins that did that. That is an interesting behavior for a predator. agent_1:It sort of sounds not real to me.  agent_2:Yeah I kind of have a hard time believing it as well. I like watching some of the crazy movies they have made about sharks like The Meg or Sharknado as well. agent_1:Did you know sharks can be trained like dogs to bark?  agent_2:I did not know that. That's another shark fact that I have some skepticism about! agent_1:Yeah, I have a lot of them to be honest. Apparently they also evolved earlier than dinosaurs.  agent_2:That one I can believe, they have been around is some form for a long time. The Megaladon was a huge ancient shark. They think the Great White caused it's extinction because they were smaller and able to get to prey better. agent_1:What about dogs, are you a fan of dogs?  agent_2:I am a big dog person, I have one of my own.

It is not my first choice for a genera but I enjoy all fantasy.  agent_1:yeah , me either but is it in the reading list of three out of five us military branches agent_2:I don't think I would like a military recommended novel which would focus on battle strategies. I prefer Harry Potter. agent_1:nice, that is a good one. did you know the actor who play malfoy was caught trying to steal the wand? agent_2:I would hope they would let him have the wand anyway. I would imagine those actors deserve the memorabilia.  agent_1:i think so too. when daniel won the part of harry potter, do you know what his reward was? agent_2:I think his parents let him watch Faulty Towers. I am only vaguely familiar with the TV show but I would imagine it is still a fun classic show in the UK. agent_1:yeah and he must have been so happy to be able to do that agent_2:Yes, I am sure he is very grateful for being able to be apart of the movies. The Lord of the Rings films came out during that time and I always though he would also make a great Frodo. agent_1:ohh yeah that is true. do you know where hogwarts is located?	agent_2:Yes, Hogwarts is in Scotland.	agent_1 likes hobbies. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobbies', 'job', 'job satisfaction'].

I think the era of mega stars like that is over. Too bad. agent_2:Yeah Mick was awesome, the Stones had so many great hits over the years.  I can't believe they still tour!  That is impressive! agent_1:He is my age and I can't even get out of bed in the morning. He's a marvel. agent_2:Lol, yeah and their shows are like 2 hrs i'm pretty sure, that is so nuts.  Do you attend many concerts these days? agent_1:Not now-too expensive. The first time I saw Led Zeppelin was at a place called The Boston Tea Party. They had just come to America and no one knew who they were. It was a small Club so I got to see them up close. agent_2:That is awesome, they were one of the best ever, very jealous of you.   agent_1:I saw a lot of people there. Andy Warhol was a sponsor. I think I liked BB King the best. But I don't remember Phil Collins. agent_2:Wow, that sounds like an amazing time.  BB King would be awesome to see as well.  I have only been to smaller bands, I did see Radiohead play though, that was pretty cool, but to be honest I mainly went to see the opening band! agent_1:It was easy to see everyone in the Sixties. Tickets were cheap and a lot of people played on the Boston Common. Judy Colling and Joan Baez used to sit on the sidewalk in front of the Harvard Coop and play for free. agent_2:Wow, that is so awesome, most of the music I listen to comes from the 60's, I would have done anything to see Marc Bolan or Syd Barrett perform live.  agent_1:I like Pink Floyd! I don't see that We are the Champions is the catchiest tune ever. That makes no sense. agent_2:Good call! Yeah I don't agree with that at all.  There are plenty more catchy tunes from the 50's and 60's I would say.  agent_1:I would have liked to see Pink Floyd in a Roman Amphitheater. I bet the sound was really good. agent_2:Yeah that would have been cool, so many concerts over the years that would have been amazing to attend.  agent_1:I used to like the music really loud but I saw Led Zeppelin (after they got to be famous) at the Boston Garden and it was too loud. Ever one lit little candles-you couldn't do that now. The Fire Marshall would have a heart attack. lol agent_2:Yeah imagine them trying to do things like that now, no way!  So, be glad you got to experience it like that I would say.  agent_1:Everyone was friendly and there was no trouble.

9710	agent_1:Hi. I think it's so fascinating to learn facts about the earth. Earth will be virtually helium free by the end of the 21st-century. I wonder what is causing that? agent_2:Good question! Humans only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds if the entire earths history was viewed as 1 day! agent_1:Wow that is hard to believe. And back when the earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long. agent_2:That is wild! Over 80% of Earths natural forests have been destroyed! agent_1:That is quite sad. Only 20% remaining, well I hope we can conserve that at least. agent_2:Hopefully! Do you think extraterrestrials will ever make contact with us? agent_1:I don't know that is a good question I think at some point but I don't know if it will be in my lifetime. There is definitely a lot of sightings in the literature but no specific evidence. The FDA once burned 6 tons of literature in an active US censorship. agent_2:That is absurd! I love how there is a literature contest that challenges people to come up with the worst opening sentence to a novel. agent_1:That is very funny I would love to read some of those sentences. One surprising thing is that romantic kissing is a fairly recent development and is rarely mentioned even an ancient Greek literature. agent_2:Very interesting. Love how Churchill won a nobel peace prize in literature and not peace. agent_1:Yeah that is very interesting and something I did not know. He was a very smart man. Pretty cool he was  able to accomplish that back in 1953. agent_2:Have you seen the Wonder Woman movie? agent_1:Yes I have it I thought it was really cool. Gal Gadot did a great job. DC comics must've been very impressed. agent_2:Definitely! She actually served in the Israeli Defense Forces for 2 years. agent_1:Wow she is really an amazing woman. Explains why the fight scenes were so realistic. When wonder woman first appeared as a member of the Justice society in 1941 the group made her their secretary. Oh how times have changed. agent_2:I did not know it was the highest grossing superhero origin movie! agent_1:Yeah that is a huge accomplishment wow. It is also the highest grossing world war one movie. agent_2:Very impressive. I really did like that movie. agent_1:Yes it was a great one. 2017 was also a great year for movies and it was the first year since 1958 that the top three highest grossing domestic films were female lead. agent_2:Makes sense! Gal did not even know she was auditioning for wonder woman. She thought it was Catwoman!	agent_1:Ha ha that is hilarious.Patty Jenkins was a great director of that movie.

Have you seen it? agent_1:I heard about it. Christopher Robin is the adult version of winnie the pooh right? agent_2:Yeah, that's the one.  Ewan McGregor is Christopher Robin as an adult.  But he ends up going back to the land that Winnie the Pooh and Tiger and all of them live in. agent_1:I think it's plot sounds wonderful for not only children, but also adults to reconnect with their childhoods in a similar manner agent_2:Yeah.  It was pretty nostalgic for me since I used to love Winnie the Pooh as a kid.  It was fun.  I recommend it, if you're interested. agent_1:Sweet.

I think hummingbirds are amazing.  They steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nest agent_1:haha that is funny, I do like birds, I think it would be scary to be in Austrailia and birds there can mimic different sounds, like you're walking along and think someone is chasing you with a chainsaw, but it's just a bird making that sound haha agent_2:wow that would be scary!  I saw that the famously discint do do bird is actually a sub-family of pigeon  agent_1:that is wild, I know people hunted the dodo because they were eating them, so I guess if we want to know what they tasted like we could try pigeon haha	agent_2:this is interesting.

Maryland's governor, Larry Hogan, is a republican who was under some hot water for policies on climate change. agent_2:Thats interesting.  the beatles song""come together"" was written for 1969 governor campaign. agent_1:Larry Hogan could probably have used the support of a group like the Beatles, but I'm sure he will be ok.  At least he isn't as bad as North Dakota's in 1934 who actually seceded from the US for a short time! agent_2:when schwarzenegger became governor of ca he commuted 3 hours everyday lol  agent_1:Maybe so he could leave the office every day and say ""I'll be back!""   agent_2:haha good one!    agent_1:Did you hear that Texas had a female governor before other states even allowed women to vote? agent_2:Yeah thats really interesting. did you know there hasnt been a us president who wasnt a rep or dem since 1853? agent_1:Wow!  We truly are a two party system, but don't try getting elected as president as a democrat with a beard.  So far all bearded presidents have been republican. agent_2:Im not excited about that,  I will never be president lol  agent_1:It's crazy to think that red/blue connotations for the parties isn't even 20 years old.   agent_2:Yeah it seems like that was always the case,  but I guess not.   agent_1:The Bush's had a heck of a run with three terms.  In fact, before Trump, you'd have to go back to 1928 to find an elected republican that didn't have nixon or a bush. agent_2:Thats interesting,  do you know much about our planets?

I have heard of Tommy Orange's fiction novel about Native Americans. agent_1:That's interesting!  He is a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes.  I don't know much about those two tribes.  His book is about a boy? agent_2:Yes.  It is fiction however.  It provides insight into the challenges that the boy has in grappling with his identity.  We have a national history where many atrocities and slurs dot the history. agent_1:True!  I went to an indian reservation this past summer in New York.  It was the Seneca nation and I went through one of their museums.  They pretty much got kicked out of their land just like all the other tribes in the nation. agent_2:A people divided into tribes cannot stand against a unified enemy.  But, my wife's best friend has a Ph.D. and the government paid for all of her education because she is Cherokee.

I guess its pretty popular around the world. agent_1:I guess so. Netflix and YouTube make up half the peak internet traffic in North America. agent_2:I watch more youtube than I do Netflix. Which do you prefer? agent_1:I prefer YouTube as well. Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth agent_2:I think Neflix is over rated these days. It use to be pretty neat being able to stream movies. But then the cost went up and its not as awesome. Youtube is free and I can find lots more videos on random stuff.	agent_1:I agree.

From what i hear Anki wants his robots to be able to hold their own with people. agent_1:I think it would be a great service for people, I heard they  are the best selling toy company on Amazon agent_2:They've got a new product called Vector.  It is like Alexa and their goal is to have one in every home. agent_1:Oh so they are working with Amazon now? Jeff Bezos is a great CEO, he would be of great contribution to the project agent_2:I'm not sure if they are working together or  competing.  They are using alexa as an example for what they want their vector to be.  They say there is one big difference between the two though. Their Vector has a personality. agent_1:Oh I see, I heard there is also a female vector voice in their plans, agent_2:Did you know that Pixar is the inspiration behind the personality they are trying to create with Vector? agent_1:I didnt know that, I hope Vector can be successful, theyve had inspiration from several compnies including Apple, Google and Microsoft  agent_2:Taking from the best!  I think the only problem, or at least a major problem, that they have is price.  They are pricing it at $1000.  Seems too high considering alexa's price. agent_1:I think their goal is for Vector to cost $250 at a retail price, still seems really expensive,  agent_2:Yep, your're right!

Something about that game gets him all jacked up and he acts like a different kid. agent_2:There have been a lot of studies on video games and it's effect on children. The consensus always seems to be that they use it as an outlet. 	agent_1:I think listening to the way the other people talk and act affects him.

I heard that it's opening was a career low opening day total for Spacey, though. It's because of all the bad accusations against him, I think. agent_2:I saw him in the movie Baby Driver, but the accusations are definitely a deterrent for some people with how widespread #MeToo has become agent_1:Yes, I actually haven't seen him in a movie since American Beauty. I watch movies on Netflix sometimes. Do you? agent_2:I have to be in the mood since I like to read and listen to a lot of books. I tend to create a watchlist on Netflix faster than I can watch things, but I like how convenient it is. I can't imagine having to rent movies from Blockbuster agent_1:Netflix is really popular now. I hear it accounts for a third of all the bandwidth in North America during late night. agent_2:I think the shows and movies help people unwind now, and there's no commercial breaks. Combined with YouTube, the two account for half the bandwidth in North America agent_1:I hear Netflix actually spends more on postage than on bandwidth. The owner started the company after being annoyed by a late fee of his VHS movie rental. agent_2:I would be annoyed about a rental fee that's higher than it costs for the VHS. It's still strange to think that people still use the rental service, but I guess internet connection isn't always the best in some places agent_1:Yes I think maybe it's from parents getting stuff for their kids to watch while they can watch streaming Netflix at the same time. agent_2:Netflix is capable of streaming on more than one device at the same time depending on the subscription. Either way, it's still better than if Blockbuster had bought Netflix agent_1:Of course. I think some wifi can't handle that, though. Yes, I heard they actually turned down buying Netflix. It was for much lower of a price than it's worth now, too! agent_2:I think their value went up once they started creating their own content. It's part of the appeal now to keep users loyal agent_1:Yes, Netflix creating their own content seems like it's part of a cinematography revolution or something! agent_2:Maybe if they team up with cinematographer Roger Deakins, his 14th nomination for the Oscars will be the one that finally wins. Losing 13 times would be hard agent_1:Yes, that would be hard. On the bright side, I bet not many cinematographers have been putting out such mention worthy work for so many years! agent_2:Not since James Wong Howe back in the 1940s. He was Chinese before finally becoming a citizen, but he used techniques such as low lighting and wide-angle lenses before it was popular agent_1:Sounds like a very talented and revolutionary cinematographer.

Did you know Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory is the best-selling album of the 21st century? agent_2:That's actually pretty surprising! Two twins in Japan released a rap album when they turned 100. It's never too late I guess. agent_1:Well said! I would love to hear it sometime haha. The Dark Side of the Moon was still one of the top albums in 2014, 40 years after release! agent_2:That's pretty awesome! Reel big fish had to rerecord all their hits for a best of album after losing the rights to their old record label. Ouch. agent_1:Well at least they could remember how the songs went haha. That is crazy how that could happen! agent_2:Yeah, that really sucks.When eddie van halen recorded the solo for beat it he set the speakers on fire! agent_1:That would have been a sight to see lol.

12368	agent_1:Hi, do you like animals? agent_2:I do like them cant believe there are 20 quintillion animals out there agent_1:I was surprised that a white patch develops when animals are domesticated. Maybe that's why married men go grey... agent_2:Thats funny, that would make sense, animals have constitutional rights in Germany agent_1:Did you know that hiccups are an early evolution from land animals. agent_2:I guess we are all animals and another fact that supports evolution,  agent_1:Did you hit enter prematurely?!?!? I do that more than I would like to admit. I wonder what the loch ness monster evolved from. agent_2:I did, I hate it when that happens, and I have no idea, good thing Nessie is a protected species. Since 1912 at least. agent_1:How long do loch ness monsters live for? How many are there? I have questions! I do not need answers though. I would like to know more about a sound frequency that causes fear in humans. I have enemies I need to vanquish! agent_2:Well Nessie is a myth, hopefully one day we can find out if the myth is true or not, and thats sounds interesting didnt know there was a fear frequency for humans. agent_1:Me either. Did you know we may have lost all of our body hair as recently as 240000 years ago? As a swimmer, I still see a lot of hairy humans! agent_2:I guess many of them didnt lose it lol, there are some hairy humans out there I agree with you	agent_1:Did you know ribs grew back?

But I find it really interesting, full of small details, like managers wear a uniform so they could replace a player if they need to.  agent_2:That is probably a holdover from the old days when a player was chosen to be manager. Nowadays, it wouldn't work. agent_1:Yes, I wonder if it could be even dangerous for some of them, like some could have an heart attack.   agent_2:Yeah, no insurance company would touch the managers on the field, that's for sure. agent_1:I think they would be better at softball, did you ever watch a softball game ?  agent_2:I have never watched a softball game, though I understand many women play it.  agent_1:I think it is more a hobby than a professional sport, the average salary is around 5500 $ per year, some hobos make more.  agent_2:Hobos? I never thought of income in terms of hobos, though I guess they do make money through their illicit means.  agent_1:Panhandling can be quite profitable, for someone with no income. Like in a busy place as Manhattan. But even if I don't consider softball as a legitimate pro sport, if was the first event televised on ESPN.    agent_2:Can you win money through betting though? That always legitimizes a sport. agent_1:Yes, if it is your criteria, then video game is a legitimate sport. They have leagues and a lot of betting is done on matches.  agent_2:Their is a physicality to what they do, but it's just in the hands. agent_1:As shooting, and it is even an Olympic sport, but it is strange to see a smoking fat man winning a medal.

If you went on Mount Everest would you take a selfie at the top? Apparently they have 3-g service there agent_2:That would be great, taking a selfie in the top of the tallest mountain, I didnt know you could get addicted to the internet agent_1:I did know that, I'm probably addicted right now haha. And yes if you use the internet too much you can get addicted to clicking links agent_2:That is just crazy, its a good thing there a copy stored in the library of Alexandria, I cant imagine my life without the internet now agent_1:No I agree with you. I wonder how often they back it up at the Alexandria library though? Do you believe that there is extraterrestrial life in the galaxy? agent_2:I do, we are not alone in the world, the universe is so big that there must be alien life in other planets, galaxies agent_1:Yes I think you're right. Have you heard of the Drake equation? It's an equation that calculates the probability that life exists outside of hours in the universe and I think that it has determined that there should be life there somewhere agent_2:No havent heard of it, and then I agree with that equation, there are firefighters that are trained on how to treat aliens in case of a crash or an invasion agent_1:Well that's pretty cool. Did you ever hear of the show X-Files? Apparently in that show aliens began to colonize Earth back in 2012, so maybe they already are here haha	agent_2:I used to love that show, and who knows maybe they are I try to keep an open mind about that	agent_1 likes TV shows. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV shows', 'X-Files', 'addiction'].

Have you ever seen 3rd rock from the sun? agent_1:I have watched a few episodes but I didn't follow it closely? How about you? agent_2:I've seen a few. I heard it beat out Seinfeld, Friends, and even Frasier for the best comedy award in 1997. agent_1:That was a lot of great shows nominated at once. I watch a lot of Brooklyn Nine Nine now, I think that's one of the best shows on TV. agent_2:I've never seen it but I have seen the commercials and it looks funny.  You are right about all those great shows.  Sounds like there was a lot of good comedy back in 1997. agent_1:It's definitely not the same these days as it was back then. I think the rise of cable prices has hurt how many people are watching TV. agent_2:Speaking of cable tv. What do you think of comedy central? agent_1:I like Comedy Central, I haven't watched it as much lately because I have been watching Netflix and Amazon Prime more.	agent_2:Comedy Central may be very particular on how they do comedy.

There's different styles of jazz...Gypsy jazz and Kansas City jazz. agent_2:I didn't know they had those two different styles. That's really cool. agent_1:Yes.  Clint Eastwood is a lifelong jazz fan! agent_2:That's cool. A Harlem woman has held free jazz concerts in her apartment for 20 years now. agent_1:Neat!

And then they run around the bases, if they are lucky enough to hit said ball. agent_1:Yeah that is true. It's crazy that baseball managers can actually join in the game, that's why they wear uniforms agent_2:Yes, if they need to play for their teams, I dont know why that would happen, but it might be fun to watch! agent_1:Yeah that could be cool. It's also cool that a man found millions of dollars worth of old baseball cards in his attic haha his grandfather and put them there and I guess forgotten about them? agent_2:Maybe, I should start checking my attic and see what treasures are stored up there.  I might have an early retirement.   agent_1:Haha yes I hope so! You know what is weird though? Have you ever played the game kickball, apparently it's called soccer-baseball in Canada for some reason agent_2:I guess it is a pretty accurate name too, however I much prefer kickball. agent_1:Uranium kickball sounds a lot better haha. What do you think about the Japanese? Apparently they are shocked to learn that baseball is actually America's pastime and was not invented in Japan agent_2:It is surprising, I bet they wonder why they are not invited to the world series either. agent_1:Haha yes I bet! I think it's interesting that the Women's World Cup higher television ratings than the World Series. I don't like soccer myself. agent_2:I would actually say I am a bigger soccer fan than Baseball.  Especially when it comes to world cups. agent_1:Yeah I don't really like either game haha. It is crazy though that the World Series actually started back in 1903, so I do respect its long history.	agent_2:The cubs won the first back to back series and then didnt win again until 2016.

Those who are elected call the people who are represented ""constituents"" agent_2:Yes, and the Senate is considered more prestigious  and more deliberative. They're both important in for presidential votes, I think."	agent_1:Yes.   The senate has certain rules where 60 votes are required for many bills.  I think that forces more deliberatioin.

5171	agent_1:Do you follow baseball? agent_2:Yes. I am a dodger fan agent_1:Awesome!  I like Walker Buehler.  What do you think of the Dodgers/Reds trade?  Think it was a good one?   agent_2:No. They gave up too much. Puig was a pain in the neck, but one of the best defensive left fielders in baseball. The pitcher wood was a young guy who was an all star 2 years ago agent_1:I was kind of surprised when they did that trade.  Did you know baseball managers wear uniforms because they can technically play if needed? agent_2:Yes. I remember Pete Rose and Frank Robinson doing that agent_1:Yes.  How about the guy who found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards that were hidden in his grandfathers attic since the 1940s.  I'm not ashamed to admit that I still a few packs of baseball cards every year.  It gives me the thrill I had when I was kid opening them. agent_2:Yes my base baseball cards were thrown out many many years ago. I wish I had those back agent_1:They were super huge there in the late 80s and early 90s but have died down in popularity since then.  Did you know kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada? agent_2:Yes. I had heard that before. agent_1:I don't know if I would like to schedule the games.  For 24 years a married couple scheduled all MLB games played each year. agent_2:That sounds like a heck of a big job. agent_1:I would want no part of it.  Babe Ruth was thrown out stealing to end game 7 and lose the 1926 world series.  First time I've ever seen that fact. agent_2:I have never heard that before.  agent_1:First time for me as well.  Did you know that baseball is really popular in Japan and many fans there are surprised to find out it's known as America's national pastime? agent_2:Yes. Baseball has been big in Japan for a long time agent_1:I find it interesting how they name the teams.  Surprised we don't see that here.  We could see the Walmart Cashiers playing the Target Bullseyes. lol agent_2:The  Dodgers are called the Dodgers because their fans in Brooklyn Had to Dodge trollys to get to the Stadium. They were called trolly Dodgers, Then shortened to Brooklyn Dodgers agent_1:That is interesting!  I honestly never knew that!    The womens cup had higher tv ratings than the world series in the US.  That kind of shows the sport is on a downtrend like the cards. agent_2:I never Knew that. But baseball is a slow paced game. I guess the kids like faster paced sports	agent_1:Yes.  They are into video games now (too much if you ask me).  It's been fun talking ball with you!  I enjoyed it.

Have you seen it? agent_1:I have not seen that one. I haven't seen Justin Beiber's Baby either but that is probably good since it is the most disliked video on the platform. agent_2:lol Poor Beib's.  Psy's video got so many views on youtube that they had to upgrade the view count integer to 64 bits. agent_1:You tube is the 2nd largest search engine behind google. Make sense since google owns them. agent_2:I believe that.  Google bought youtube for $1.65 billion dollars!  That's a lot of cash. agent_1:That is! Between youtube and netflix, they make up half of peak internet usage. agent_2:I believe it!  People love videos!  Do you have a playstation? agent_1:I kind of do... My son has one that I bought him. Do you have one? agent_2:My kids do.  I have no idea how to play it. lolol  Playstation 3's are being used to research black holes somehow. agent_1:Wow. The DoD used 1760 of them to build a supercomputer...	agent_2:Wow.

Did you know that even though Clint Eastwood was featured on horses for many of his movies he actually had a mid-life allergy to them? agent_1:Interesting, I wonder if he takes medicines during the scenes.  agent_2:I would think so! It is crazy how human's work, isn't it?  agent_1:Yeah, it is. Apparently they lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago.  agent_2:And yet we still have some. Humans' adaptation for persistence hunting makes them among the best distance runners among all running animals. agent_1:It is pretty weird. Did you know that we will grow a rib in only 2-3 months?  agent_2:No kidding! I had no idea humans could regenerate ribs. agent_1:Interesting isn't it. Did you know there is a frequency that causes fear?  agent_2:No, I did not. Did you know that almost all h=animals and plants can synthesize their own vitamin c but humans can't because their gene for this enzyme is defective. agent_1:Did you know that there are 20 quintillion animals on the earth?  agent_2:Holy cow! That's a lot. I have heard that animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated. agent_1:Interesting, is this all animals?  agent_2:I believe so. Hard to believe but the Loch Ness Monster is a protected species under provisions of a 1912 Scottish protection of animals. agent_1:I can believe it.

I wonder if one has actually ever played? agent_1:The only one I can think if is Pete Rose who regularly played as manager. Do you have a favorite team? agent_2:My favorite team is the Atlanta Braves, from the days of Chipper Jones.  What's your favorite team? agent_1:Mine is the Dodgers. I have to admire that team that Atlanta had, their pitching staff was something else. agent_2:I hear in Japan, baseball is so popular that some Japanese people are shocked to find out that its America's national pastime. agent_1:So I've heard. Do you think that Japan should ever be allowed to compete for the world championship? agent_2:Sure, why not?  They have some pretty good players, actually.  agent_1:They do. I have always been a little upset because the US always considers their sports teams as world champs but yet don't have to prove it. agent_2:That's so true! Hey, did you hear about the man that found all those old baseball cards in his grandfather's attic? agent_1:Yeah that was quite a find. I had no idea that baseball cards were so valuable. agent_2:Me either.  Did you watch the World Series? agent_1:I did watch the world series, and as you can imagine I was once again disappointed in the Dodgers. Did you know that in 1992 the US marines carried the canadian flag upside down? agent_2:I can believe it.  lol Which way does that leaf go anyway? agent_1:To tell you the truth I would have to look it up.

I can't believe they thought it would be a flop. agent_2:$500k cost them billions and made George a billionaire himself agent_1:I'm happy for him.  What I find interesting is that James Earl Jones only took 2.5 hours to record all of his Darth Vader lines and only got paid $7500.00. agent_2:That is crazy to think about! And the movie wouldn't be the same without his voice. agent_1:You're so right.  Nobody else could have said,""  Luke, I am your father"", quite like him.  lol agent_2:Speaking of Luke, did you know he was originally written as a girl? agent_1:Yeah, I had heard that about Luke.

"	agent_1:No, times have changed and integrity and honesty went out the window a long time ago.

I wonder how many people there have never left their towns? agent_1:I'm sure many are content where they are. I would hate to live in Japan though, it costs 300 dollars in tolls to drive across country. agent_2:That would be an expensive road trip. I wonder how the first king to travel around the world got around? agent_1:I think it was King Kalakaua of Hawaii to do that and that was long before airplanes! agent_2:I wonder if he went to Mackinac Island? They've banned motorized vehicles there for over a hundred years. I bet it's peaceful there! agent_1:I bet it is, instead of hearing the snow plows like I am right now!

For them, it's about human safety agent_1:I understand, but the guy that was killed was in a protected croc sanctuary. It was kind of his fault. agent_2:And I guess the species is endangered, which is part of why it's a big deal agent_1:Yes.  40 cops tried to stop the crowd, but it turned into a mob of 600 villagers. agent_2:Most of the time they try to remove the animals humanely, but those cases are also in the United States. Those villagers likely acted out of fear agent_1:Yes, in some instances animals that attack are required to be put down and tested for disease like rabies agent_2:On the other end of the spectrum, animals have guaranteed legal rights in Germany agent_1:That is good.  There is a line between public safety and animal cruelty agent_2:As long as the public is safe. In Scotland, the Loch Ness monster is a protected species agent_1:That is funny.  Next it will be bigfoot	agent_2:If Bigfoot is in the US, that one may not happen.

Do you ever listen to things on LP?   agent_1:Yes...... when i was in clg agent_2:I still have one at home and some of my grandfathers old records, but for most of my music I ve moved in to the 20th Centruy and gone with CDs and mostly MP3. agent_1:thats amazing...... 	agent_2:Do you have a favorite album?	agent_1 likes music. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'music format', 'clg'].

12472	agent_1:Did You know that humans may have lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago ? agent_2:I think that fact is misleading. After all, we still have plenty of body hair today. I think it would be more accurate to say humans lost their fur (a consistent/extensive hair covering) within the last 240,000 years ago. agent_1:wow ;) we had fur ? ;) agent_2:What do you think animal hair is? That's why I find wearing actual animal fur so disgusting. I wouldn't wear the skin and hair of another human. Why would I want to wear the skin of an animal? agent_1:no, what I meant was - did WE - humans had fur in the past ? agent_2:Well, yes. Technically we still have fur today (although it is spotty). Fur is the covering of hair used to protect an animal and help it control its temperature and reactions to the climate. agent_1:ok... I've never thought about it this way... agent_2:I think once you adjust your mindset and realize how close we are to modern-day animals, you begin to change how you think of the animals themselves. agent_1:We are modern days animals ? how so... we just sit all day and look at the monitor :) agent_2:We're not just modern-day animals. We ARE animals. Homo sapiens are part of Hominina, which is a subtribe of Animalia (how we classify animals). agent_1:Well at least from a name , ok, but we are logical, spiritual and very intelligent... I don't know if one can call us animals :) agent_2:I disagree. I think animals are also very logical and intelligent. If you think about it, they are smarter than us. Humans are responsible for destroying the planet - and not only are we aware of that, we are consciously choosing to continue! agent_1:...but the fact that we are self-aware should make us something more than animals...	agent_2:Animals are very much self-aware. They can plan for the future and cater their reactions to their environments. That is why you see so much of the animal kingdom continuing to thrive in the face of human interference.	agent_1 dislikes environment. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['environment', 'animals', 'fur'].
7777	agent_1:Hello, do you watch baseball> agent_2:I am a fan of baseball - I used to know the married couple who scheduled all 2430 baseball games every year agent_1:Wow, I guess those are the people that you can call mega fans. I am not the biggest baseball fan although I do go to a few games each year agent_2:Yes baseball is so popular in Japan many people are surprised to find that it is our national game agent_1:I would be surprised too. Kickball is known as soccer-baseball in Canada. That is odd. agent_2:Yes.  I have had a few baseball cards in my day, but one lucky man found his grandfather had saved 3 million dollars worth of cards! agent_1:3 million is probably more money that I will ever have. The only things that my grandparents collect are rocks from their childhood. I do no think that those rocks will ever be worth 3 million! agent_2:laugh for sure!  Maybe you should try to be a team manager - they wear uniforms because theoretically they could put themselves in the game and play! agent_1:Really ? Although I do not think any of them have ever stepped in. I think that the actual players are much better than the coaches.  agent_2:No doubt but it would be fun to see one to step in for an inning - perhaps in the world series championship game agent_1:Speaking of the world series, the Ottoman Empire still existed since the last time that the Chicago cubs won the world series! agent_2:That was until a few years ago!  That was a great year.  The curse of the goat! agent_1:What is the curse of the goat? Is it some kind of superstition? agent_2:The Cubs did not let a man bring his goat into a baseball game around 1918 and he put a curse on them.  It lasted almost a hundred years! agent_1:Ah, thank you. Speaking of the cubs, they were the very first team to win the world series back to back and they have not won since! agent_2:Yes - even famous players can blow it sometimes too - Babe Ruth was caught stealing in game 7 and it caused his team to lose the 1926 world series agent_1:Really? I though Babe Ruth was a renowned baseball player. I wonder why he would steal.	agent_2:Yes he was a big hitter but sometimes you need to steal a base!  He was a big guy though so probably not that fast	agent_1 likes sports. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'sports', 'no'].
3438	agent_1:hi how are you? do you like sports? agent_2:I'm doing very well, thanks. I love sports agent_1:do you like golf? i have never played golf. agent_2:I love golf. Its a great sport where individual players hit balls with clubs into a series of holes on a golf course in as few strokes as possible. agent_1:I never played because it looked expensive. How long have you played? agent_2:I have been playing for about 10 years now and another thing I wanted to mention that the golf course consists of 18 holes but if you play the game for fun its usually 9 holes. agent_1:Ok, but doesnt it cost a lot for the equipment and the greens fees and stuff? agent_2:Well that depends on the equipment you buy and also where you play. agent_1:I guess i would want the cheapest stuff. i played sports with minimal equipment growing up. agent_2:The gold course requires a lot of water to maintain about 312,000 gallons in fact per day. agent_1:That sounds like quite a bit. it is ok in some places, but maybe where water is scarce, it is not ideal. agent_2:This is just the average for American golf courses. I read somewhere that a golf course in Dubai requires 4,000,000 gallons of water per day to maintain. agent_1:That is insane. in a desert country? it seems excessive, but i guess that the rich have the money for that kind of hobby. agent_2:I agree. Do you know any famous baseball player that is also a very famous golfer? agent_1:Is this a recent player? i know that a lot of them play gofl.	agent_2:No this baseball player was back in the 1920s.	agent_1 likes sports. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'travel', 'sports'].

The movie about Hans Solo just came out on Netflix.  agent_1:Is that the one where its about a young Han Solo? agent_2:Yeah it is the one, so Han Solo is not played by Harrison Ford, does it affect your opinion of the movie ? agent_1:Someone else can fill Harrison Fords shoes? Maybe ill check into how well this Alden guy does in the role agent_2:He did a good job, but Han Solo was already young in the 1977 movie, I think it impacted negatively the movie.  agent_1:Does Chewbacca appear in this movie? agent_2:Yes it does, but it is not the same actor who did the other movies. I don't think that matters too much.  agent_1:I like their relationshop in the movies. Chewy is a very loyal friend agent_2:In the canon Chewy has a family a wife and 2 sons.  agent_1:Thats interesting. I heard George RR Martin had an illustration that Chewie is based off of	agent_2:I heard that too, it was on the cover of one of his small stories.

6155	"agent_1:Hi! I recently learned that baseball managers are required to wear uniforms as well because they have to technically play should there be a need. So that must mean, they must stay in shape too right? agent_2:that is interesting, do you think they ever played in a game ? agent_1:I don't think so, I don't watch too much baseball and I don't collect cards either, but I might reconsider seeing how valuable they are when a man found three million dollars worth of cards in his grandfather's attic! agent_2:I had heard about that, imagine being set for life overnight like that! agent_1:How would you sell it? I imagine the buyers would be a small population. agent_2:I suppose so, do you think he took a loss in value trying to sell them for what he could get? agent_1:I think I would and I wonder if he knew the value when he sold them. If he didn't that would be very painful. agent_2:That really would be sad if someone exploited him agent_1:Do you have a favorite baseball team? Mine is the Yankees. agent_2:I am not too into baseball, but who is the ""lost"" yankees player? agent_1:Yeah that's a little frightening and do they mean ""lost"" as in lost his way because of the fame or ""lost"" as in missing?"	agent_2:I am not sure, I just know there is a lost one.

Do you know how many? agent_2:I don't, but I use it to watch a few shows. What kind of stuff do you watch on it? agent_1:I love the movie Apollo 13 on netflix.    Can you believe that film inspired the whole service! agent_2:No kidding? I had no idea! It's amazing what good cinematography can inspire in others. agent_1:Nothing to do with the film, but founder Reed Hastings forgot to return a VHS tape and got $40 in late fees and wanted to do something about it! agent_2:Hah, I guess cinematography isn't everything. I think we all know how he must have felt getting a late fee. If only everyone were as determined to do something about frustrations! agent_1:True.    I do like cinematography though.     It is amazing what can come from a lens and light. agent_2:Cinematography is so fascinating. It's like an intersection of physics and visual art, because of all the dependence on understanding how light and lenses work.	agent_1:True, but it is also about technology - how the sensor produces an electrical charge for each pixel.	agent_2 likes technology. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['technology', 'TV show', 'Netflix'].

What does RBMG mean? agent_1:Taj Mahal is bigger than the white house. agent_2:Wow, I didn't know that, did you know the president's guest house is larger that the white house? What do you think about Robots? agent_1:i think president's guest house is small agent_2:I have lived in Washington DC and have never seen the guest house, but I was shock when I read upon it.

I can't believe that someone had a seizure at Ken Jeong's comedy show! agent_2:I have never had one but i have seen people have them and yeah he thought it was a heckler thats pretty insane agent_1:I know! Crazy! I would have probably though the same. They said he ran right over to the person!  agent_2:Yeah he was an internal medicine practitioner before he turned to comedy so he attended to the woman until medics arrived agent_1:That is great. I heard that the audience members didn't even record this. Amazing! agent_2:That is suprising considering how glued people are to their phones agent_1:I agree. I just hope most people are happy with how he reacted. That can be crazy! agent_2:I agree the audience met him with a round of applause when he returned to the stage. agent_1:So, Did you even realize that Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 shows since 1989?? agent_2:no I did not realize that why are they cancelling so many shows?  agent_1:Personally it feels like it because so many people are so sensitive now.  agent_2:I agree with that I think people are way too sensitive now.. I liked all the shows that used to be on like 3rd Rock form the Sun it won the golden globe for best comedy series in 1997 agent_1:I loved 3rd rock!  Are you into comics at all?

I think the era of mega stars like that is over. Too bad. agent_2:Yeah Mick was awesome, the Stones had so many great hits over the years.  I can't believe they still tour!  That is impressive! agent_1:He is my age and I can't even get out of bed in the morning. He's a marvel. agent_2:Lol, yeah and their shows are like 2 hrs i'm pretty sure, that is so nuts.  Do you attend many concerts these days? agent_1:Not now-too expensive. The first time I saw Led Zeppelin was at a place called The Boston Tea Party. They had just come to America and no one knew who they were. It was a small Club so I got to see them up close. agent_2:That is awesome, they were one of the best ever, very jealous of you.   agent_1:I saw a lot of people there. Andy Warhol was a sponsor. I think I liked BB King the best. But I don't remember Phil Collins. agent_2:Wow, that sounds like an amazing time.  BB King would be awesome to see as well.  I have only been to smaller bands, I did see Radiohead play though, that was pretty cool, but to be honest I mainly went to see the opening band! agent_1:It was easy to see everyone in the Sixties. Tickets were cheap and a lot of people played on the Boston Common. Judy Colling and Joan Baez used to sit on the sidewalk in front of the Harvard Coop and play for free.	agent_2:Wow, that is so awesome, most of the music I listen to comes from the 60's, I would have done anything to see Marc Bolan or Syd Barrett perform live. 	agent_1 likes music. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'music artist', 'music'].
3885	agent_1:Hello, did you know the dodo bird is actual a sub-family of the pigeon. agent_2:I didn't know that- of course I believe the bird is extinct, isn't it?  This year we recently had a bunch of hummingbirds..that was a first for me and so exciting. SO TINY.. agent_1:I also find it interesting that some birds can fly from alaska to north america without sleeping when they migrate. agent_2:Birds are very interesting because of a lot of facts.  I think it helps with their flight that their bones are hollow so not weighed down.  agent_1:Yes, they are interesting. I did not know that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. I find that very interersting. agent_2:I have watched them pull some to make them nearby.  The way they flit about is so beautiful to watch.  It is almost elegant like a dance. ..performing art! agent_1:Yes, did you know that Jackie Chan manages a k-pop band. I did not know that but i think it's cool. agent_2:It seems that so many you wouldn't think to have other interests do.  Jackie in music, Bruce Lee in dancing.  A championship even! agent_1:It seems to be in a kpop band you have to be tough because they go through bootcamps before being signed. agent_2:Boot camps for bands.. Guess it takes a lot of stamina for the dancing and singing.  Kind of the same I would assume for figure skating.  Can you imagine the work to land a triple axel? agent_1:That is true. It looks hard. Did you know babies spontaneously dance when they hear music. They are cute. agent_2:Music is a wonderful thing, so much to come out of it.  Symbiotic relationship with dance and music. Tupac was able to do both- never would have thought ballet for him though. agent_1:Yes, that definitely does not fit his image. I was surprised that ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week. That is a lot. agent_2:The tip starts to break down and doesn't hold form.  Same with skates, have to keep them sharp or can't get the edge for spins and jumps. Would have to assume that Nagasu goes through a lot of skates for this reason. agent_1:I like that she wanted to do the triple axel so bad that she dreamed she could . That shows heart for wanting to do something. agent_2:Especially when she had been passed over for the previous Olympics.  Rippon omitted his quad jump at the start, not as much heart I guess. agent_1:And she is part of the record books for being the first U.S. lady to land triple axel in olympic competition. agent_2:She had her wish of making America proud.  Guess the same can't be said for the Russians because of the prior doping scandal. agent_1:Yes, the doping scandal can be hard to come back from. It is amazing the amount of doping in sports today. agent_2:You would think that rather than compromising, like the Olympic committee did, they would just start to ban them.  Isn't teaching them anything to allow certain numbers to still participate and medal. agent_1:That's true. Did you know Michael Jackson had a patent on his leaning dance move. agent_2:I didn't know that there was a device involved in it.  Wonder with his death if the patent transferred to someone? agent_1:Maybe it got passed down to his children. agent_2:He certainly was talented.  Wonder if he did his own choreography? agent_1:I think he did. He worked too hard and I think that is what caused his death. He had his whole family to take care of really. agent_2:So much control.  At least after he left Jackson 5 he had some freedom unlike the kids in K pop. Agencies controlling everything. Yikes! agent_1:That is true and to think K-pop had it's first group of women in the 60's is surprising. I thought k-pop was pretty new. agent_2:I was vaguely familiar with H.O.T. , Korean version of Backstreet Boys. Social networking and YouTube have launched a lot of the Korean Wave. agent_1:Yes and they have the loudest and most loyal fans. agent_2:I wonder if because they are now going global with this music if you will start to see fusion music.  Would mix well with Latin beats. agent_1:I like that when North korea sank a south korean warship they blasted the k-pop song hit your heart on loud speakers. agent_2:I wonder if that song was by their own K pop girl band, moranbong,  or if they selected it from someone else? agent_1:Moranbong  band was  the most popular music group in the country. They must have a lot of fans. agent_2:It is generally classified that way..K Pop.  Seems to have a more narrow sense of description and influence than back when they were around though.	agent_1:And they say with social media and tv  shows  k-pop are gaining a widespread global audience.	agent_2 likes entertainment. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['entertainment', 'music', 'Korean Wave'].
10890	agent_1:Hi, how are you? Are you a music fan? agent_2:I listen to music whenever I can! I haven't been to a concert in a minute, but I tend to really enjoy those when it's an act I'm a fan of. I can appreciate orchestra, too, though. agent_1:Same, I do like some orchestra stuff like John Williams and the guy who does the Game of Thrones music. Can't say I would ever go to an orchestra festival like Shift though. agent_2:Festivals can be very stimulating but also very underwhelming or disappointing if they're not organized correctly. It sounds like Shift was not executed as well as it could have been, even if it was well-intended. agent_1:I think I haven't been to a concert myself in over 5 years, the last one being the Foo Fighters. agent_2:I saw REO Speedwagon and Chicago back last summer, and it reminded me that those shows are NOT fun if the music isn't loud. I heard the Foo Fighters played a concert so loud in New Zealand that it registered on seismic monitors! agent_1:That's awesome! I saw the first Global Citizen concert in Central Park that had Foo Fighters, Black Keys and Neil Young. That one was amazing. Huge venue in the park. agent_2:That sounds fun--I guess that's kind of the ultimate venue for a festival. I was invited to a house concert last month and turned it down because it didn't sound fun, but there's a huge range in the kind of places you can have one. I suppose intimate venues work well for solo performances or ensembles involving instruments like pianos or violins. agent_1:Have you ever been to cgbg in NYC? The Ramones used to play there back in the day pretty often. agent_2:I'm familiar with both, but I think I'm too young to have experienced either of those things live haha.  agent_1:Me too, but I've been to cgbg before it closed down. I imagine the Ramones played a lot of similar punk rock scenes. I think I'm too old for a venue like that now haha.	agent_2:I guess the concerts that take place today aren't really the stuff of legend. For example, in 1972, Deep Purple broke the world record for loudest concert, in which three audience members were rendered unconscious.

Did you know video games were orignally used by the military?  agent_2:No I didnt, I always thought they were used for entertainment although I know the millitary use them currently agent_1:I know, it was probably for some type of war game. 	agent_2:What are your thoughts on the name ''Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Devices'' ?	agent_1 dislikes TV. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV', 'work', 'sports'].

I was not aware it had been so long. It makes me wonder how long I was on MySpace before that.   agent_2:I agree, I wonder why burger king wanted people to unfriend others  agent_1:I was not aware that they did. That's very strange. You'd think they'd rather advertise on the site since so many people are on there. Facebook makes most of it's revenue from advertisements.  agent_2:I understand that to be true also. I cant believe Iceland is using Facebook to rewrite their Constitution agent_1:That seems like a bad idea. People don't think before they type on Facebook and they're willing to be more ridiculous because they are behind a keyboard.  agent_2:Agreed. I have alsways really liked Micheal Jackson, and I knew he did work on the Simpsons agent_1:I have mixed feelings about him. As a pop star he was amazing, his personal life not so much. My understanding is that Freddie Mercury cancelled a duet with him because he insisted on bringing his llama to the studio. agent_2:Yes I understand the feelings, would have loved to see the 50 foot robot though agent_1:He had some very out there ideas.

I do, a little more than I want to though, how about you? agent_1:I sometimes use it, when i dont have time to shop. i like to check things out in the store, if possible. agent_2:It's sad but I have turned into the complete opposite! I only go to the store if it's not on amazon haha. I wish I was the first customer to buy something though! agent_1:I would rather have amazon prime for life than a building named after me.  agent_2:Haha I would like that as well haha. Can you believe how many miles a day an Amazon worker walks a day? agent_1:I think that they must lose a lot of weight, or get really bad knees LOL agent_2:I bet! I didn't even know IMDB was owned by Amazon too. They have the hand in every cookie jar haha. agent_1:Yeah, soon amazon will own everything and we will all work at amazon. 15 miles a day. can i do that at my age? LOL agent_2:I'm only 30 and am dreading that just thinking about it lol. Maybe Google will try and stop them? agent_1:Google and amazon will merge. all searches will produce amazon results. you will use your wages from google or amazon to buy goods online from amazon. agent_2:It's like the movie terminator! SKYNET IS OUT TO GET US!!!! haha it really is crazy how much stake Google has in the internet. agent_1:google dominates, but there is always some upstart that unseats the dominant firm. i wonder who that will be. agent_2:Well Google falls under Alphabet now, so I feel like they are getting prepared for that! agent_1:Yes, from A to Z, they will control everything. oh, well. i for one hail our new corporate overlords. agent_2:Apple even has a big piece of everything.

4963	agent_1:Hey how are you doing, ever have problem with the dust fallout while having your wood floors finished? agent_2:Never, lol. have you? agent_1:I haven't but if you were wondering, it's best to clean everything before you do so there is no dust to begin with. agent_2:That is a good point, start off on the right foot. I wonder if you can buy products on amazon agent_1:I'm sure you can, might be more than $27.95, that was the amount spent by the first customer on Amazon. agent_2:I heard that person got a building named after them, that would be awesome, and definitely worth the 28 dollars. I can't believe Amazon started in 1994 agent_1:For sure, started as a book store. The USPS has a contract to deliver Amazon packages on Sunday. You think Amazon is getting too big? agent_2:I think Amazon has gotten so big, but I think in a good way. I just hope they turn into a monopoly. agent_1:For sure, they kind of already are. Or at least selling all that cheap stuff kind of hurts the market overall. The warehouse workers work a ton, between 7 and 15 miles a day they walk. agent_2:I couldn't imagine walking that much per day. I would be in the best shape of my life. Did you know that amazon has another site that sells their returned goods at a discount agent_1:I was not aware of that, what it is called? Amazon owns IMDB too, that's surprising. agent_2:I don't know what it is called, I want to check it out lol. I don't mind getting an even bigger discount on amazon goods. I wonder why the own imdb agent_1:Yah, it's just out of box stuff usually. Did you know there are no snakes in New Zealand? agent_2:New Zealand sounds like the place to be, snakes scare me lol. I don't get why some snakes give birth and some lay eggs agent_1:Yah, they're pretty messed up, it is interesting to know that the fear of snakes is engrained in our brains. agent_2:snakes are crazy lol agent_1:Truly, very crazy. I'm surprised Crocodiles are more closely related to bird than snakes and lizards. agent_2:I would never have guessed that.

I wouldn't get anything done but it would be amazing lol! Did you know dogs have 12 different blood types? agent_2:I did.  I guess I should get my dog checked for her blood type next time I see the vet.  Do you have a dog? agent_1:I will have to, yes, his name is rocky, he is my favorite pet of all time, what is your dogs name? agent_2:her name is Yuki, it means snow in Japanese,  she is a white dog lol She is a rescue so we dont know the breed,  shes a mutt.  agent_1:aww that is cute, rescue dogs tend to be the best! I want to clone my dog when he passes he is that good. They have cloned cats before, but no thanks to a cat agent_2:lol that would be cool if you can clone your dog after they pass!  Ive had a few dogs and its heartbreaking.  I even took like 5 years break in between getting another one because I didnt know if I was ready.  Im not a cat person at all,  they are cute.  agent_1:ha i agree with that. In japan there are more pets that kids under 15, that is a lot of pets! agent_2:Oh wow.  I hope they aren't neglected in any way!  agent_1:I hope not! Otherwise I am going there to stop it! They should do what boulder does and make it so you don't own pets but are their guardian agent_2:Yessssss!  I think they whole world should do that!  Did you know dogs can learn over a thousand words!   agent_1:I did not know that! I know that only dogs and elephants respond to pointing, out of thousands of animals agent_2:Also,  if you actually can stop countries from eating dog,  South Korea actually sells dog meat in their street markets!  I saw it when I visited there =( it was horrifying.  Yes,  I did know that elephants and dogs are so smart. 	agent_1:that is so sad and so wrong.

What about you? agent_1:Are you kidding? its like the best show ever you should really watch it it has about 8 seasons agent_2:Haha I've been wanting to watch it. I saw Harry Lloyd is the great-great grandson of Charles Dickens. agent_1:You should watch it, and yeah the show has a great casting, its based on the novels by George R.R Martin, his a great writer.   agent_2:Very cool. I saw Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter plays Talisa. agent_1:Yeah she is one of the main characters of the show, I feel sad because the eight season is the final one so in April the beggining of the end will happen.  agent_2:Oh wow that is sad. I saw there is a Nat Geo show called Game of Lions that follows a pack of lions around. agent_1:That show must be really good, I wonder if they named the show after Game of Thrones.  agent_2:I think so. Do you know much about the universe? agent_1:I love reading about the universe its one of my passions, what about yourself?  agent_2:I feel the same way. There are scientists who think the universes evolve through natural selection like species here on Earth.  agent_1:That is an interesting theory, they might be on to something, there is also a theory that states that the universe is one giant super hologram. agent_2:Interesting...a giant hologram! I saw there are stars cold enough to be touched by human hands. agent_1:That is also a cool fact, then there's also the theory that there's only one electron in the universe.	agent_2:That is a very interesting theory.

12098	agent_1:Do you like horror films?  agent_2:Yea, I like the horror films that have macabre and supernatural themes the most agent_1:Apparently Stephen King thought Bambi was a horror movies.  agent_2:I guess King was scared when Bambi's mother was killed, or doesn't like deers agent_1:yeah, I can't remember the story to be honest. What about google, do you use it a lot?  agent_2:Yea, it's crazy a single google search using more computing power than the apollo moon missions agent_1:Interesting, I didn't realize that. How does google calculate traffic?  agent_2:I guess it uses data from peoples phones to calculate traffic, that's pretty unsettling agent_1:That is pretty cool. Did you know they have goats cut their lawn?  agent_2:I've heard that, you figure they would just use lawn mowers unless they were broke after they started in 1998	agent_1:Yeah, did you know when google went down for 5 minutes it took 40% of web traffic with it? 	agent_2 likes technology. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['technology', 'politics', 'no'].

I'd want a whole lot more than that! agent_2:ok, yes that's what I read... and somebody needs to explain to me, how using a surrogate really works... agent_1:Simple explanation:  They take egg from mom, Sperm from dad - put it together and then into another person. agent_2:ok... why are they doing that ? Kardashian can't have babies ? agent_1:Not sure to be honest, I'd love to know too though. agent_2:I think it's just another thing to do to be on the cover of the magazine and have plenty of interviews...  this is a crazy world...  agent_1:I wouldn't doubt it.

1545	agent_1:Government is fascinating. It seems so different the world over yet there are common threads in every type.  agent_2:I agree. Some governments try to help, others, not so much. agent_1:So true. I wonder what america would look like if we had a PM instead of a president. A PM seems to be held more accountable for their actions.  agent_2:True. Much easier to remove. Australia's PM position isn't in the constitution and exists only through custom. That seems strange to me. Not in the Constitution? agent_1:Australia's constitution is weird though. It doesn't protect the people as much like an american one does.  agent_2:I did not know that. Number 10 Downing Street has a cat with a title! I wonder how many other government headquarters have animals like that. agent_1:With all the historic buildings in the UK I could see why they need one. Older structures like that tend to attract rodents.  agent_2:Is one cat enough though? Might need a support staff. agent_1:Right? lol. I wonder if you can meet the cat if you tour the offices? agent_2:The cat doesn't take visitors without an appointment.	agent_1:I could see the cat being involved in a lot of the pranks the UK officials seem to play on each other. 	agent_2 likes politics. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'pets', 'pets'].

7165	agent_1:Hi! Are you familiar with Bad Times at the El Royale? I feel it basically defies expectations even though not all of its surprises are pleasant but there is satisfaction, however! agent_2:hi how are you? I have heard of it. it is a movie that came out recently, right? agent_1:Not too long ago and it's basically set in 1969 and is also kind of a B movie, black comedy and mystery! Drew Goddard directed it as well! agent_2:A B movie? Great! that sounds fun. low budget? doesnt take itself too seriously? agent_1:Exactly. So are you a horror fan in general? I watch horror films as a workout because you can burn over 180 calories just by watching them, surprisingly enough! agent_2:I thnk the first time it would burn that many, but the second time maybe not. not so scary.  agent_1:That is a good point. But you know what else is crazy, they say if you view abstract art after watching a horror film, you'll enjoy it a lot more!

948	"agent_1:Hey there, heard anything interesting lately? I sure have, did you know Amazon contributed 38 billion to the city of Seattle's economy just by being there?  agent_2:Hi, no I did not know. It looks like amazon means exciting news. They are now looking for a site for a second headquarters! agent_1:That's great! Not everyone thinks so though, Amazon can come with difficulties in transportation and shoot up the housing costs of whatever city it's in.  agent_2:They do make an impact wherever they go. I found interesting that there is a building named after the first amazon.com customer agent_1:I heard they're considering Washington as a place for their 2nd HQ, wherever they put the building is going to get a huge boost! I heard they're even considering New York! agent_2:Also Los angeles, atlanta, and Dallas. they are looking for as much as 8 million sq ft agent_1:Don't forget about their original HQ, it was founded by Jeff Bexos on July 5 1994. And it's the largest internet retailer in the world!  agent_2:An in the US they are the most valuable company after Apple and Microsoft, they have really grow so much! agent_1:It's probably thanks to their hard-workers! I heard they walk 7-15 miles each day as apart of their shift. agent_2:that is a lot! agent_1:And the CEO Jeff Bezos built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years! I guess he has the money to do so! agent_2:We can't deny he is full of great ideas. i did not know that IMBD is owned by amazon!! agent_1:Me neither! Amazon seems to have a lot of power, they have a contract with the post-office to make sure our packages get delivered even on Sunday! agent_2:that is neat. Did you know they started with being an online bookstore? agent_1:That's incredible, they also have a publishing arm known as Amazon publishing for people who want to publish their eBooks through them! agent_2:that is good! Hey, do you like animals? agent_1:I love animals, my favorite is the Shark. Did you know they can be trained just like dogs? Talk about man's best friend. agent_2:Di you know that they meet in the pacific ocean, in a place named ""white Shark cafe"". I love coffee but I would try not to end up there! agent_1:Crazy, but what's even crazier is that Shark's have no rib cages! If they were on land they'd be crushed by the weight of their own body.  agent_2:We are all afraid and even terrified of sharks, but it looks like they can rescue sailors!"	agent_1:That's probably because they evolved earlier than Dinosaurs, nature's perfect killer!	agent_2 likes nature. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['nature', 'sports', 'surfing'].

13151	agent_1:hello! how are you doing? What did you think of the article? agent_2:Not exactly one I've ever thought about for sure. agent_1:I figured we could just start by looking at the first section here. I found it really interesting about using robots to prepare Mars for human arrival. agent_2:I'd feel a lot better in a way sending robots up first to test things. But, what robots do not have are human emotions that would have to deal with such a bizarre plan. agent_1:Sorry for the delay. I was reading ahead and got distracted. I totally agree with you on that. The idea that we may only be 20 to 25 years away is crazy to me. agent_2:I just really don't see the point from what I've read here. Why travel so far to go to somewhere that has nothing to offer a human? Can't you just move to a different destination right here on Earth? Seems an awful lot to go through just to get away...no? agent_1:No it totally makes sense. I think the appeal is going somwhere we have never gone before. Still, it seems easier to make the earth more inhabitable than to move to another planet entirely. There are many areas of earth that we could spread to if we invested this level of effort. agent_2:Yep.....the Sahara desert comes to mind. As far as it making sense, I suppose, to those explorers out there who'd like that sort of thing. agent_1:Yes for sure. It is just such an interesting concept. To me it is just crazy the amount of time money and planning that goes into this kind of project. agent_2:Well, being alone and 61 years old, I'm willing to give it a shot, I would just be overly concerned about boredom! What to do with all that time on a different planet? agent_1:Right exactly. I have no idea how I would occupy myself.	agent_2:That is why I'm sure the scientists would have to put those willing through plenty of tests to see how they would handle such a change. Like I said before, sending robots first is an excellent idea. But, they can't measure a person's mind dealing with it with robots.

Interesting stuff. agent_1:Never heard that one before, lol! There is a fish called the black swallower that is capable of eating prey twice its length and 10 times its own weight. agent_2:I knew one of those in my fraternity in college I think. I was shocked to learn there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal. Only creature on earth that can claim that here on the planet. agent_1:Yeah we all know that guy! how about the loch ness monster being protected under the Scottish 1912 protection of animals act. Creatures of the great deep are extraordinary. ""The immortal Jelly fish.  agent_2:I already looked up that jellyfish on my phone. Fascinating, yes loch ness is protected and pets in Boulder, Colorado are not owned, but guarded. Interesting how different cultures handle that. agent_1:Tell me about it apparently there are more U.S. Tigers living as pets than there are living in the wild in Asia. agent_2:Yes, that is sad in some ways too. Happy we're keeping them alive, probably in zoo but going extinct in the wild is a sad statement on the planet today."	agent_1:I agree.

Directed by the coens? agent_2:No, I think I didnt watch that one, who is Coens?  agent_1:theyre brothers that direct movies together, but anyway the soundtrack is good it was certified platinum 8 times agent_2:It was pretty good, scary as well, I think the soundtrack is one of the most important factors for the success of the movie	agent_1:oh ya definitely, do you like Phil collins btw?	agent_2 likes music. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'movie', 'musician'].

What about you? agent_1:haha ya me too, sad to think that 80% of the natural forests have been destroyed though agent_2:Only 20% more to go! We are a destructive species. Can seem to protect things that we need to survive. And we've been here just a short time. agent_1:thats true, if history were a 24 hour day, humans have only taken up about 1 minute of time agent_2:The day has been getting longer. It was only 5.5 hours. Soon it'll be so long that we'll have a 20-hour workday. I bet people will want more vacation.  agent_1:that is wacky, will the day continue to get longer? like a 40 hour day at somepoint? agent_2:Maybe in billions of years. Humanity will be long gone, having cut down all the forests and filled the oceans with plastic.	agent_1:ya that is sad to think about, also sad we'll have run out of helium by the year 2100	agent_2 dislikes science. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['science', 'planet earth', 'planet earth'].

It thought that the 2 would be a lot different form each other.  agent_1:Apparently both planets have come similarities, I wonder if they will find ancient life on the planet, the 2020 mission seems like a chance to gather a lot of intel about the planet agent_2:The atmospheres have similar aerodynamic characteristics, maybe ancient Mars was a little like Earth.  agent_1:Thats an interesthing theory, I think thats possibly, did you hear about the Curiosity rover? agent_2:The Curiosity rover that landed on Mars in 2012 ? What happened to it ? agent_1:Nothing, just that it weighted less than the 2020 rover although I did hear it had some troubles	agent_2:I suppose that id they want to analyse more stuff, they have to bring more instruments, therefore it is heavier.

Do you like movies? agent_2:I like movies, it is a form of art. .  agent_1:This is interesting..Even though spartacus had a cinematographer, stanley kubrick took the camera away from him and did it himself.  agent_2:You have to do it yourself, he was very talented, I saw some of his films, but never Spartacus, is it good ?  agent_1:It is! But this is interesting too..even though he did almost none of the work, when spartacus got the academy award for best cinematography, it went to the credited cinematographer, and not kubrick. agent_2:Probably, some kind of union thing, like he was not an official cinematographer.  I wonder if they gave him something for it.  agent_1:Thats a good question! No woman has ever been nominated for the academy award for best cinematography. agent_2:I guess it is because there is not many female cinematographer because they would not hire them. Sexism still exist.  agent_1:That is terrible. A woman has never even been nominated. agent_2:Yeah, do you see movies made by a woman ? agent_1:I haven't paid attention to that. I'll have to now. Cinematographer roger deakins has been nominated 13 times for the best cinematography oscar, and has never won. agent_2:He was good but not enough, did he do any comedies ? I like those kind of film.  agent_1:I don't think he did. Do you like Bill murray?

But I never saw kung fu hustle. Did you ? agent_1:no, not my type of movie! I do like Jack black though. The green lantern film was originally going to be a comedy starring jack black agent_2:That would have changed the tone of the movie, he is very slapstick.  agent_1:Some of his stuff is good, Some bad. Did you watch 3rd rock from the sun?  agent_2:I did when I was young, it was good but not memorable, not like Seinfeld.  agent_1:3rd rock from the sun won the golden globe for best comedy series in 1997, beating seinfeld, friends, and frasier."	agent_2:That is surprising and not surprising at the same time, we don't know what will stand the test of time, disco was not forever. 	agent_1 dislikes music. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'movie', 'movie cinematographer'].

That was in the year 1991 agent_1:Yes, I think I read $270 million in box office. agent_2:Yeah, that was a total success so do you like comedy films as well agent_1:I love comedy. It's my favorite. agent_2:Do you like Bill Murray? he seems to like Kung Fu hustle a lot.  agent_1:I do like him but I don't know kung fu hustle. agent_2:He says is the supreme achievement of modern comedy, well I dont agree with that, I didnt like that movie really agent_1:I totally agree with you. agent_2:Do you like the channel Comedy Central? agent_1:I have watched a few shows on there. My son loves it. agent_2:I love it as well but it makes me mad that they've cancelled over 100 shows since its creation agent_1:I would think that what is funny changes over time."	agent_2:Yeah I guess so but many of those shows were good! anyways its been nice chatting with you today	agent_1 likes TV shows. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV shows', 'movie', 'actor'].
3249	"agent_1:Would you much of a baseball fan? agent_2:A little.  I just read something about the Boston Red Sox.  They has some hard core fans. agent_1:I guess they are doing well at the moment.  they went so long without winning anything and now they can't stop. agent_2:Yeah. Mookie Betts seems to really be getting some distance on his hits.  agent_1:That's a new name to me, seems like a name from a Star Wars movie.  I wonder if they are the best team in baseball right now? agent_2:I really don't know.  They have a picture named Porcello that is really good.  It sounds like they have a good balance between pitching and hitting. agent_1:I'm originally from a different country but my wife is from Cleveland.  She used to get very excited in the late nineties when they had a good team. agent_2:That's cool.  I guess FanGraphs estimates that the Red Sox have a 71% chance to win the division.  That's good for your wife.  What country are you from? agent_1:England, been here over twenty years.  Have not really got into baseball, went to a few games in the past at Camden Yard and Jacobs Field. agent_2:Well, a very belated ""welcome"".  Are you a cricket fan?  I didn't realize that the NYT owned part of the Sox.  "	agent_1:I am, used to play to a fairly high level.  Isn't that sacrilege for the NYT to be involved with Boston, or are they just hedging their bets.	agent_2 dislikes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'hitting', 'Mookie Betts'].
2726	agent_1:Hi!  Do you watch the news? agent_2:Yes I love watching the news. How about you? agent_1:I love the information, but everything these days is so slanted from both sides sometimes it is hard to get. agent_2:Right there is not one source out there that you can trust. I hate the news outlets, but still need to see what's going on. agent_1:Much agreed.  I find that the truth lies somewhere in the middle.  The media tries to create outrage for their ratings. agent_2:Exactly. That's why I watch both CNN and Fox. It kind of helps me to sort through the muck. agent_1:Fox is watched more than Cnn and MSNBC combined.  Kinda crazy to think that. agent_2:I think Fox is slightly more honest than the other two. agent_1:Fox news threatened to sue the simpsons over their constant parody. agent_2:I didn't know that. I don't watch the Simpsons. I know CNN is whining because they can't get any conservative guests. Why would you want to go on their show and be abused. agent_1:Why would a liberal news network want a conservative guest? agent_2:I think so that they can attempt to make them look like a liar or a fool or whatever negative thing they can think of. agent_1:That is true. Did you hear about that time in 1957 when Truman refused to be photographed with Dumbo agent_2:No I didn't. That's funny. Maybe Dumbo wasn't crazy about the idea either. agent_1:Yeah.  Maybe they should have brought Eeyore out agent_2:Okay you've got me there, who's Eeyore.	agent_1:He is the Donkey from winnie the pooh.	agent_2 likes animals. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['animals', 'TV', 'movie'].
6606	agent_1:Are you on Facebook by any chance? agent_2:yes , I found it interesting that mark zukerburg suffers from colorblindness  agent_1:I was not aware of that. Facebook debuted in 2004. I was not aware it had been so long. It makes me wonder how long I was on MySpace before that.   agent_2:I agree, I wonder why burger king wanted people to unfriend others  agent_1:I was not aware that they did. That's very strange. You'd think they'd rather advertise on the site since so many people are on there. Facebook makes most of it's revenue from advertisements.  agent_2:I understand that to be true also. I cant believe Iceland is using Facebook to rewrite their Constitution agent_1:That seems like a bad idea. People don't think before they type on Facebook and they're willing to be more ridiculous because they are behind a keyboard.  agent_2:Agreed. I have alsways really liked Micheal Jackson, and I knew he did work on the Simpsons agent_1:I have mixed feelings about him. As a pop star he was amazing, his personal life not so much. My understanding is that Freddie Mercury cancelled a duet with him because he insisted on bringing his llama to the studio. agent_2:Yes I understand the feelings, would have loved to see the 50 foot robot though agent_1:He had some very out there ideas. I did know that Eddie Van Halen Played the guitar solo in Beat It free of charge. agent_2:I did not know that either. and that Micheal helped write the soundtrack to sonic 3 agent_1:That seems very odd to me. Thinking back to the Sonic games they do not have music that I would have thought a high profile musician made.  agent_2:I would agree with that, but still good music. I knoew taylor swift removed her music from spotify but not pandora  agent_1:I wonder why? I use Pandora a lot. I often have it on when I exercise. They have a net income of $-16 million despite having $274 million in revenue. I really think they need to look into their overhead cost.   agent_2:I would agree. I know she didnt like how they pay artist. I did not know they were streaming comedy also agent_1:I didn't either. I have never tried to use it for that. I use Podcast apps for that purpose. I'll have to look into that.  agent_2:They have plenty of streams at 168 million steams for Aloe Blacc agent_1:That's a huge amount of streams. I did not realize until recently that Pandora was only available in the United States. I find that surprising.  agent_2:me too I found the music genome project interesting to learn about also	agent_1:Algorithms are always interesting to me. 	agent_2 likes technology. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['technology', 'video games', 'video games'].
6394	agent_1:Good morning! How are you today? I am sure glad baseball season is back! Are you familiar with the game? agent_2:I played when I was younger.  agent_1:I wish I played, but only neighborhood games. Do you follow any baseball now? I find it amusing that MLB team managers wear uniforms because they can play if needed. agent_2:I follow the Nationals, what about you?  agent_1:I follow the Chicago Cubs. Have you heard about the guy that found the hidden baseball cards? agent_2:Yeah, apparently they were worth millions of dollars.  agent_1:Yes! Hidden away in his grandfathers attic since the 1940's. I wonder if the grandfather forgot them, or hid them so someone would get a big surprise? agent_2:I'm not sure. It has me thinking about the time my mom threw away my card collection.  agent_1:Oh, hopefully no good ones. Isn't it funny that soccer-baseball is the name for kickball in Canada. agent_2:Yeah, that is pretty funny. Is it a big sport up there?  agent_1:I am no sure. I know in Japan baseball is super popular. agent_2:I've known that for awhile. I'm surprised they don't know it is popular over here though.  agent_1:I know! That shocks me too.  agent_2:Are you a fan of the World Series?  agent_1:Yes, I am. As a Cubs fan it has been difficult. Prior to the 2016 win the Ottoman Empire was still in existence the last time they won. agent_2:Interesting. Did you know the cubs were the first team to win back to back world series. 	agent_1:Yes!

4813	"agent_1:How familiar are you with the hunting and gathering culture people used to have? agent_2:Not too familiar,      Although I've read a bit from researcher Nicole Kruspe discussing odor. agent_1:Although our sense of smell may not be as developed as some species, odor played an essential role in our survival. However, odor is unique in that people don't name the specific odor itself, but rather what it reminds us of. agent_2:Interesting.   Western scholars dismissed scents as unknowable, or at least unnameable for millenia. agent_1:True, but recent studies by Majid found that the Jahai, who are hunter gatherers still, are able to identify these odors by abstract names. It seems that these hunter gathers & horticulturalists can identify odors, unlike the rest of their world due to their unique cirucmstances. agent_2:True, Kruspe and Majid propose that, when people settle into, say, horticulture or postindustrial society, other senses become relatively more important than smell.  agent_1:McGann states that this ability to distinguish the differences in odor receptors would play a greater role in a more natural, wild environment than the secure urban areas that most horicultural people live. While distinquishing complex smells may save a hunter/gather's life in the wild, it would be as much a life or death situation in most instances in an urban setting. In fact, simple odors like smelling sulfur are enough for most people to avoid dangerous situations. agent_2:Did you know that Humans (taxonomically, Homo sapiens) are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina. agent_1:I recently read that the defining characteristics of Hominina are bipedal locomotion, high dexterity, complex brains, and complex language. agent_2:Early hominins‚ particularly the australopithecines, whose brains and anatomy are in many ways more similar to ancestral non-human apes‚ are less often referred to as ""human."" agent_1:True, but because evolutionary development is progressive, it is diffiult to define cleanly where it is apes stop being apes and became humans instead. Considering some of these early hominins were capable of using fire, displaying high intelligence, I believe they should still be consider humans or at least an early precusor. agent_2:True, they gave rise to anatomically modern Homo sapiens in Africa about 315,000 years ago agent_1:Rather than simply anatomy, I believe the social behaviors and communication is what distinguishes modern human. While most early hominins were capable of using tools, homo sapiens were able to use societys for protection and use their advance communication to capture even the most abstract of concepts for the exponential accumulation and spread of knowledge. agent_2:Did you know that If earth's entire history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds. agent_1:I only happened upon that information on a Did you know? video. What advantages do you believe allowed us to dominate within this small window in history? agent_2:Advantages that explain this evolutionary success include a relatively larger brain with a particularly well-developed neocortex, prefrontal cortex which enable high levels of abstract reasoning and language agent_1:Although early hominins have similar adaptations, what do you believe made us stand out and survive while the others didn't?"	agent_2:A silly one is that Humans are the only mammals that can't breathe and swallow at the same time	agent_1 likes humans. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['humans', 'hominin', 'adaptations'].

They have so many subscribers that they take up around a third of all bandwidth used at night! agent_2:That's a lot, apparently they and youtube make up half of internet traffic during peek time in North America. agent_1:That's incredible. I only started using them a few years ago but I think they've been around since 1997.  agent_2:I've been a loyal customer since then and they have come a long way from the B-movie streaming they use to do.  agent_1:Yeah, they have a bunch of original series now! agent_2:I know blockbuster has to be kicking themselves for not purchasing when they had the chance. agent_1:Definitely! They could have bought it for only $50 million.  agent_2:Right and to think they are worth 2 billion. I just watch the avenger infinity war on there. im a big marvel fan.  agent_1:I haven't seen a lot of the Marvel movies,was it good? agent_2:Awesome!! you know hasting got the idea after he had to pay a large late fee.  agent_1:I heard it was a $40 fee or so. I feel his pain. I did that a time or two myself back then.  agent_2:Finally it got so bad i just had to find another store to rent from, haha! of the 137 million subscribers you mentioned, i believe that about 58 million are in the US. agent_1:That's cool that they have a large international presence. They have offices in Japan and Brazil, too.  agent_2:Yeah that's right and i think their first series was called Lilyhammer. an oxymoron if i ever heard one. agent_1:True! I think that was made in 2012. agent_2:Since then it's like they have a new show new movie every other week. agent_1:It certainly seems that way. Some of them are really good, though!

How about you? agent_1:I like jazz, especially cool jazz.  agent_2:Do you know where jazz first originated? agent_1:I guess the United States, but I don't know where in the US, do you ? agent_2:Yeah you are right!  It was way down south in New Orleans!  Back in the late 19th and early 20th c.  agent_1:Oh so New Orleans music could be considered as Jazz ? It is very upbeat. Do you like that style of music ? agent_2:Yeah I would definitely say that it would be jazz!  I really like that style myself, how about you?  Have you ever visited New Orleans? agent_1:No never, is it worth it ? It seems that every city has its style of jazz even Kansas City.   agent_2:That is very true, Kansas city jazz is much more hard-swinging and bluesy, so cool how different regions have different styles.  agent_1:Do you think gypsies have anything to do with Gypsy Jazz ? I have never heard of any gypsies communities on US soil.  agent_2:I am not sure, that sounds more like an eastern european type jazz with the musette waltzes, very interesting though.  agent_1:But I a more interested in ""challenging"" jazz styles, the less ""dance-able"" the better it is for me.  agent_2:Interesting, did you know that Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is super popular?"	agent_1:Yes, I have heard of it,  if jazz is new to them, they have 100 years of jazz music to play to their audience. 	agent_2 likes music. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'jazz orchestra', 'music'].

King Zeno is one hell of a scary novel, not apt for everyone agent_1:For sure, it is about a century old but still so scary. Do you like to listen to jazz music? agent_2:I love it yeah, what about you? do you like the genre agent_1:Not a huge fan but a fan of the historic value of jazz, there's so many types of jazz like swing, Kansas City Jaz, and Gypsy jazz. What other kind of music do you like? agent_2:It has deep roots that go almost a hundred years ago, it means a lot to many people, nice tunes and melody agent_1:For sure, Clint Eastwood is a lifelong jazz fan, which is pretty surprising to be honest given his previous roles. agent_2:Really his a fan? well he has great musical taste then, I hear Pakistan has a great Jazz orchestra	agent_1:I would never have guessed that.

10496	agent_1:Hi, do you use Amazon? agent_2:Hi, are you interested in Google, Amazon, or Artificial Intelligence? agent_1:All three of those actually. They are two of the biggest innovators we have and one of the most interesting scientific fields. agent_2:Yes, I agree. I really enjoy AI although all three of these topics are probably so interrelated that we don't realize it. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is sometimes called machine intelligence (which is actually demonstrated by the machines) in contrast to human intelligence. agent_1:Yes it is amazing what we can hopefully apply AI to in the future. It can really help out with some difficult tasks. agent_2:I took Computer Science in college and it is defined as the study of 'intelligent agents' or any device that perceives the environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. agent_1:I only took a basic Computer Science course, we never delved into Artificial Intelligence. I don't know too much about it besides some basic reading. agent_2:I learned some stuff in Master's level courses and colloquially, the term 'artificial intelligence' is applied when a machine mimics 'cognitive functions' that humans associate with other human minds such as 'learning' and 'problem solving'. agent_1:What do you think the biggest priority should be in the application of Artificial Intelligence? agent_2:Actually, the scope of AI is disputed as machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered as requiring 'intelligence' are often removed from the definition, a phenomenon known as the AI effect, leading to the quip in Teslar's Theorem, 'AI is whatever hasn't been done yet.' agent_1:I know some people are afraid of AI and think machines will become too self aware. I don't think we will ever run into that problem, science fiction has made people too paranoid. agent_2:I totally agree with that since machines are run on computer programs that humans wrote.  Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems such as chess and Go. agent_1:I know I have lost my fair share of chess games to a computer, I even saw a computer compete at very high levels at Jeopardy. It only slipped up when questions were worded somewhat ambiguously. agent_2:Yes, computers could NEVER actually think like humans can although they can autonomously operate cars, provide intelligent routing in content delivery networks and military simulations. agent_1:Yes they can really help us out when the task is something that lends itself to automation but not when there are moral or ethical complications. agent_2:Very true. Did you know that Stanford's free AI class uses Google plus Hangouts to help them teach more effectively? agent_1:I did not know that, I have used Google Hangouts for interviews and meetings. We even used it once for a fantasy football draft that a lot of people couldn't attend in person. agent_2:Awesome use of it. Did you know that there is a non-profit organization for the advancement of Artificial Intelligence?	agent_1:That's great, it's an area that we should definitely fund as there are a lot of great applications of the technology.

However, the Chicago Cubs were somewhat ""cursed."" agent_2:For this only the cubs did not play in a world series again until 2016. agent_1:It was right after a refusal towards a man with a smelly goat going into the stadium. agent_2:Yes, I hear the new.

I never knew that baseball managers could actually play for their team. That's why they wear uniforms, duh agent_1:Yeah, it's easier to just watch the highlight reel. The managers probably played way back in the day. Now? It would be sad. I'd want my money back. agent_2:Haha yep they would probably get injured really quickly LOL have you ever played kickball when you were a kid agent_1:I played kickball. Safer than dodgeball, that's for sure. agent_2:Yep I agree with you there. In Canada they call kickball soccer-baseball instead, it doesn't quite have the same ring LOL agent_1:It sure doesn't. That's clunky name. Baseball is so popular in Japan that many fans are surprised to discover it's  america's national pastime. I wonder why? The sport started here. agent_2:I agree with you. It's very screwy that they would not realize that LOL oh, did you hear about the man who found millions of dollars of baseball cards and his grandfather's attic?

One thing I don't understand is why the MLB used a married couple for 24 years to schedule all their games, why wouldn't they use a computer agent_1:The couple probably used some kind of technology, but I bet they had a friend at the MLB head office.

I wonder if they do that more in Japan where they take the game more seriously agent_1:I hear that they are surprised to know that baseball is an american thing lol  agent_2:Yeah it seems so. Do you know who used to do the scheduling for the major league games? agent_1:Not sure,  who?  A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in an attic!!  lucky guy! agent_2:Yeah that is amazing. It was a couple who did it for 24 years in a row agent_1:Wow, the must really love baseball!  That is a lot of time dedicated to the sport,  that is really sweet that they had something they were both passionate about though.  agent_2:Exactly because scheduling 2430 games every year is no easy feat agent_1:I know right!  Probably after a few years they developed a working system or a program. agent_2:Yeah that is a high possibility too. Do you know when the World Series was founded?	agent_1:No I dont.  When?

5705	agent_1:Hi how are you today? Are you registered to vote? agent_2:I am, how about you? agent_1:Yes I am too. Did you know that Not all men in the uk had the right to vote until 1918. agent_2:I didn't know that but I do know that  this country still engages is voter suppression; not much has changed over the years with the GOP agent_1:Here is a crazy fact. 34% of the black male population in alabama has permanently lost the right to vote. agent_2:Yeah because they are all convicted felons; time to change that law for sure agent_1:Yes lol How about we change the subject. Do you like disney movies? I love them. agent_2:I do...I watch them with the kids; Which is your favorite? agent_1:I cant say. I like more than 1 the most. What about you? agent_2:I love Lion King; I try to watch it once a year with the family agent_1:Aww yes I guess if I had to pick it would be Snow White. Theres karma in a cartoon. lol agent_2:Did you ever see Frozen? agent_1:Absolutely . I have to small nieces and I can sing all the songs just like them . Hey do u think you will vote in the next election? agent_2:I am going to let the GOP know I am not happy one bit and vote on the other side of the aisle agent_1:Yep. Its crazy but since 1928  The last time a republican was elected president without a nixon or bush on the ticket was 1928 agent_2:I don't like the head of the party...lol agent_1:Is that true?  agent_2:Absolutely, I don't agree with the job Trump is doing. agent_1:Very true.

6097	agent_1:Hello, are you a baseball fan? agent_2:I do not know much about baseball but I have been to a bunch of games, including a few Yankee games. It does have the second highest attendance. agent_1:Baseball games are fun to go to but they take a long time. I usually end up walking around the concourse for a couple innings. agent_2:I never knew why baseball managers wore uniforms. I thought it was just to blend in with the team and support the team. Ends up they are able to play if the need arises. agent_1:Looking at some of the managers today I think it's more of a tradition now. I know in the past there were a few times where there were actual player/coaches. I believe Ted Williams was one. agent_2:I found it very surprising that a married couple had been scheduling all 2430 major league baseball games up until 2005. I figured it was just a computer. agent_1:Baseball is deep into it's tradition. They probably didn't worry about any form of software until it became too complicated. agent_2:You're right. That's probably why baseball cards are so popular too, tradition. A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in his grandfathers attic. agent_1:Also the market was not as saturated back then as it is today, now so many different companies make cards that there isn't a chance for them to be as rare. agent_2:I never knew that is why the old ones are so valuable. I thought it was simply the popularity of the player. In Japan baseball is so popular fans do not realize it is actually America's pastime. I wonder what their baseball cards go for. agent_1:It's interesting when a Japanese player wants to play in the MLB. The team gets money for that player leaving. agent_2:I did not know that. In Canada kickball is called soccer-baseball. Odd how a different country views baseball. agent_1:I wonder if they have any different rules than we do? It would be interesting to see if they put their own twist on the game. agent_2:When I think of baseball, I think of countries like Japan and America. I don't really think of Canada and I especially do not think of the Ottoman Empire which were still in existence the last time the Chicago Cubs won the world series.	agent_1:It's also very popular in Latin America.

7478	agent_1:hey did you know that when I cat gets to be 15 years old, it has on average slept for about 10 years, so 2/3 of its lifespan agent_2:That doesn't surprise me actually.  i saw something funny the other day that in Japan that have what is called Cat Cafe's where people pay hourly to play with cats agent_1:ha that is crazy, I just got back from a pet store and held a dog actually, I'm not much of a cat person, are you? agent_2:No, I'm not but was reading an article where the town of Talkeetna, AL has had a cat named Stubbs as it's mayor since 1997 agent_1:that is funny, I like the movie the Godfather a lot, apparently the cat used in the beginning scenes was found on the set and was actually a stray agent_2:What about birds. do you like them?  I think hummingbirds are amazing.  They steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nest agent_1:haha that is funny, I do like birds, I think it would be scary to be in Austrailia and birds there can mimic different sounds, like you're walking along and think someone is chasing you with a chainsaw, but it's just a bird making that sound haha	agent_2:wow that would be scary!

We gotta start looking for some tall people to run in 2020 agent_2:lol, Using the lottery to appoint leaders is scary like they did in ancient Athens!  agent_1:Very true.  I wouldnt just want any random politician in charge. agent_2:True, They thought it would lead to oligarchy.	agent_1:It could have.

11664	agent_1:How ya doing? Have you heard of the author Henry Thoreau? His novel about trees sounds exciting. agent_2:Yeah it does... who would of thought a book about trees could be interesting?! agent_1:Yeah my thoughts indeed. I love trees and nature. It's a shame that more than 80% of our forests have been destroyed. agent_2:Yeah i agree... i really hate when they build developments they chop down all the trees leaving none! :( agent_1:Yeah so sad. Earth is always changing. By the end of this century it will be helium free! agent_2:That's weird that the hudson bay area in canada has less gravity? agent_1:Oh I didn't know that. What is crazy is that a day used to be only 5.5 hours when the earth was first formed. agent_2:WOW... could you imagine?  LOL agent_1:No that would change a lot for sure! I love looking at the stars too. Astronomers detected building blocks of life in a planetary system 455 light years away! agent_2:Really... how is it possible to see and collect data from that far away?	agent_1:Yeah I would like to know that myself.

6163	"agent_1:Hi! I recently learned that baseball managers are required to wear uniforms as well because they have to technically play should there be a need. So that must mean, they must stay in shape too right? agent_2:that is interesting, do you think they ever played in a game ? agent_1:I don't think so, I don't watch too much baseball and I don't collect cards either, but I might reconsider seeing how valuable they are when a man found three million dollars worth of cards in his grandfather's attic! agent_2:I had heard about that, imagine being set for life overnight like that! agent_1:How would you sell it? I imagine the buyers would be a small population. agent_2:I suppose so, do you think he took a loss in value trying to sell them for what he could get? agent_1:I think I would and I wonder if he knew the value when he sold them. If he didn't that would be very painful. agent_2:That really would be sad if someone exploited him agent_1:Do you have a favorite baseball team? Mine is the Yankees. agent_2:I am not too into baseball, but who is the ""lost"" yankees player? agent_1:Yeah that's a little frightening and do they mean ""lost"" as in lost his way because of the fame or ""lost"" as in missing? agent_2:I am not sure, I just know there is a lost one. I heard once they suspended mattingly because he would not get a haircut agent_1:The players to don a certain haircut? That's pretty strict! I wonder whether or not people still try to sneak into those games like what Bill O' Reilly did with the fake press pass. That's pretty smart since computers and photoshop didn't seem to be too popular back then. agent_2:That is true, you can get away with a lot back then, now we know too much! agent_1:Yeah, have you ever been to a live game? agent_2:i have not, I know it is America's pastime though! agent_1:I would argue that it was football! I didn't know there was a women's world cup has well and it even had higher television ratings than the world series! agent_2:I would as well, but apparently it is very popular in japan as well! agent_1:I wonder when they carried the flag upside down in the 1992 world series, whether or not that was the doing of Japan."	agent_2:Maybe it is because it was the canadian flag?	agent_1 dislikes flag. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['flag', 'entertainment', 'entertainment'].
13901	agent_1:Do you like sharks?  agent_2:I think they're one of the most interesting animals on the planet plus I enjoy watching Shark Week, how about you? agent_1:I rarely watch it. But it seems like a cool show, what channel is it on?  agent_2:It's on Discovery Channel. It's a yearly event they have with all different sorts of shows that they air. agent_1:I don't think I have that channel. Did you know sharks rescue sailors?  agent_2:I never knew that, I only thought it was dolphins that did that. That is an interesting behavior for a predator. agent_1:It sort of sounds not real to me.  agent_2:Yeah I kind of have a hard time believing it as well. I like watching some of the crazy movies they have made about sharks like The Meg or Sharknado as well. agent_1:Did you know sharks can be trained like dogs to bark?  agent_2:I did not know that. That's another shark fact that I have some skepticism about! agent_1:Yeah, I have a lot of them to be honest. Apparently they also evolved earlier than dinosaurs.  agent_2:That one I can believe, they have been around is some form for a long time. The Megaladon was a huge ancient shark. They think the Great White caused it's extinction because they were smaller and able to get to prey better. agent_1:What about dogs, are you a fan of dogs?  agent_2:I am a big dog person, I have one of my own. I'm allergic to cats so they were never really an option for me. agent_1:I'm allergic to cat hair too! agent_2:Do you have any pets of your own? agent_1:Nah, that is too much of a hassle. Did you know that google prefers dogs to cats?  agent_2:I think dogs are the more social animal so it makes sense for a company to have a dog policy over a cat policy. I know of a few people who have therapy dogs that go to hospitals or even to libraries so that children with reading problems can read out loud to them without feeling embarrassed. agent_1:This is true. By the way did you know that there are 12 different blood types that a dog can have? 	agent_2:I did not know that.

A PM seems to be held more accountable for their actions. 	agent_2:True. Much easier to remove. Australia's PM position isn't in the constitution and exists only through custom.

Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis by famous player rene ""the crocodile"" lacoste. i love their colgne for men agent_2:Intresting, the longest match played in a polo shirt was 22 hours agent_1:yeah if i recall it went over three days or so agent_2:That's a long time, I don't think I've ever done anything for 3 days straight agent_1:im not sure if its true but Us open quarterfinalist gael monfils beat the ""roger federer of paddle tennis"" after learning how to play just days earlier. agent_2:Man that's crazy, almost as crazy as using a helicopter to dry grass tennis courts agent_1:yeah i have heard that as well and though it sounded really dangerous. i wonder if their were people in the crowd? agent_2:I hope not, if I was there I'd be cold"	agent_1:yeah.

Astronauts are so cool, they vote from space agent_1:Every vote counts lol  agent_2:It sure does. In the UK not all men were able to vote until 1918 agent_1:Thats weird.  I wonder why that was.  Did you know the us sante used the same gavel for 165 years! agent_2:Yeah until Nixon broke it. I wonder if they were mad at him for that agent_1:haha,  maybe he just had to pay for a new gavel.  agent_2:Maybe. In Alabama sadly a large portion of the male balck population cannot vote agent_1:Wow,  permanently too.  I wonder if thats due to people in jail?  Maybe? agent_2:I think that is what it is. On the other hand in Texas seems people are more interested in voting to change the name of the garbage dump agent_1:That seems so dumb to me,  are there not more important things to vote on?  Also,  that is so negative towards that person,  arent we voting to make things better,  for positve outcomes.   agent_2:Yeah go figure. In Senate women were not allowed to wear pants until lately agent_1:Yikes they must have been cold!  I wonder why the topic of women wearing pants is such a big deal in that time.  agent_2:Well, it is about equality and they must have opposed it until those two senators decided to protest by wearing pants. Good for them agent_1:Heres a fun fact,  Every us pres who had a beard was republican lol  agent_2:Cool. And we have either had a republican and democrat president since 1853 agent_1:Yeah thats interesting!  Looks like Truman refused to take a pic with Dumbo when he was at Disneyland so it wouldnt be associated with republicans.  Why does dumbo related to republicans?  do you know? agent_2:Yeah the Republican logo is an elephant and Dumbo is a baby elephant so I guess he did not want to be associated with that agent_1:Oh wow lol But its just Disneyland lol 	agent_2:I know right?

Apparently publishers were not a fan when it was first being sent out for publication.  agent_2:Interesting. There is a university where you can study science fiction and fantasy literature with a concentration in Tolkien studies. agent_1:That would be an amazing class! I think there is so much to be learned from those great books.  agent_2:I think so too. Jim Henson created The Dark Crystal with the idea that it was unhealthy for children never to be afraid. agent_1:Hmm I could see that being true. If children have no fear then they are liable to get into anything. Healthy fear isn't a bad thing.  agent_2:I agree. Do you like Walt Disney? agent_1:I like some of their stuff. A few things are a bit underhandedly political for my taste but most is good. You? agent_2:Yep, I like Walt Disney. The Disney channel doesn't accept outside ads. Did you know that? agent_1:I didn't know that. Makes sense though because then they can direct traffic toward their products and shows.  agent_2:Yep I agree. Walt Disney and Salvador Dali once collaborated on a short film. agent_1:That is awesome. i think my favorie disney film would have to be either big hero 6 or the incredibles.  agent_2:Yea those are both good ones.

Tennis is fun too. a black man won the us open in 1968 and no other black man has since then. That would be award worthy agent_2:Yes they should make a movie about him! it's interesting to that until 1978 you could use any object as a tennis racket, that sounds dangerous agent_1:That would be hilarious to see what some  people came up with. What would  you use? lol agent_2:I would use a rocket launcher LOL just kidding. do you watch soccer at all? Apparently soccer makes more than all other sports combined agent_1:Lol that would be perfect, no opponent means you  win everytime!  agent_2:That's a great point! Did you know that table tennis is the name of the actual sport, and that ping pong is only the name of the company that sells the table tennis equipment? agent_1:I did not know that, wow! Mind blown! Back to soccer, did you have a favorite team in the world cup? agent_2:No I don't. I really don't like soccer I think it's boring LOL it's weird to me that the Super Bowl is smaller than soccer's biggest events agent_1:it is boring, but it is kind of fun to watch one week per 4 years lol. I liked Brazil agent_2:Well soccer is a good exercise though, apparently a player will run about 7 miles per game, that's good for burning calories agent_1:so good, they always have tight bodies lol. There was a german soccer player who donated 300000 euros to help pay for surgeries in brazil agent_2:That's really nice of him! What a nice guy, why do you think Greenland can't join FIFA?

Did you know that until 1978, a tennis player could use any object as a racket? agent_1:Nice!  I wonder if anyone ever tried to use something wacky?  A black man won the 1st US open tennis title in 1968 and no black man has won it since. agent_2:Wow! Not since 1968? You know, Serena Williams has increasingly found her voice and spoken out against gender and racial inequality.  agent_1:Yes!  Did you know that she speaks fluent French and Italian, as does her sister Venus! agent_2:She is truly fascinating! She does it all! She is the first tennis player, male or female, to achieve the career Golden Slam in both singles and doubles. That means she won at least one Australian Open title, French Open title, Wimbledon title, US Open title, and Olympic Gold medal. agent_1:That's pretty incredible!  They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US Open. agent_2:That's a little before Serena's time! Although, did you know she went pro in tennis at the age of 13?! I could barely even get a ball over the net when I was 13! agent_1:lol  I do remember that.  Both her and her sister brought alot of good publicity to the sport. agent_2:That is for sure! Two girls from Compton came and conquered! In total, Serena has been Number 1 for 319 weeks!  agent_1:That is incredible!  The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days.  Wow! agent_2:Are you kidding me! Three days?! That's a long time! I don't have that kind of patience! Speaking of long records... did you know the longest point in pro tennis history was a 643 shot rally?  agent_1:Wow!  That would have been fun to watch...not so fun for the players. lol agent_2:Yeah! It lasted 29 minutes! I bet it was pretty exhilarating, but also probably pretty exhausting! I would certainly be out of breath after 29 minutes!	agent_1:lol me too.

I didn't know Ricky Gervais was a pop singer in the 80s, it's hard to imagine agent_2:i know ! i never would have thought that either! agent_1:Apparently scientist voted ""We are the Champions"" as the catchiest pop song, I wonder how they came up with that agent_2:im not sure , but they are probably right. agent_1:I guess they concluded that pop has grown louder and increasingly musically homogeneous since the mid-1960s agent_2:yes and in  2002 CREED ocncert was so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band! wow ! agent_1:I don't blame them, I don't much like Creed myself. agent_2:yes they are !, it was great talking to you about music, i loved it , thank you  agent_1:No problem.

I wonder if you can buy products on amazon agent_1:I'm sure you can, might be more than $27.95, that was the amount spent by the first customer on Amazon. agent_2:I heard that person got a building named after them, that would be awesome, and definitely worth the 28 dollars. I can't believe Amazon started in 1994 agent_1:For sure, started as a book store. The USPS has a contract to deliver Amazon packages on Sunday. You think Amazon is getting too big? agent_2:I think Amazon has gotten so big, but I think in a good way. I just hope they turn into a monopoly. agent_1:For sure, they kind of already are. Or at least selling all that cheap stuff kind of hurts the market overall. The warehouse workers work a ton, between 7 and 15 miles a day they walk. agent_2:I couldn't imagine walking that much per day. I would be in the best shape of my life. Did you know that amazon has another site that sells their returned goods at a discount agent_1:I was not aware of that, what it is called?

I guess the dogs are ok with having a needle in their leg.  agent_1:I guess so, some of them might be afraid, you know Google prefers dogs over cats, they are a dog company. agent_2:It's probably easier to manage dogs in an office space. Cats won't stay put.  agent_1:I agree but cats spend like 66% of their lives sleeping, when they reach the age of 15 they have spent 10 of those years sleeping. agent_2:When they're asleep, they're easy to manage. Once they're awake, they wander and explore. Cats would be great if they would sit at a computer and surf the Internet. Istanbul has vending machines that reward dogs for collecting recycled bottles. agent_1:I wonder if thats an effective system, I think it might work and its a way to reduce costs for sure. agent_2:I've never been to a cat cafe.

I guess the cats get along with each other and don't have a problem with people trying to pet them. agent_1:Yeah I guess cats are popular in those countries, there is an author that published his cat as the coauthor of his book. agent_2:I think he wanted to use the word ""we"" in the paper, so he included his cat as an author. I wonder how a cat got to be the mayor of a town."	agent_1:I bet the other politicians were really bad lol, still think mayor Stubbs will do a better work than most politicians.	agent_2 likes politics. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'pets', 'blood types'].

Did you know that The Lion King was the first Disney film to be dubbed in Zulu for it's African release? agent_2:Yes i know a little bit this film Directed by Roger Allers, Rob Minkoff. With Matthew Broderick is it right. agent_1:I'm honestly not sure who directed it. I was quite young when it came out. The main character was Simba, a lion. Speaking of directors, did you know that Frozen was the first animated Disney film directed by a woman.  agent_2:yes,Frozen, for which she earned an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Lee is the first female director agent_1:Yes that is correct. I'm glad to see that they did that but sad that it took them so long. I see a lot of Disney toys. Did you also know that the toy industry gets involved in Disney films before the beginning of the film's production? agent_2:I don't know about it please explain the details agent_1:They prepare to make toys before the movie has even began filming. I was wondering how toys came out so quickly to promote a movie.  agent_2:I also think about it. agent_1:Also, apparently in the 70's Disney recycled a lot of animation frames so there are identical scenes in some movies. I am going to have to look out for those.  agent_2:okay,do you like dog? agent_1:I do like dogs. I also like cats. I like all animals really ha ha.  agent_2:Do you have them at home? agent_1:I have cats. I had dogs growing up but we have a lot of stray cats around my home and we took a couple in so now we are out of pet space.  agent_2:okay,how do you feel about hockey? agent_1:I don't mind hockey. I do know that Canada is the only country in the world with two national sports and they are hockey and lacrosse.  agent_2:i like hockey,The referee supervises the game, calls the penalties, determines if goals are scored and handles faceoffs at center ice at the start of each period. agent_1:It is very action oriented. It certainly moves quickly. Did you know that if they switch between a hockey rink and a basketball court that the hockey rink remains under the basketball court? I thought they completely swapped them out. 	agent_2:sorry i don't know about it	agent_1 likes TV show. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV show', 'movies', 'movie genre'].

I want to know so much more and be better but alas, I cannot. agent_2:Yes, Its very exciting on all the new stuff that will be coming out!! agent_1:I was surprised to find out that women own more iphones than men. agent_2:Really, I didn't know that! That surprises me, I thought it would be about equal. Iphone's have 75 elements in them. agent_1:75??? Huh... I feel like iphones are older than 12 years. They came out in 2007? agent_2:I did too. Did you know Apple's app store has 2.2 million applications available? agent_1:That's a ton! I wonder how many are actually active as in kept up or updated? How much egg does Microsoft have on it's face for holding a funeral for the iphone?	agent_2:lol, yes, That was since January 2017.

I don't remember this ""monster"" thing.  I think I'm reading the exploits of a snowflake millennial.  agent_2:Mine are gen Z, (early 2000), so I don't have any experience with the 90's millennials. Did you know Apple had a clothing line in the 90's? agent_1:Yes I did.  If this parent need a box of wine for 10  year olds, he/she is in for a big surprise.  agent_2:Meh, it's a blog. They tend to exaggerate for social media. I would love to go to the unclaimed luggage store in Alabama. Maybe I could find mine from several years ago. agent_1:Yeah but I don't like it when people make it look like kids are a huge problem even if it's for their own attention.  Yeah, I probably have luggage somewhere in ATL.  agent_2:If anything, all that does is show your lack of parenting skills...and alcohol problem. agent_1:Yeah, like that's a good solution -- getting lit. Funny, polo shirts should actually be called tennis shirts because a tennis player invented them. agent_2:I prefer the office attire of Hawaii. Suits and ties are too stifling in that heat. agent_1:Amen to that.  Or maybe a colorful wardrobe full of Pilgrim clothes?  The Pilgrims got a bad rap for always wearing black.  Not true... agent_2:I like the uniform at Billy Mays' funeral. Blue shirts and khaki pants were what the pallbearers were wearing. May as well be comfortable. agent_1:Yes, that's cool.  It's going to be OK to wear flip-flops at mine.  I'm a noted tie-hater... agent_2:Are you familiar with the theory that the universe is one giant hologram?"	agent_1:Yes, I'm an engineer that wishes he was and astrophysicist.

The one I mentioned can haul 30 pounds and may be used to work in dangerous environments like nuclear clean up. agent_2:That would be great! It sounds like Spot Mini that is 66 pounds and 2 feet 9 inches tall. agent_1:Wow.  I heard it can also move on surfaces that wheeled robots cant. agent_2:It sounds useful. I've also heard it can haul a 30 pound payload. agent_1:Yes.  Did you know Michael Jackson planned to build a 50 foot robot to roam around the desert near Las Vegas? agent_2:No, I did not! agent_1:Yeah and robots can be controlled by rat brains?  It will change personalities with the change of brains.  Wowl agent_2:Wow! I know robot movement is so precise that they can debone a chicken with surgical precision. agent_1:That precise yet the military uses Xbox controllers to disarm and ID IEDs.   agent_2:Really? Wow! I wonder if they learned that skill on Youtube? Especially since users can upload, share, view and rate videos. agent_1:Probably... Why not?  Police have ""BluTube"" to share videos.

I bet that is why they call them man's best friend.  agent_2:I guess so. They perform so many roles for humans, like hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, and companionship. I guess there's a reason why they are called that. They do a lot for humans. agent_1:Yeah. Apparently there are 12 different types of blood that a dog may have.  agent_2:I didn't know that. I wonder if they get good prizes at blood drives? agent_1:LOL, good question. Google prefers dogs to cats, did you know that?  agent_2:I did not know that. Did you know that Istanbul has vending machines with food and water for stray dogs in exchange for recycled plastic bottles. I think that's such a neat idea.  agent_1:No, I've never been to turkey. Have you been?  agent_2:I have many years ago.  agent_1:Interesting. How was it? Did you know that dogs and elephants are the only animals that understand pointing?  agent_2:It was a beautiful place. I was stationed there for a few months so I didn't get to see too much. I didn't know that. I always thought that dogs were color blind, but they're not they just can't see as many different colors as humans.  agent_1:Yeah, that's what I've heard. The first cloned pet was a cat, did you know that?  agent_2:I didn't know that, would you call that a ""copy cat?"" haha"	agent_1:Hilarious, well there are more tigers living as pets in the US than living in the wild in Asia. 	agent_2 likes pets. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['pets', 'preference', 'Google'].
8732	agent_1:Do you have children? agent_2:No I do not, how about you? agent_1:I do and he seems to be hitting puberty. Moody tween all the time. agent_2:Ah I assume that is causing some difficultly. Is there anything in particular he is stubborn on?  agent_1:He is a great kid, until he plays Fortnite. Something about that game gets him all jacked up and he acts like a different kid. agent_2:There have been a lot of studies on video games and it's effect on children. The consensus always seems to be that they use it as an outlet.  agent_1:I think listening to the way the other people talk and act affects him. He's usually mild and polite, but when he plays with them, he gets very hyper and surly. I also think it's the change in hormones. agent_2:That could very well be the case. Hormones seem to do something to susceptibility, at least it was for me as a teen.  agent_1:He's also at the awkward, trying to figure out who he is, stage. It's fun to really watch his personality develop. agent_2:It's such a weird place to be in the world. They are starting to take on more adult responsibilities but at the same time are still kids in a lot of ways.  agent_1:Right! He is such a little kid about some things, but he's starting to look at girls differently and it's a weird situation to be in. He used to tell me everything, but not so much anymore. agent_2:Wanting to have some secrets its about right developmentally speaking. Just feeling out some small forms of independence.  agent_1:His voice has also started to change. He is taking after his father with a super low, bass filled voice. It's crazy to hear that low deep voice come out of a kid! I'm wondering what else we are going to be in store for as he changes? agent_2:Has he already been through the outgrowing every bit of clothing stage?  agent_1:He's growing like he's getting paid for it! Every weekend we are going through his clothes and getting rid of what is too small! Especially pants and long sleeve shirts, he has long legs and arms. agent_2:Ugh, that has got to be the worst. Even with standard clothing it's got to be expensive and then occasions come up where you need things like suits and you know odds are they are only going to wear it once.  agent_1:We are sticking with a lot of khaki pants and nice dress shirts. If he has to have a suit, we'll have to buy it a couple of days before the event, there's no other way to deal with it. agent_2:That is a really smart plan. Forget even trying to tailor it, it will never be worth the cost and time. agent_1:I agree totally, tailoring is not worth it at all. I've been lucky with consignments and things so far, but the more he grows and the older he gets, I can't do that as much anymore. I just hope that puberty won't be terribly long as far as the growing is concerned. agent_2:I know thrift store typically had a lot of nicer things for women but you're right the men's selections seems to be lacking.

Especially after a 108 year drought! agent_1:Totally! They were the first team to ever win back-to-back World Series, then nothing. agent_2:Yes I do love Wrigley field where they play - its within the city agent_1:Did you know they evidently didn't win for so long because they were ""cursed"" by a man named Billy because Wrigley Field security would let him stay there with his pet goat? agent_2:Yes - who takes a goat to a baseball game?  But 5 million people celebrated in the streets after they finally won! agent_1:I would have, too! For one of the oldest teams in the major league? What a day. agent_2:Yes.  The Cubs and Atlanta are the two oldest teams - founded the same year as the battle of little bighourn! agent_1:It's so weird to think that the Cubs is only one of the two baseball teams in Chicago. agent_2:Yes that is pretty funny.  They have always been unique - they have had pitchers with 4, 5, and 6 fingers! agent_1:That's pretty neat. Can you believe the Ottoman empire was still in existence when the Cubs first won the World Series? agent_2:Wow that was a long time ago!   They have appeared in 11 world series total - apparently they were a lot better a hundred years ago! agent_1:I love watching the World Series, though the Women's World Cup had higher ratings. agent_2:Yes the World Series is great fun to watch.  The Fall Classic is always exciting.  I am not sure if I like it better with the playoffs than how it used to be with just the best record which went. agent_1:Baseball is so popular in Japan, they are always surprised to hear it is America's National pasttime. agent_2:Yes.  I think its funny the reason that baseball managers wear a uniform is that they are actually allowed to play! agent_1:Wow! I wonder if the same is true for the Kickball managers, or soccer-baseball in Canada. agent_2:I never realized that there was a couple who scheduled all of the major league games every year - all the way up until 2005!"	agent_1:Wow, that's gotta be over 2400 games!	agent_2 likes video games. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['video games', 'sports', 'baseball'].

After filming the goonies steven spielberg flew the entire cast to hawaii and surprised director richard donner with a cookout. agent_2:Amazing!  Thats so nice. When steven spielberg rode jurassic park the ride on opening day he requested that he was let off before the 84 foot drop	agent_1:Too funny!

What baseball city you like? agent_2:I'm a Nationals fan. It seems like the Astros made a splashy move by not having to commit tens of millions of dollars in annual salary well into the next decade.  agent_1:I hear ya....do you think Gerrit Cole is worth all the effort to get him? agent_2:I'm not sure, probably not, but let's see. Did you know that the managers wear uniforms because they technically are allowed to play?  agent_1:I never new the managers could also play. Can't remember that happening in ages. I always sort of liked Justin Verlander when he was with the Tigers. The Indians always kicked his butt. agent_2:Yeah. The Nationals have Bryce Harper, he had a bad year last year, but he is still very highly paid.  agent_1:Very true. I was rooting for the Nationals last year, but man they hit the wall late in the baseball season. What happened? agent_2:It happens all the time. Crazy, they just can't close the deal.  agent_1:That sounds an awful like the Indians. I'm 61 years old and have never seen them in a World Series. I'm beginning to think I never will. agent_2:Crazy. Well, they were in the movie Major League.  agent_1:LOL....yep...and with Charlie Sheen playing for them in that. Sheesh.

It doesnt quite hold up to NWA's work or Dark side of the moon in terms of popularity, but I like it. agent_1:thats great..... i listen to their songs abut to be quiet frank i dont know them as you do........ agent_2:They are a little more obscure, kind of like Ricky Gervais, who was actually a pop singer in the 80's.  I had no clue about that. agent_1:best music was from the 80's.... all kinds...... wish we were born then. agent_2:Very true, a study from 2012 even proves music has become more similar in terms of musical construction since the 60's. agent_1:thats good news....... but nothing to beat a classic agent_2:Like We are the Champions being voted the catchiest pop song ever.  I cant think of a person who hasnt heard that one. agent_1:Queen i a legend like he used to mention...... lots of his songs are my energy boosters agent_2:Freddie is probably one of the most iconic singers of all time.

My brother is getting married though! so there's that! I am trying to find the right gift for them.  agent_2:Congratulations!  Have you considered wine for a gift?  I've heard that California chardonnays are very good for challenging perceptions of what wine should taste like. agent_1:My brother and I are not much of drinkers. I do know that wines can have more alcohol content than beer though. like average 14.3%? I feel like we can make an exception on drinking this occasion though.  agent_2:I think you can.  Some wines go good with food.  There is a wine, La Cabotte Colline Cotes-du-Rhone Blanc that goes good with seafood. agent_1:I have heard of white wine pairing good with seafood, but honestly I'm not sure what food they're going to have. I think maybe pasta or steak? agent_2:That sounds good.  I've heard that red wines go good with beef.  I think there is a wine out of Tierra de Castilla, Spain that is said to be a good partner for meat and pasta dishes. agent_1:I might just go with that option. I've always thought of wine to be high-end and expensive but at $18 a bottle its pretty reasonable. 	agent_2:I think it definitely is reasonable and with so many wines out there nowadays price is probably no longer an issue.

Did you know that until 1978, a tennis player could use any object as a racket? agent_1:Nice!  I wonder if anyone ever tried to use something wacky?  A black man won the 1st US open tennis title in 1968 and no black man has won it since. agent_2:Wow! Not since 1968?

Did you know that she speaks fluent French and Italian, as does her sister Venus! agent_2:She is truly fascinating! She does it all! She is the first tennis player, male or female, to achieve the career Golden Slam in both singles and doubles. That means she won at least one Australian Open title, French Open title, Wimbledon title, US Open title, and Olympic Gold medal. agent_1:That's pretty incredible!  They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US Open. agent_2:That's a little before Serena's time! Although, did you know she went pro in tennis at the age of 13?! I could barely even get a ball over the net when I was 13! agent_1:lol  I do remember that.  Both her and her sister brought alot of good publicity to the sport. agent_2:That is for sure! Two girls from Compton came and conquered! In total, Serena has been Number 1 for 319 weeks!  agent_1:That is incredible!  The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days.  Wow! agent_2:Are you kidding me! Three days?! That's a long time! I don't have that kind of patience! Speaking of long records... did you know the longest point in pro tennis history was a 643 shot rally?  agent_1:Wow!  That would have been fun to watch...not so fun for the players. lol agent_2:Yeah! It lasted 29 minutes! I bet it was pretty exhilarating, but also probably pretty exhausting! I would certainly be out of breath after 29 minutes! agent_1:lol me too.  Are you a fan of rap music? agent_2:Oh yeah! Tennis reminds me a little of rap, since they're both so fast paced. Did you know the world's fastest rapper can rap at a rate of 14.1 syllables per second? agent_1:Holy smokes I wouldn't be able to listen that fast!  lol  It's been fun chatting with you! agent_2:Then maybe you could try the deaf rapper, Signmark.

I'm on the fence, but I've heard that astronomers have some evidence of life 455 light-years away. agent_2:Yes,  I think so.  Its just weird that out of all those planets and space and galaxies that we are the only planet with life.  agent_1:I agree. Sometimes I just look at the moon at night and think about how small we all are compared to what else is out there! agent_2:I know right,  just thinking about space and everything out there is very humbling.

THe Javanese alphabet too, if recited in order it forms a poem agent_2:the vikings were warrior poets. lol what the heck? did they just shout poetry at the enemy ? agent_1:Hahaha maybe that is how they fought.

Tennis is fun too. a black man won the us open in 1968 and no other black man has since then. That would be award worthy agent_2:Yes they should make a movie about him! it's interesting to that until 1978 you could use any object as a tennis racket, that sounds dangerous agent_1:That would be hilarious to see what some  people came up with. What would  you use? lol agent_2:I would use a rocket launcher LOL just kidding. do you watch soccer at all? Apparently soccer makes more than all other sports combined agent_1:Lol that would be perfect, no opponent means you  win everytime!  agent_2:That's a great point! Did you know that table tennis is the name of the actual sport, and that ping pong is only the name of the company that sells the table tennis equipment? agent_1:I did not know that, wow! Mind blown! Back to soccer, did you have a favorite team in the world cup? agent_2:No I don't. I really don't like soccer I think it's boring LOL it's weird to me that the Super Bowl is smaller than soccer's biggest events agent_1:it is boring, but it is kind of fun to watch one week per 4 years lol. I liked Brazil agent_2:Well soccer is a good exercise though, apparently a player will run about 7 miles per game, that's good for burning calories agent_1:so good, they always have tight bodies lol. There was a german soccer player who donated 300000 euros to help pay for surgeries in brazil	agent_2:That's really nice of him! What a nice guy, why do you think Greenland can't join FIFA?

8502	agent_1:hi how are you? do you like baseball? agent_2:Hi, I think it is fun to learn about. I don't understand why the managers can also be players. That is sort of odd. agent_1:that must date back to the day when one of the players was chosen to manage as well. like an onfield boss or leader. agent_2:Oh okay, that makes more sense for sure. The rules can be outdated sometimes, I think. I remember a story about a man who found old baseball cards in his grandpas attic. Being outdated is a good thing then. agent_1:yes, those old cards would be worth a lot to someone. i would sell some of them and keep the rest as an investment. agent_2:Yes, the man found out that they were worth 3 million dollars, in fact. agent_1:that is wonderful chunk of change! more that you could make just by chatting online with someone, i think LOL Would you sell the cards? agent_2:Yeah, I think I would too. As soon as I hired a police escort to the bank. Baseball is so popular in Japan, did you know that? agent_1:yes, i have been to games there. the fans are different, but just as enthusiastic. i recommend going. agent_2:Oh, neat what a fun experience. Yeah I learned that the fans in Japan just can't believe that Americans consider it a passtime. agent_1:yes, they are not aware of how big stuff outside of Japan is. they think that 7-11 started in Japan. strange. but now many japanese players are in the MLB> agent_2:Oh wow, what a trip. I think its neat how pro athletes give things and money to causes. For instance some NFL player leave their shoes on the field n order to bring awareness to homelessness. agent_1:yes, that is a great way to raise awareness. i wish more athletes did things like that.  agent_2:Me too, it make a real difference. I am a big fan of Target too, lol. I guess just because they price match and I like to shop. agent_1:i havent gone there much. it looks like a clean, safe walmart. i guess it is good that they price match. agent_2:Yeah, they have all sorts of thing but havent sold tobacco since 1996. agent_1:yeah, i thought that was strange. there is money in cigs, and people buy them. i guess they felt it was a bad way to make money. agent_2:Yeah, I agree to let people buy and sell what they want to we are free here, its nice. I think they sell ballet shoes there too and I know my daughter goes through 4 pairs a week as a professional ballet dancer. agent_1:I would probably go through 10 pairs. I would not be any good as a ballerina. Anyway, great chat!	agent_2:HA, yeah me too.. I need to find some slippers at Target.

594	agent_1:did you watch the movie Frozen? agent_2:I did and loved it so much, and you? agent_1:me too. Did you know it is the first movie by disney directed by a woman? agent_2:Yes and also that it made $1 billion worklwide, that is amazing agent_1:I know. Elsa was the main villain in the original script of the movie agent_2:Yes but the let it go song was too uplifting to keep her as the villain agent_1:Yes. And the original title of the movie was the Snow Queen agent_2:Yes but they changed it because feminine titles do not seem to do well, so sad agent_1:That is sad and it is just the mentality that we have to work hard to change agent_2:Yup agreed. They also changed Rapunzel to Tangled for that same reason agent_1:Yeah. DO you have a pet? agent_2:I have two cats and a dog. DO you like dogs? agent_1:I love dogs. did you there they can have one of the 12 blood types? agent_2:Yes and there are blood drives for dogs agent_1:So cool. In istanbul they have installed water and food dispensers for dogs agent_2:Yes and all you have to do is feed it plastic bottles agent_1:Yes such a genius idea and it helps everyone involved agent_2:I know.

10022	agent_1:Did you watch the Pacific Rim Uprising movie? agent_2:Hello there, no I have not see it, is it any good? agent_1:I did, I thought it was pretty good, the first movie was better though, had more action agent_2:I will have to check it out sometime then if I get a chance.   Are you a big user of Netflix? agent_1:I am a big user, I have an account and use it almost every day, mostly after 9pm, what about you? agent_2:No I don't have an account currently.  So you are one of those that make up using all that bandwidth during peak hours lol.  agent_1:I am a part of that group, yes, lol, its also YouTubes fault as they together with netflix they take upon half of the internet traffic agent_2:Yeah I can totally see that, YouTube is so popular among younger people it's crazy to me.  agent_1:It is really popular, just like Netflix is, its amazing how the service has 137 million subscribers around the globe agent_2:And that number is still growing, thats so many.  But, it is quality stuff, you get access to an insane amount of content.  agent_1:I agree, you get more than what you pay for, I used to spend a lot of money on rentals and those late fees were a real pain to pay agent_2:Yeah I think that is why Hastings started the company in the first place, he was in your same shoes.  agent_1:Could be, so he must hate Star Wars then, do you like the franchise? agent_2:Yeah I grew up watching the movies years ago when I was a kid, I still think the ones from the late 70's/early 80's are the best ones.  How about you? agent_1:I do too, I think old movies are the best ones, I love Star Wars personally, I dont like the new movies as much though,  agent_2:Yeah I'm the same way when it comes to that.  It is hard to replicate, and I know the Star Wars fans are so hardcore and hard to please as well! agent_1:Yeah I agree with you, its amazing how much the franchise is worth though, 65 billion dollars!! agent_2:Yeah that is an insane amount.  I wonder how much it was worth back in the 1990's? agent_1:I bet not much, at least at the beggining 20th Century Fox didnt have much faith in the movie, that lack of faith cost them millions agent_2:Yeah they dropped the ball, Disney sure spent a bunch but i'm sure it will all pay off in the long run.  agent_1:They need to improve the movies, have more jedis in them, do you like Transformers?	agent_2:Yeah I agree with that for sure.

4802	agent_1:How familiar are you with the hunting and gathering culture people used to have? agent_2:Not too familiar,      Although I've read a bit from researcher Nicole Kruspe discussing odor. agent_1:Although our sense of smell may not be as developed as some species, odor played an essential role in our survival. However, odor is unique in that people don't name the specific odor itself, but rather what it reminds us of. agent_2:Interesting.   Western scholars dismissed scents as unknowable, or at least unnameable for millenia. agent_1:True, but recent studies by Majid found that the Jahai, who are hunter gatherers still, are able to identify these odors by abstract names. It seems that these hunter gathers & horticulturalists can identify odors, unlike the rest of their world due to their unique cirucmstances. agent_2:True, Kruspe and Majid propose that, when people settle into, say, horticulture or postindustrial society, other senses become relatively more important than smell. 	agent_1:McGann states that this ability to distinguish the differences in odor receptors would play a greater role in a more natural, wild environment than the secure urban areas that most horicultural people live. While distinquishing complex smells may save a hunter/gather's life in the wild, it would be as much a life or death situation in most instances in an urban setting. In fact, simple odors like smelling sulfur are enough for most people to avoid dangerous situations.	agent_2 dislikes smell. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['smell', 'hobby', 'other senses'].
5101	agent_1:I'm not really into sports, but I learned a lot about baseball. agent_2:Hello, me too, but have you heard about Philadelphia Phillies? agent_1:I know a little about them. They have a funny mascot. It looks like Stephen Strasburg is doing well since healing from his injury. agent_2:you know that ended in a 5-1 win for Strasburg and the Washington Nationals at Citizens Bank Park and gave the team its first five-game winning streak since the end of May. I was so surprised, can you imagine 5:1... agent_1:That's amazing. I can't believe the Nationals have a 19 year old rookie player who is doing so well. agent_2:yes that is amazing. He fell behind a couple times and got right back to throwing strikes. He did really, really well. Do you know Aaron Nola? agent_1:I have never heard of him. Is he a good player too? agent_2:Yes hi is. he Phillies' Aaron Nola has been one of the National League's best and is right behind Max Scherzer and the New York Mets' Jacob deGrom in the Cy Young conversation, that's the information I have learned agent_1:That's something. I thought it was interesting that all othe game scheduling was done through a married couple until 2005. I wonder who handles it now.  agent_2:yes me either. Then it was a nerve impingement in his neck. Now Strasburg is inching back into form, one start at a time, even if most of his fastballs are still registering in the low 90s.  agent_1:The low 90s is pretty fast for someone with that kind of injury. I also didn't know the game was so popular in Japan.	agent_2:Me too, can you believe, in Japan...  I also learned that Ryan Zimmerman added a run-scoring single three hitters later and a solo home run in the fourth that sneaked just above Odubel Herrera's glove and into the bushes beyond the center field wall.	agent_1 likes sports. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'baseball', '19 year old rookie'].
11031	agent_1:Hello.  Did you vote in the mid term election? agent_2:Hi yes I did. How about you? agent_1:I did. I think it is very important for all of us to vote. agent_2:It is important. I also like trivia about politics. Did you know that the senate used the same gavel for 165 years until Richard Nixon cracked it? agent_1:I heard about it.  Why did Nixon crack the gavel? He was not supposed to use it. agent_2:I doubt that he did it on purpose. He probably just got carried away. But I'll bet he felt pretty bad. agent_1:I said earlier that voting is important.  In India, they went even further.  They set up a polling booth in a forest full of lions just to give one person the opportunity to vote. agent_2:I don't think we would go that far do you? agent_1:No, I do not think so.  Did you hear about the senate and their candy drawer?   agent_2:Yeah, it must be nice. But I guess you have to give some of them free candy just to show up. Look at the Senator they had to drag in by his feet in 1988.	agent_1:Yes, I heard the obscure rule that was invoked by a US senator.

8134	agent_1:Hi, how are you? Do you like jazz? agent_2:Hi there! Yeah I do like jazz! Do you? agent_1:Yes, I love jazz. I am listening to some right now.  agent_2:Ah nice! Yeah Jazz is interesting to me simply because it originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans. It's definitely rare and unique, in my opinion.  agent_1:It certainly is. I think that it should be more popular, but it is too artistic. Not enough show business, too much art. agent_2:Can you believe that Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts? Wow jazz has made it's way from New Orleans around the entire world! agent_1:Yes, even in Pakistan. I figure that there is value in all genres of music. Perhaps the rest of the world sees the value in jazz. agent_2:There certainly is value in all music, I agree! Which reminds me that I just recently heard that Clint Eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast, pianist, and he's scored several films, including Million Dollar Baby! agent_1:He seems like a tough guy, but he is an actor and artist so I'm not surprised. He is not a very good singer though. agent_2:Haha, then maybe I should be happy I've not heard him sing! So I was reading about how jazz trumpeters grew goatees to make playing a bit more comfortable. I wonder if that is possibly the origin of goatees. Maybe, maybe not! agent_1:He sang at the end of Gran Turino. I think people tried all kinds of facial hair, but for brass, maybe it's an obvious choice. agent_2:Hm. I did watch that movie but I just can't remember him singing! I'll check it out again, since now I'm pretty curious! :) agent_1:Right at the end. Then another singer takes over. Clint writes good melodies though.  agent_2:Interesting to be able to write melodies but not be able to sing so well! I pretty much have the opposite problem. Haha. Clint seems like such a new-age cowboy to me. Speaking of cowboys! The most popular hat in the old west was the bowler hat and not even the cowboy hat! agent_1:I guess the bowler was style and class and the cowboy hat was a working hat.  agent_2:Personally I prefer cowboy hats, especially since it's associated with hard work, instead of just sophistication and such. :)  agent_1:Yes, they have their own kind of cool. the bowler looks stuffy. agent_2:I agree! I prefer hates for functionality such as protecting against weather conditions, sun, and even beanie's for cold weather! Beanies are technically hats, right? agent_1:Yes, sure. But dont wear one to a wedding though! anyway, great chat! agent_2:Yeah thanks!

It looks like amazon means exciting news. They are now looking for a site for a second headquarters! agent_1:That's great! Not everyone thinks so though, Amazon can come with difficulties in transportation and shoot up the housing costs of whatever city it's in.  agent_2:They do make an impact wherever they go. I found interesting that there is a building named after the first amazon.com customer agent_1:I heard they're considering Washington as a place for their 2nd HQ, wherever they put the building is going to get a huge boost! I heard they're even considering New York! agent_2:Also Los angeles, atlanta, and Dallas. they are looking for as much as 8 million sq ft agent_1:Don't forget about their original HQ, it was founded by Jeff Bexos on July 5 1994. And it's the largest internet retailer in the world!  agent_2:An in the US they are the most valuable company after Apple and Microsoft, they have really grow so much!	agent_1:It's probably thanks to their hard-workers!

4221	agent_1:How are you today. agent_2:Well thank you. Do you have any hobbies? agent_1:Funny you mention it i use to write a little poetry. how about you? agent_2:I used to do a little poetry in high school, learning about allusions, symbolism, and all the other poetry jargon.  agent_1:Wow that's taking me back. Poetry dates back to prehistoric times. agent_2:Poetry was first written by the Greeks I believe. Perhaps earlier, but I don't think we have any other ancient written works dating prior agent_1:The earliest western poetry was written in Sumerian.  agent_2:Was it as complex then as today? Using rhyme, rhetoric, and other literary devices? agent_1:One was called the Epic of Sundiata an example of griot court poetry. This was in Africa.  agent_2:Writing poetry is definitely an art. For instance, there is poem that when read normally is depressing, yet backwards it is inspiring. Perhaps embodying the silver lining to a negative situation. agent_1:Wow i would like to read that one. There is an alphabet that when recited in order forms a poem. I for get which one. agent_2:To this day poetry influenced our perceptions. For instance, all the hobbit's character names are derived from the poem dvergatal agent_1:Now that i did not know. Do you like dogs? agent_2:Who doesn't? I think that humans can bond with most animals, even crocs, but the level of intimacy is different from that of dogs since dogs and humans have evolved side by side to be better attuned to one another agent_1:I agree for instance did you know that dogs have 12 different blood types and they donate blood? agent_2:I did. I was surprised I never thought about animals donating bird before I learned that fact agent_1:Apparently google prefers dogs to cats. agent_2:Then I wonder if employees can bring their dogs to work every day? agent_1:Apparently they've even written it into their code of conduct. agent_2:Well I guess Google simply acknowledges that dogs are man's best friend agent_1:I always believed that dogs were color blind but that's not entirely true. 	agent_2:I think they can only see less colors like blue and yellow	agent_1 likes movie. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'hobbit', 'work'].

How about you? agent_2:Yeah I am the same way, I haven't been for a few years but used to go all the time.  What would you say is your favorite ever? agent_1:I would have to say Pink Floyd, or Linkin Park, there is so many!  agent_2:That is awesome, I am a big Pink Floyd fan, well I kinda am, of their first album.  But any concert that they ever played would be really cool to attend.  agent_1:Yes, they have the best shows that I have seen. Aerosmith puts on a great concert too. agent_2:That sounds good as well.  I really like the Apples in Stereo, they put on a good show.  Radiohead was really good as well, although I really went to see the opening band, thats sad but true.  agent_1:I love Radihead, who was the opening band at that concert? agent_2:Yeah they are awesome, and I wasn't aware of how little they toured!  But I really wanted to see Steve Malkmus and the Jicks.  agent_1:Oh wow, I haven't heard of them. I hope you enjoyed that concert though!  agent_2:Yeah it was really good, I was in high school, I remember my friend and I went together, it was awesome. Alpine Valley in Wisconsin.  agent_1:Cool! I have enjoyed every concert I have ever been to. I heard that there was a lawsuit against the band Creed for the show being so bad lol....I wonder how that worked out. agent_2:Yeah that is so lame to me.  If you don't like it, then you learn your lesson and don't buy any more tickets to any more concerts. 	agent_1:Exactly! So do you ever go vote in the elections at all?

Google really is taking over the world. Their data center electricity use is 0.01 percent of all worldwide electricity. agent_1:Yes for sure they are. they have grown so much over the years agent_2:But I like that they like to have fun too. Have you ever typed askew into Google? agent_1:No I have. What does the results turn? agent_2:You should try it! It tilts the page. Another fun thing Google does is call new employees nogglers. They have to wear propeller beanies. Or is this mean? agent_1:Oh, not sure about that really. People say it is a great place to work at though agent_2:Before Google launched gmail, that was the name of a free email service offered by garfield's website. That actually seems more fun. agent_1:I know now everytime I open gmail I think of garfield agent_2:Speaking of cats, I would love to get a glow in the dark one. They have those in South Korea. agent_1:Wow. In Japana and Taiwan there are cat cafes where you can play with them agent_2:That seems fun! That reminds me of the Anderson house bed and breakfast in Minnesota. They used to offer a free cat for the night when you booked a room. agent_1:wow. there is a town in alaska where the mayor of the town is a cat	agent_2:That is cool. Cats are a pretty smart species.

I wonder if one has actually ever played? agent_1:The only one I can think if is Pete Rose who regularly played as manager. Do you have a favorite team? agent_2:My favorite team is the Atlanta Braves, from the days of Chipper Jones.  What's your favorite team? agent_1:Mine is the Dodgers. I have to admire that team that Atlanta had, their pitching staff was something else. agent_2:I hear in Japan, baseball is so popular that some Japanese people are shocked to find out that its America's national pastime.	agent_1:So I've heard.

Those are the best. agent_2:It is amazing how star wars was created long time ago , in 1977 and with a movie made last year , the star wars fever is so alive! agent_1:It has to be one of the most sucessful franchises ever.  40 years and still has a great following. agent_2:It is incredible that the first eight films were nominated for academy awards, they were able to  create wonderful productions! agent_1:The total value of the franchise was about $65 billion.  It will definitely always be a legend! agent_2:And 20 century fox though star wars was going to be a failure!! agent_1:I heard that, apparently so did Harrison Ford, I heard he didnt want to be credited in the film initially. agent_2:Is that right! Well, good for George Lucas because this poor vision from 20 century made him a billionaire agent_1:It definitely did.  Do you know how much James Earl Jones was paid to record Darth Vader's lines? agent_2:I believe it was $7,500, and he just spent 2 hours and a half doing so agent_1:Isnt that crazy?  Some of those lines are so iconic, and he got so little for them.  Shame. agent_2:I agree, it is basically nothing.. Did you know George Luca's wife influenced the star wars movies a lot? agent_1:Yeah, didnt she receive an editing award too? agent_2:She got an award for editing!! I think she made an important contribution.. good job agent_1:She definitely changed some parts significantly.  It would have been far different without her. agent_2:Yes, she did major changes.. and is interesting George did not get the award for directing! agent_1:Eminem has more oscars than George Lucas!  That is hard to believe! agent_2:Wow, and he has won more awards than Leo Di Caprio, Johnny Depp and Bill murray combined agent_1:I didnt realized he had any at all, I wonder what they were all for. agent_2:Have to check!! Do you know who has won , best actor 3 times? agent_1:Who?  Harrison Ford? agent_2:It is Daniel Day Lewis, what an accomplishment agent_1:It really is!

11334	agent_1:Hello, my good friend! How are you doing today on this fine fine day? agent_2:Hi very good thanks. It is interesting learning about the Republican party back in the 1800's! agent_1:The Republican party has deep roots, it has a long history, but it has changed. Now we are down to just two parties. It is not good. agent_2:Yeah I agree. Since 1853 there has been no president other than republican or democrats. agent_1:I think that the red/blue division has made politics unsatisfying for many voters. They want other options but there are none. agent_2:True. That whole categorization didn't start until 2000 surprisingly. agent_1:I think that the polarization of politics came with the Bush/Gore election. I am not happy that it has not changed. Now we need for independents.  agent_2:Yes I agree with you there. Interestingly every president with a beard has been a republican! agent_1:I think that the beard conveys wisdom, the deep wisdom that comes from age. I think that the republicans want to look like Lincoln. agent_2:Yes good point. In the pas they used animals to associate with parties. Truman took that very seriously. agent_1:I think that Truman knew that the elephant was his mortal enemy and could not be trusted. Even at Disneyland. He knew the impact of media. agent_2:True. He just didn't want to be associated with Republicans! agent_1:I think that he was smart. The Republicans were probably trying to set him up. They laid a cunning trap, but he was too smart for those  agent_2:Yeah Truman was a smart guy like you say. After the Voting Rights Act in 1965 the southern states became more reupublican. agent_1:Yes, the voting issue made many people in the South angry. They did not want the change so they went to the other party, the one with the beards.	agent_2:Haha the beard party yes.

I'm going to look up bowler hat agent_1:The bowler hats were extremely popular in the old west. agent_2:I looked at a picture of bowler hat. I think I like cowboy hat better. Or those Mexican hats. Those are cool agent_1:They do look very similar to the cowboy hats, no wonder they were so popular. agent_2:They are cute but maybe that's why I don't like them.

I tip my hat to greet people when I'm wearing one. agent_2:I don't like to wear a hat unless it's to keep the sun out of my face agent_1:Are you afraid of snakes? agent_2:No, I think they are kind of cool.

I don't know how to play it, but I think that it works well in many kinds of music. agent_1:There is an aluminum grand piano that weight 356 pounds, Im guessing thats pretty light for a piano like that one agent_2:True. That was the one on the Hindenburg. Probably sounded pretty tinny. Aluminum. Hm. agent_1:Probably yeah, theres another cool fact about a piano, a group of climbers find one in the strangest of places agent_2:I wonder why someone put a piano up there. Did they play it? Did they want others to play it? How did they put it there? agent_1:I have no idea how it got there, that is a big mystery can you imagine reaching the top and theres a piano right there agent_2:A mystery, like the  mysterious mute man  found wandering the streets in England in 2005 and could only communicate via piano agent_1:I didnt hear about that mute man, sounds like an interesting anecdote agent_2:Almost as strange as Richard Nixon's piano concerto, which he wrote and performed it live on the Tonight Show agent_1:He did? I dint know he played the piano what other instruments do you like maybe the guitar? agent_2:The guitar is totally rad man. I dig it. Since its debut in 1949, the Les Paul Gibson es-175 guitar has never gone out of production. agent_1:I like Eddie Van Halen I heard the studio got on fire with one of his solos, so much power in that guitar agent_2:He really can shred. Setting the amp on fire! Great! Brian May of Queen built his guitar out of parts from an old fireplace and his mother's knitting needle.  agent_1:How the level of skill and the determination to become a guitarist, he also has a PHD in astrophysics, really intelligent man agent_2:True. Cornell university researchers built the world's smallest guitar,played by a laser, about the size of a red blood cell. I bet Brian May could figure out a way to play that guitar. agent_1:I bet he can he can put that PHD in astrophysics and his mad skills as a guitarist to work I think his one of the greatest of all time agent_2:The bio-pic of Freddie Mercury did well at the Oscars. Rami Malek won Best Actor. I guess Queen is finally getting recognized by Hollywood. agent_1:He won the Oscar right, I thought he nailed it, he was great on that movie, that movie made me cry agent_2:Great guitar and piano playing too.

The piano is being playing using a keyboard that has a row of keys that the pianist presses down to cause the hammers to strike the strings. agent_1:That is one interesting fact! You know what is more interesting though, how computers have come about! agent_2:I agree. Computers are more complex than pianos in my opinion because they are devices that carry sequences by computer programming. agent_1:Well said! I wish I could have used a computer that used water to run it like the Russians did! agent_2:Really!! I didn't know that the Russians did this. Do you know who wrote the first computer algorithm? agent_1:No I don't! Who was it? agent_2:It was by a woman named Ada Lovelace. agent_1:Oh cool!

As for the babies dancing spontaneously when they hear music, I totally agree. My child does the same agent_2:Mine do as well.  Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week. agent_1:That I certainly didn't know.

But this is interesting too..even though he did almost none of the work, when spartacus got the academy award for best cinematography, it went to the credited cinematographer, and not kubrick. agent_2:Probably, some kind of union thing, like he was not an official cinematographer.  I wonder if they gave him something for it.  agent_1:Thats a good question! No woman has ever been nominated for the academy award for best cinematography. agent_2:I guess it is because there is not many female cinematographer because they would not hire them.

The consensus always seems to be that they use it as an outlet.  agent_1:I think listening to the way the other people talk and act affects him. He's usually mild and polite, but when he plays with them, he gets very hyper and surly. I also think it's the change in hormones. agent_2:That could very well be the case. Hormones seem to do something to susceptibility, at least it was for me as a teen. 	agent_1:He's also at the awkward, trying to figure out who he is, stage. It's fun to really watch his personality develop.	agent_2 likes TV. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV', 'family', 'family member'].

It sounds fascinating though. I read more classics like the Iliad.  agent_2:Yes I read that too. They're very interesting I think. We should put more effort to read those kinds of books in our school system agent_1:I totally agree. Poetry and its word choices and writing structure makes it something that encourages creativity.  agent_2:Yes and the interesting thing about the word poetry is that it drives from a Greek term, the term is poesis which means making agent_1:That makes sense since when it comes to poetry you are definitely making something. I don't think it is as appreciated as a writing form as it could be.  agent_2:Yes I agree. No one really writes poetry anymore. It's interesting how in Javanese, the alphabet will form a phone when it is read in order agent_1:Oh that's really neat. I love when poems do cool things like that. Like the depressing poem that you are meant to read backwards so it becomes a happy one.  agent_2:Yes I'll have to check that out. It makes me sad that Edgar Allan Poe only got $9 for the poem ""The Raven"" that's actually a really amazing poem agent_1:You would think that his family estate is getting royalties on that. I bet the person that paid him so little was kicking themselves when he became popular.  agent_2:Yes I agree. Did you hear about the 224 palindrome poem? It was created by Demetri Martin, that sounds interesting agent_1:224! That is a huge amount of palindromes. I'm not even sure I can think of that many let alone that many sentences that could be palindromes. Talk about talent.  agent_2:Yes I agree! What do you think about the Sun by the way? It's amazing that the diameter is 109 times that of Earth's diameter that is so huge"	agent_1:That is really huge!

I can't imagine not having computers now since we have learned to depend on them so much.  agent_2:We sure do, I have an apple computer, I didnt know smoking near it would make my warranty void. agent_1:Really? I didn't know that. back in 1936 some russians actually made a computer that ran on water....how strange is that. agent_2:Really strange, I wonder what happened to that model? maybe water wasnt the best choice. 	agent_1:Right!

Did you know that Iceland had no public rail service?  agent_2:Yes, i did know that. Japan on the other hand has a tremendous rail service. if you plan to visit, the rail system is better than the highway. however the air travel in Iceland is probably cheaper. agent_1:Did you know that bird's bones are hollow?  agent_2:Yes, I did. they are stronger because they are hollow. lighter too. Did you know that birds have regional accents according to scientists? agent_1:No, I didn't know that. I also didn't know the feathers weight more than their bones.  agent_2:I guess that is also true of crows, which are among the most intelligent of birds, and are even capable of imitating human speech. agent_1:Interesting. What do you know about machine learning?  agent_2:It is learning done by machines. Beyond that, not much. You? agent_1:They have an algo that can mine rap lyrics and write their own.  agent_2:That is very cool. Soon we will not need rap artists. We can have the machines do it for us. agent_1:Hilarious.

That's a lot of shows in one year! agent_1:Yes it is. I don't like them though. I'm more of a country person. agent_2:Country is good too!  I was never much of a Ramones fan but they toured almost non stop for 20 years playing a total of 2,263 concerts.  That's a crazy high number of shows. agent_1:Definitely! I've never heard of them though. Did you know that Creed was sued in 2002 because their concert was so bad? agent_2:I didn't know that!  They must have been really really bad. lol  There's an old ancient Roman amphitheatre in Croatia that's still used as a concert venue.  That would be neat to see. agent_1:Yes it would. Do you play piano. I love it but can't play it. agent_2:I like it and tried several times when I was younger but couldn't get the hang of it. In 1930 there was no news worth reporting so the BBC decided to just play piano music instead. agent_1:That is something. I am astonished that someone managed to get a piano on top of Britain's highest mountain lol. agent_2:Wow.  Wondered how in the heck they did that?  I couldn't even imagine taking on that task.  Both Freddie Mercury and Paul McCartney used the same piano to record their hits ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and ""Hey Jude"".  That's kind of neat. agent_1:Yes it is. I love both those songs. I love Paul McCartney on the piano. He can make those keys sing I think. Imagine putting an aluminum grand piano on an airship and it weighing only 356 pounds. Wow! agent_2:That's neat that it was made out aluminum!  I wonder if it was on the Hindenburg when it crashed? agent_1:That's probable. I don't know a lot about the violin but there are definitely a lot of variations of it. agent_2:Yes.  It country music they call it a fiddle! agent_1:Yes. That's about the only thing I don't like in Country music lol. The music from them just hits me the wrong way. agent_2:It does give it a distinctive sound though.  lol  There is violin that is made out of stone that is playable. agent_1:Wow! makes you wonder how thats possible. I'm very surprised that Einstein played both the violin and piano. I never knew that."	agent_2:He was a genius.

I remember watching the HBO special of his Madison Square Garden show.  Are you a fan? agent_1:No, I'm not.  I don't dislike him however... I guess people aren't quite buying his re-branding.  One said, ""all the flannel in the world couldn't warm critical reception to the tour."" agent_2:Haha, that is a great line.  I think he became a lot more personable after marrying Jessica Biel.  He has definitely come a long way from Nipplegate. agent_1:Ha.  He seems to be more effect.  Many think he should stick to his hits and not try to change too much.  agent_2:I have heard some call his new tour empty, but that ""many people enjoy empty fun.""  Sounds poignant, but also a shot at society! agent_1:I think the detractors mainly don't like the theme and think he should do shows as he has always done. agent_2:Yes, people love the old stuff in general.  One of the best-selling albums of 2014 was Dark Side of the Moon.  Over 40 years after being initially released! agent_1:Yes, it's a classic.  Pink Floyd is different.  They turned a houseboat into a floating recording studio on the river Thames."	agent_2:Haha, yup they are awesome.  I was a being fan of Linkin Park.

She makes almost as much as Lebron. agent_2:thats nuts! yup the second highest paid celebrity, I wonder how much Robin Williams made for doing the genie in aladdin agent_1:Im not sure, but surely a heck of a lot, he was a famous celebrity by then. He was probably one of the few to be able to enter Pixar's studio secret room. agent_2:haha ya I agree, did you watch Sesame street as a kid? I never knew the first celebrity on the show was Carol Burnett agent_1:Interesting! well you know, celebrity status is often associated with wealth and PERKS!

Hence the name of the brand and crocodile shirt. agent_1:Interesting, Lacoste is a brand that I like a lot, do you know how long the longest game on tennis history lasted? agent_2:I do not, how long?  agent_1:it lasted over 3 days!!! thats a really long time agent_2:I bet Jon Isner was involved.

Speaking of libraries, there are more libraries than McDonalds in the United States. Do you have a library card? agent_1:I do and that is good to hear. Also, half of adult have library cards that seems like more than I would have thought. agent_2:I know. I don't know that a lot of my friends go to the library. The Sacramento Library has instituted a type of library that might make going to the library more interesting to many. They started a library of things, so you can check out sewing machines and other things that you don't need to own for a long time. agent_1:That would be so useful. I wonder if other cities do that? I know that normal library collections often included DVD's and CD's and other things besides books. agent_2:Yes, and I have also checked out passes to various museums in my city. I'm glad some people were dedicated to starting libraries in the past as they have been so useful to me. Have you heard of UK Prime Minister William Gladstone? agent_1:I have. I heard that he started a library in 1895 with 32,000 books in it. All from his personal collection. Can you imagine? agent_2:The more amazing thing to me is how he carted all those books by wheelbarrow over 3/4 mile. He was 85! agent_1:Maybe his daughter helped him. I wonder how many were Shakespeare plays. I was reading one at the library. Did you know that Shakespear coined many of the terms we use today, including ""good riddance"" and ""laughing stock?"" agent_2:Oh, that's interesting. I would never have thought as luck would have it, break the ice, and full circle were from Shakespeare. agent_1:I guess it makes sense that he coined so many terms since he was the world's greatest dramatist. Plus, he wrote so much. He wrote 39 plays! agent_2:Not only did he coin terms, but he created names. The names Miranda, Olivia and Jessica were invented by Shakespeare. I didn't know those names went so far back! agent_1:That is interesting. I wonder if these names sound different with the accent of the time. I know the accent can affect the meaning of the performance. The old accent can introduce rhymes or puns that don't work with our modern tongue. What might Miranda sound like in Shakespeare's voice? agent_2:That is an interesting thought. Shakespeare has been translated into every major language. I wonder how they preserve Shakespeare's style and language in other languages."	agent_1:That is a good question. It would be interesting to study that in school.

I love the soothing sound of it. years ago the bbc didn't have any news worth reporting so the just played piano music lol that's awesome. agent_2:That odd considering the news giant BBC is today! did you know that Freddy Mercury played the same piano as Paul McCartney agent_1:My thoughts exactly! Oh wow that's an interesting fact! They built a piano for the Hindenburg and it only weighed over 300 pounds, who would think of putting a piano on that airship! agent_2:That takes some useful weight out of the plane, and maybe someone that is a real piano fan, would be nice to listen to it in the sky though. agent_1:Very true. Piano music is great no matter where you are. It is like poetry to your ears, which I love too. I write some poetry and it's a great stress reliever :) agent_2:I do like poetry, do you like the series of Lord of the Rings? most of the hobbits names are actually names of poetry. agent_1:Oh wow I didn't realize that.

Poetry dates back to prehistoric times. agent_2:Poetry was first written by the Greeks I believe. Perhaps earlier, but I don't think we have any other ancient written works dating prior agent_1:The earliest western poetry was written in Sumerian.  agent_2:Was it as complex then as today? Using rhyme, rhetoric, and other literary devices? agent_1:One was called the Epic of Sundiata an example of griot court poetry. This was in Africa.  agent_2:Writing poetry is definitely an art. For instance, there is poem that when read normally is depressing, yet backwards it is inspiring. Perhaps embodying the silver lining to a negative situation. agent_1:Wow i would like to read that one. There is an alphabet that when recited in order forms a poem. I for get which one. agent_2:To this day poetry influenced our perceptions. For instance, all the hobbit's character names are derived from the poem dvergatal agent_1:Now that i did not know. Do you like dogs? agent_2:Who doesn't? I think that humans can bond with most animals, even crocs, but the level of intimacy is different from that of dogs since dogs and humans have evolved side by side to be better attuned to one another agent_1:I agree for instance did you know that dogs have 12 different blood types and they donate blood? agent_2:I did. I was surprised I never thought about animals donating bird before I learned that fact agent_1:Apparently google prefers dogs to cats.	agent_2:Then I wonder if employees can bring their dogs to work every day?	agent_1 likes pets. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['pets', 'hobby', 'poetry'].

When Google is down, almost all web traffic is down also. agent_1:Yes!  I can't believe they have been around over 20 years already since be founded in 1998. agent_2:An innovative company, they are.  They once used live goats instead of people to mow their lawns! agent_1:That is kind of neat.  I'm surprised I haven't seen that happen before.  When there is a disputed border, google maps will tailor their maps to the claims of each country where the interenet browser is located.  Weird and kind of odd fact. agent_2:Technology is progressing so rapidly.  I think it is an interesting that what we refer to as AI constantly changes.  What was considered AI before is normal now. agent_1:AI has really come on strong in the last 2 years.  AI crushed all human records in the puzzle game ""2048"". agent_2:I think it is an important idea to focus on the human aspect as we become more technologically advanced.  That's the focus people in Silicon Valley are taking. agent_1:I agree.  Facebook is developing an AI desinged to understand user emotions, identify objects in photos, and predict users actions. agent_2:I admire John Doerr for writing a book about how to make people work together more productively. agent_1:I'm going to have to look that book up.  I'm not familiar with him or the book.  Speaking of books, I didn't know Kristen Stewart co-authored a paper about AI. agent_2:Yeah, you should read the book.  Learning how to make teams work together more productively is useful because companies perform better when their teams are more motivated I guess. agent_1:I'm going to look it up when we're done here.  Are you a big Amazon user?  I am. agent_2:Yes, I use Amazon all the time.  I suppose it's hard not to use Amazon either.  They are the largest internet retailer in the world. agent_1:I agree.  I didn't know that they also owned IMDB since 1998.  Probably so they could direct people to buy the movies over at Amazon. lol agent_2:Yeah, it seems like they are grabbing the market anywhere they can, from books, entertainment, and much more. agent_1:They even have their own in-house brand called AmazonBasics, which sells low-end products.  agent_2:They even control more than it seems because they are a cloud provider.  It's almost like they are becoming the internet. agent_1:It's kind of sad that all these brick and mortar stores are closing because of all this technology.  Amazon has a contract with the US postal service to deliver packages on Sundays now too.

I can understand , I am more terrified of crocodiles  but it seems they are closer to birds than to snakes! agent_1:Some snakes can even fly to catch their prey so thats scary agent_2:Wow, I would like to see that!  And did you know its head is designed to swallow prays larger than them agent_1:Yeah I did know that, thats actually a bit disgusting, watching them eat prey agent_2:It looks like monkeys are terrified of snakes too! agent_1:They are? monkey are smart, they should stay as far as they can of snakes, dangerous animals agent_2:Maybe you are terrified of snakes!

Fox News once tried to sue to get the show to stop parodying them.  agent_1:I love the Simpsons! not so much Fox news though, they deserve to parodied agent_2:They practically ARE a parody! Do you remember their version of the Daily show from 2007? Man, it was terrible. Really, really terrible. It was canceled after 13 episodes.  agent_1:with Jon Stewart? the one on Comedy Central? agent_2:Yeah, fox tried to copy it with their own show called the Half Hour News Hour.  agent_1:oh I thought you were saying The Daily Show was bad and got cancelled! yea Fox should not have copied that show. Did you know Fox News and IGN are owned by the same company? agent_2:I did not know that. But I'm sure Rupert Murdoch owns dozens of companies I don't know about. Another thing I didn't know -- Hillary Clinton was the president of the You ng Republicans in college.  agent_1:wow! her views sure have shifted a lot since then, huh/ agent_2:I'd say. Nixon actually proposed a guaranteed minimum wage, the only president to ever do so.  agent_1:which surprises me , I always thought that that was something that pretty much everyone had touched upon in their time in office at least a little bit agent_2:Yeah, I was surprised too. Another surprising fact: Tea Party/GOP poster child Ayn Rand was on Social Security and Medicare.  agent_1:wow. I never cared for her books, did you? agent_2:No. Couldn't even finish the one I started. Canada's first official currency was playing cards! Now that's cool.  agent_1:sometimes i wish they still used stuff like that! id be rich! haha agent_2:Haha. Hawaii passed single payer healthcare in 2009, but the governor wouldn't sign it into law.

Do you know why managers wear uniforms? agent_2:Yep, because they are technically able to play for their team if the need arises. I don't recall ever seeing one play though. agent_1:That's correct. I've never seen it happen either.  agent_2:I've heard that up from 1981 until 2005 a married couple actually scheduled all 2,430 major league games played each year. agent_1:Wow! That's some serious devotion to the game.  agent_2:Yeah it is. I find it fascinating that baseball is so popular in Japan. I remember watching games when I was stationed there and the crowds were amazing, even for small local games. agent_1:I had heard that it was so huge over there that they are surprised that it is our past time.  agent_2:Did you ever collect baseball cards? agent_1:I did not. How about you?	agent_2:I collected them with my dad when I was a kid. I wish I could have found a collection like this one man did.

If you went on Mount Everest would you take a selfie at the top? Apparently they have 3-g service there agent_2:That would be great, taking a selfie in the top of the tallest mountain, I didnt know you could get addicted to the internet agent_1:I did know that, I'm probably addicted right now haha. And yes if you use the internet too much you can get addicted to clicking links agent_2:That is just crazy, its a good thing there a copy stored in the library of Alexandria, I cant imagine my life without the internet now agent_1:No I agree with you. I wonder how often they back it up at the Alexandria library though? Do you believe that there is extraterrestrial life in the galaxy? agent_2:I do, we are not alone in the world, the universe is so big that there must be alien life in other planets, galaxies agent_1:Yes I think you're right. Have you heard of the Drake equation? It's an equation that calculates the probability that life exists outside of hours in the universe and I think that it has determined that there should be life there somewhere	agent_2:No havent heard of it, and then I agree with that equation, there are firefighters that are trained on how to treat aliens in case of a crash or an invasion	agent_1 dislikes TV shows. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV shows', 'food', 'restaurant'].

Did you know the cat used in the opening scene of The Godfather was actually a stray they found on set? I thought that was pretty cool! agent_1:Oh that is super cool. From rags to riches. A cats life must be nice. They spend over half their life sleeping! agent_2:That us true. Ha! I would like to visit one of those cat cafes over in Japan that lets you pay by the hour to drink and play with cats! I bet that's so interesting! agent_1:That would be fun! Also there is a town in Alaska that has a cat mayor! agent_2:Is that so? That's a little odd! Ha! Did you ever hear about the physicist that published his cat as coauthor so he could avoid criticism by writing in first person plural? agent_1:Haha I never knew about that. However I also like dogs too. They were the first species to be domesticated! agent_2:I love dogs as well! It's crazy only dogs and elephants are the only animals that can understand pointing, isn't it? agent_1:Yeah I agree I would think more animals would understand that. Google also prefers dogs to cats which is kind of funny that they declare such a thing. agent_2:I know, right? I wonder if they have vending machines around their buildings that releases water and food in exchange for bottles like Istanbul does. It'd be nice if our country could do that!  agent_1:Yeah probably not a ton of strays in Palo Alto! But yeah I think that is a cool idea to promote recycling.  agent_2:Agreed and help stray dogs as well. I also think its crazy that dogs can't see as many different colors as we humans can.  agent_1:Yeah that is interesting. I think it's funny when owners put shirts on their dogs. They probably put Hawaiian shirts on their dogs in Hawaii! agent_2:Ha! Probably so. You know, I've always loved the term man's best friend. They do so much for humans like companionship, hunting, protecting, pulling and even therapeutic roles, man's best friend is the perfect term, in my opinion! agent_1:Yeah totally agree with you. Did you know that the official business attire in Hawaii is the aloha shirt instead of a traditional suit and tie? agent_2:Is it really? That's kind of funny! Ha! I do know the pallbearers at Billy Mays' funeral wore khakis and blue shirts. That was very nice of them. agent_1:Interesting. In china the gang layered as many shirts as possible and popped their collars! agent_2:Now that's interesting. Ha! I also think it's interesting that button down is when collar tips fasten to the body of the shirt and button up does not. I never really realized that!	agent_1:Yeah I didn't know that either.

Also, it's too cold in some ballparks early in the season.

Paul is a very common name, ever heard of Paul Ryan? agent_2:Paul Ryan was the speaker of the house.  He left. agent_1:Yah. I wonder if he's going to try and run for 2020 election for the GOP. agent_2:I don't know.  By the way McCarthy is House Minority Leader (a republican) agent_1:Ahh. that makes a bit more sense.. lol. agent_2:I guess so.  Ryan tried to shore up his power prior to leaving the house. agent_1:Definitely, I could see that. Although incumbent typically is chosen to represent the prior winning party, I don't know if the GOP is willing to deal with Trump anymore. agent_2:It is weird.  Why were Ryan concerned about its donors not contributing $$?  He was going to leave anyway. agent_1:It's all about having the funds/access to funds.  agent_2:for the republican party in general?   agent_1:Yes. The republican party needs donors so they can properly campaign. I guarantee that the Democrats will get a bit of pool money this year to campaign. We saw this in the 2018 midterm elections. agent_2:Ryan endorsed McCarthy to replace him. agent_1:I thought the current speaker is Nancy Pelosi since they took majority during the 2018 elections agent_2:It was in case the republican party won the majority.  Thus, it was decided prior to the midterm. agent_1:Oh i see. Politics, I try to keep up with them but it's just too time consuming.  agent_2:If you take it too seriously, it could be very stressful.

They promised air conditioned arenas that would reduce temps by 30 degrees celsius!	agent_1:But I guess the decision to make it not in the summer 2022, but in low season like February or November.

You have a favorite song? agent_2:She loves you, Yeah, yeah, yeah!  Only because we played it while I was in Junior High band and we thought we were cool! agent_1:One of the songs I like is ""Come Together.""

Not everyone thinks so though, Amazon can come with difficulties in transportation and shoot up the housing costs of whatever city it's in.  agent_2:They do make an impact wherever they go. I found interesting that there is a building named after the first amazon.com customer	agent_1:I heard they're considering Washington as a place for their 2nd HQ, wherever they put the building is going to get a huge boost!

Do you like dogs? agent_1:I love dogs, they have 12 types of blood agent_2:I had no idea about that.  i guess that means it's hard for them to get blood transfers when they need one.   agent_1:yeah but good things is that there are dog blood drives agent_2:Are there really?  I have never seen or heard about one before. I would definitely take my dog to give blood if I could. agent_1:Yeah not sure which countries have them though. do you know how tou can help dogs in Istanbul? agent_2:I  think I have heard about that country having vending machines for food and water for stray dogs. All that is required for payment is plastic bottles. agent_1:yeah I really like that approach, that is super nice for the dogs and the environment agent_2:I like it too.  America and actually, all other countries, should adopt that approach.  Dogs are very smart. They are the only animal other than an elephant that understands pointing. agent_1:that is true, you are right. google even prefers dogs agent_2:I am glad to hear that for some reason!  I like knowing that one of my favorite sites to use likes dogs. I am surprised though that they have taken a stand regarding it. agent_1:yeah it is in their code of conduct even agent_2:Pretty impressive!  I will tell you something equally as impressive.  I know for a fact that dogs watch television.  They are not colorblind and they understand a great many of our words. agent_1:yeah they just see less colors than we do agent_2:They have had such a long history of association with humans thought that they understand human behavior. agent_1:yeah exactly, they are known as our best friends after all agent_2:Yes they are.  It's weird to me that they can thrive on a starch rich diet.  It seems like they would prefer to have meat. agent_1:yeah, it is their diet from the wild so that makes sense	agent_2:Now that you mention it, it does. I have seen stray dogs that have been dumped by people eat corn and grass in fields before.  It's sad that people dump dogs, especially when they can do so many different things.

I was upset when they lost game 7 to the dodgers.  agent_1:I used to live in Wisconsin so still happy when they win.  LA team looks pretty good too. agent_2:Nice! Yeah LA has been really good the last few seasons, I think they will have another good one next year.  agent_1:Do you think next year will favor slugging hitters again? agent_2:I think it will.  I think there will be even more home runs next year, how about you? agent_1:I think so as well.  agent_2:Did you watch much of the world series this year? agent_1:No, I missed it, I work odd hours. agent_2:Yeah after the Brewers lost I didn't have too much interest.  agent_1:Wow, I just read that in 1973 two yankees pitchers swapped families permanently, is that crazy or what? agent_2:That is wild!  I know Babe Ruth was a famous Yankee, did you ever see the movie the pride of the yankees? agent_1:I have not, to be honest I'm not a sports fan.  agent_2:I watched it recently it was pretty good, Babe Ruth played himself in the movie, a good Yankee movie.  agent_1:That is interesting!  Did you see they suspended Don Mattingly because he refused to get a haircut?  I can't imagine that happening these days. agent_2:Yeah, I remember the Simpsons doing a parody of that one time as well.  agent_1:Now you're talking!

I do love music except of stuff like accordions.  I definitely wouldn't pay $25 a ticket for that kind of music. agent_1:No, and it's shocking that a creed concert was so bad that people filed a lawsuit against them, on the other hand I don't really like creed so I'm not that surprised haha agent_2:Wow, they must have been really buzzed.

They must like doing it cause that has to take its toll.  I guess performers like that go all the way back to ancient Greece and Rome.  We still use their acoustic designs for venues/amphitheaters.  agent_1:Yes that is probably why Pink Floyd played the live concert in that Roman amphitheater, even though there was no one their the acoustics must have been amazing, it's shocking they didn't record a video at least agent_2:No kidding... I would like to see that.  Pink Floyd is very creative but on the dark side.

They offered a free Whopper to unfriend 10 people. agent_2:I dont know the reasoning behind it,  but I wouldnt mind a free whopper lol 	agent_1:Yeah, that made me a little hungry.

4803	agent_1:How familiar are you with the hunting and gathering culture people used to have? agent_2:Not too familiar,      Although I've read a bit from researcher Nicole Kruspe discussing odor. agent_1:Although our sense of smell may not be as developed as some species, odor played an essential role in our survival. However, odor is unique in that people don't name the specific odor itself, but rather what it reminds us of. agent_2:Interesting.   Western scholars dismissed scents as unknowable, or at least unnameable for millenia. agent_1:True, but recent studies by Majid found that the Jahai, who are hunter gatherers still, are able to identify these odors by abstract names. It seems that these hunter gathers & horticulturalists can identify odors, unlike the rest of their world due to their unique cirucmstances. agent_2:True, Kruspe and Majid propose that, when people settle into, say, horticulture or postindustrial society, other senses become relatively more important than smell.  agent_1:McGann states that this ability to distinguish the differences in odor receptors would play a greater role in a more natural, wild environment than the secure urban areas that most horicultural people live. While distinquishing complex smells may save a hunter/gather's life in the wild, it would be as much a life or death situation in most instances in an urban setting. In fact, simple odors like smelling sulfur are enough for most people to avoid dangerous situations.	agent_2:Did you know that Humans (taxonomically, Homo sapiens) are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina.	agent_1 likes humans. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['humans', 'smell', 'no'].

I adore Tupac, and think it's interesting that the Library of Congress chose his music to be included because it's culturally significant.	agent_1:I agree, Kanye's old music was really good. He's just out there. Just like how he thinks AIDS is a man-made disease. 	agent_2 likes music. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'music genre', 'rap'].
1474	agent_1:Hello there, so have you seen any of the Star Wars movies? agent_2:I have seen several. I read Tran who played rose left Instagram after racist messages from fans. agent_1:That is so sad fans are so cruel to people.  I have yet to see her in that movie, I really want to though.  agent_2:Me too. The last Jedi divided it's fans agent_1:Yeah I think each movie does because there are so many of them and they all have their different tastes.  But the personal comments to the actors is just stupid.  agent_2:Did you know Chloe Bennet changed her last name to get in to US easier agent_1:No I didn't know that, I wonder how many people do that when they come here.  	agent_2:Seems like a lot. Apparently they get more call backs with American last names.	agent_1 dislikes job. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['job', 'movie', 'Star Wars'].

So, I watch with her. agent_1:That's cool! Apparently it's so popular in Japan that there surprised it's our (Americas) past time.  agent_2:Yes, I heard about that.  Apparently baseball managers wear uniforms in case they have to play to replace players.	agent_1:I wonder if that's ever happened before?

3861	agent_1:Hello, did you know the dodo bird is actual a sub-family of the pigeon. agent_2:I didn't know that- of course I believe the bird is extinct, isn't it?  This year we recently had a bunch of hummingbirds..that was a first for me and so exciting. SO TINY.. agent_1:I also find it interesting that some birds can fly from alaska to north america without sleeping when they migrate. agent_2:Birds are very interesting because of a lot of facts.  I think it helps with their flight that their bones are hollow so not weighed down.  agent_1:Yes, they are interesting. I did not know that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. I find that very interersting. agent_2:I have watched them pull some to make them nearby.  The way they flit about is so beautiful to watch.  It is almost elegant like a dance. ..performing art! agent_1:Yes, did you know that Jackie Chan manages a k-pop band. I did not know that but i think it's cool. agent_2:It seems that so many you wouldn't think to have other interests do.  Jackie in music, Bruce Lee in dancing.  A championship even! agent_1:It seems to be in a kpop band you have to be tough because they go through bootcamps before being signed. agent_2:Boot camps for bands.. Guess it takes a lot of stamina for the dancing and singing.  Kind of the same I would assume for figure skating.  Can you imagine the work to land a triple axel?	agent_1:That is true. It looks hard.

4557	agent_1:Earth never stops to amaze me, it was formed over 4.5 billion years ago and there is still much to learn about our planet agent_2:I know what you mean.  It is the only object known to have life and we need to know why that is. agent_1:I agree, we must find life in other planets if we want to survive as a species, its sad how 80% of the forests have been destroyed by now agent_2:That is definitely sad and very troubling.  It makes me wonder what will happen to the polar regions with all of the ice. agent_1:Global Warming happened to them and if we dont start caring about our planet we might need to find another one soon. agent_2:Already things are changing.  Did you know that there will be no helium on the planet by the end of this century?  Not only are we losing plants and animals but now we are losing elements. agent_1:I did not know that, I wonder how that will affect us, im sure it will have hidden consequences on life on earth and to think we account to only a small portion of earths history agent_2:I imagine it will have consequences too.  I've heard that when the earth was first formed a day was only just over 5 hours long.  That would be weird.  I guess that means the planet used to be closer to the sun? agent_1:Yeah, it seems that way, or maybe rotated at a bigger speed, you know we  have an embassador in case aliens arrive to the planet or try to make contact with us. agent_2:I didn't know that!  That's actually pretty cool!  I hope he or she is friends with Elon Musk. At the rate he is going, he'll find life before the government does.  He's already planning a colony on Mars. agent_1:Elon Musk is a genious, hopefully he is successful with his colonisation plan, he is also an actor you know agent_2:I didn't know that.  I knew he co founded paypal but I had no idea he acted as well. agent_1:Yeah apparently he acted in a thank you for smoking sketch, and his wife is an actress as well she was in the movie Inception	agent_2:Impressive.

10515	agent_1:Its crazy how Google and Amazon have grown agent_2:It's hard to even believe Google has been around for over twenty years. agent_1:I know right, seems like its been around forever agent_2:And Amazon has been around even longer, since 1994. agent_1:Its a long time, Amazon started as an online bookstore right? agent_2:Yes, but now it's largest Internet retailer in the world! agent_1:It is, it sells everything from books to groceries to pet supplies you name it, I love the company agent_2:It also sells low-end and affordable products under its own brand called AmazonBasics. agent_1:Have you tried the Amazon Basics products? agent_2:Sure. I used Amazon for practically everything, but I also used Google. I guess I'm not alone because when Google went down for about five minutes in 2013, 40% of the web traffic went down with it. agent_1:I love Google as well, you know it was founded by two PHD students in Standford University agent_2:Yeah, and together they own 14 percent of the company, and control about 56% of the stockholder voting power. agent_1:I thought they owned a bigger percentage of the company, I heard the company wants to reoganize some of its interests in a company called Alphabet Inc agent_2:Yes, they actually announced that several years ago. Most recently, Larry Page was removed as the CEO of Google and is now the CEO of Alphabet. agent_1:A guess that makes sense, Google is a big company and it must have more than one CEO for different divisions, have you ever used the Maps app? agent_2:Yeah, it's interesting how they determine the borders of countries with disputed borders.	agent_1:I agree, interesting and they also calculate traffic using android devices that are in movement on the road, thats just genius and bit invasive	agent_2 likes technology. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['technology', 'technology', 'yes'].

Would you try? agent_1:I think I would try it to see what it was like. agent_2:I've seen lots of examples on Facebook of people playing a VR game and getting terrified or surprised. It looks like a lot of fun!	agent_1:I wonder how much the headsets cost for it?  The fist virtual reality game was made in 1968.

Neat that he was a ballet dancer.  Speaking of ballet dancers, I'm told they go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a WEEK.  Talk about being on your toes! agent_1:They sure do! Michael Jackson had specially made shoes for some of his own dance moves. agent_2:Wonder if that how he was able to do that ""extreme lean"" move he does.  (I'm told he owns a patent on the device, but dunno if the device is shoes or something else...)  Did you know Bruce Lee was also a great dancer? agent_1:He won the Hong Kong Cha-Cha in 1958. my kids do the cha cha slide in Call of Duty. agent_2:Hehe. That's funny.  Speaking of kids, they say even babies spontaneously dance when they hear music.  I saw a youtube video once of a baby jamming out to Gangnum Style by Psy.

I don't like how the parameters for what is a planet and what isn't is determined by where and what they orbit. agent_2:Yeah but humans are a weird species, they have laws and rules for everything agent_1:True.  Look at Jupiter's moon Ganymede.  If it orbited the sun it would be a planet by definition. agent_2:Yeah and there is also a planet that orbits 4 stars, that's crazy. agent_1:I wonder how that works. I guess the stars are close together?   agent_2:Maybe, but they would have to be far enough apart so they are not affected by each others gravity fields yet be able to influence the planet that is orbiting them. agent_1:That's true.  So that would mean a very large galaxy.  What do you think of the planet where shards of glass precipitate sidewys at 4500 mph in 2000 degree fahrenheit weather? agent_2:Man that would be scary, imagine is it started raining glass on earth, we would be screwed. agent_1:Yes we would.  For something odd closer to home we've got Venus with it's no seasons. agent_2:Do you play video games? I play probably way more than I should haha. agent_1:I do play some.

The movie had Michael Jackson.  It doesn't have the song ""Be a Lion."" agent_1:I've heard the Wiz as being described as weird, from the description I tend to agree agent_2:It is kind of weird... The music and the dancing are at the core.  You might remember the song ""Ease on Down the Road."" agent_1:Maybe but not that I think of it the normal Wizard of Oz is weird, like really weird so I guess the Wiz should be weird too agent_2:There is a big cultural difference between the two, like a farm in KS vs. Detroit.  Funny, it is at the Ford Theater in D.C.   agent_1:Ford Theater, isn't that were Lincoln was assassinated? agent_2:Yep.  I didn't realize it was still a theater.  I would have imagined it as a museum.

There is so many cool things to explore such as computers or chemistry.  agent_1:Did you know that Albert Einstein was born in Germany and is best known for for his equation E= mc2? agent_2:I did know that. I find it intersting he wrote to Roosevelt about nuclear energy so long ago. We tend to think of it as a modern thing beyond the A bomb agent_1:It seems ironic that scientist put men on the moon but Harrison Schmitt was the only one to actually walk on the moon. agent_2:I think astronauts need a different temperment than someone who works in a lab or engineering. There has to be a sense of thrill seeking that seems to be lacking in a lot of scientists.  agent_1:So true. The world wide web was invented in 1989 by and english scientist working in Switzerland for a state funded research organization. . .How much it changed the world! agent_2:It really has! I think it has impacted our economy and countries in ways that are unimaginable. I wonder if they knew what they were inventing when they did it. agent_1:I am sure they had no idea! There were two geniuses that invented things without thought of how they were to be used Hertz and Maxwell.  Had this thought that curiosity shoud drive invention agent_2:I think curiousity is a great thing. The internet sure has helped with that. Imagine the information we have access to now that generations past had so much trouble accessing.  agent_1:So often only governments and universities can fund the research for projects in science without an immediate need. It is kind of like an essay in Harpers magazine in 1939 titled ""The usefulness of Useless Knowledge. agent_2:If only that money was put to better use. agent_1:It is a bit like the scientist Hertz that worked out electromagnetism. Macaroni, did very little of the science but he was credited with inventing radio!  agent_2:I think the pointless project funding goes back to entitlement spending. People start to think they can spend just because they want to. "	agent_1:I think that was on the tails of the industrial revolution.

I find it amusing that MLB team managers wear uniforms because they can play if needed. agent_2:I follow the Nationals, what about you?  agent_1:I follow the Chicago Cubs. Have you heard about the guy that found the hidden baseball cards? agent_2:Yeah, apparently they were worth millions of dollars.  agent_1:Yes! Hidden away in his grandfathers attic since the 1940's. I wonder if the grandfather forgot them, or hid them so someone would get a big surprise? agent_2:I'm not sure. It has me thinking about the time my mom threw away my card collection.  agent_1:Oh, hopefully no good ones. Isn't it funny that soccer-baseball is the name for kickball in Canada. agent_2:Yeah, that is pretty funny. Is it a big sport up there?  agent_1:I am no sure. I know in Japan baseball is super popular. agent_2:I've known that for awhile. I'm surprised they don't know it is popular over here though.  agent_1:I know! That shocks me too.  agent_2:Are you a fan of the World Series?  agent_1:Yes, I am. As a Cubs fan it has been difficult.

You have a favorite song? agent_2:She loves you, Yeah, yeah, yeah!  Only because we played it while I was in Junior High band and we thought we were cool! agent_1:One of the songs I like is ""Come Together."" Did you know it was actually written for Timothy Leary's 1969 California governor campaign?   agent_2:I didn't know that.  Interesting. agent_1:Another one I like is A Hard Days Night.  Think I relate to the line that goes ""And I've been working like a dog."" 1) Because I'm overworked and 2) because I'm a dog person. You like dogs? agent_2:Yes, I am a dog person.

Wonder what colors they can see!  My daughter so desperately wants a dog she spent an afternoon writing a poem about why she deserves a dog.  A for effort. Lots of rhyming like Dr. Seuss.   agent_2:Oh, get that baby a doggie.  Every kid needs a dog, it'll help teach her responsibility and accountability. Speaking of poetry, do you like it? agent_1:Yeah, those were some of her arguments.  Kinda dreaded learning the classics.  I remember having to memorize The Raven. agent_2:Funny, I remember that one, as well as Anabelle Lee.  You know Edgar Allan Poe only got $9.00 for The Raven?"	agent_1:Dang!

I thought the red and blue would have started earlier.  I feel like I have seen it forever. agent_1:same, also only dem or rep president since 1853, time for an independent? agent_2:I agree with that, they have least funding though agent_1:true, hows this for voting, Indian govt set up poll in a forest with lions agent_2:that is crazy agent_1:they had one voter, talk about restricting the votes agent_2:Hardly feels like a majority.  Do you follow the Senate? agent_1:not so much, i like the idea of the candy desk where they keep a drawer of candy for the senators though agent_2:I love that idea.  As well as women staging a protest for pants suits. agent_1:yes, hard to believe they could not wear pants until 1993! agent_2:Craziness.  Are you registered to vote?	agent_1:yes, i think it is important	agent_2 dislikes politics. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'politics', 'no'].
2292	agent_1:Do you like Tennis? agent_2:I do not, but I am a fan of Serena Williams, ever since she voiced a character in Avatar; The Last Airbender. agent_1:I didn't know she did that.

7337	agent_1:Hey! Did you know that until 1998, British politicians had to wear a top hat when making a point of order in the house of commons? agent_2:I did not know that, but it could be because hats are worn for various reasons which include ceremonial ones, like the house of commons! agent_1:Exactly. The most popular hat in the Old West was actually the bowler, not the Cowboy hat. agent_2:So you are saying that all of the westerns have got it wrong? Haha, all of the cowboys should have been wearing bowler hats, doesn't make them seem quite as tough.  agent_1:I guess so! I was surprised when I learned that. Imagine the Marlboro cowboy in a bowler! That wouldn't work though, because a cowboy really does need a cowboy hat to protect against the sun and rain. agent_2:I agree, it is just not the same. You know how cowboys would tip their hats in greeting? That originated from knights raising their face visors to show they were friendly.  agent_1:That's very interesting and makes sense. How do you feel about snakes? I'm not a big fan. I'd go to New Zealand, where there are none. agent_2:I would be joining you in New Zealand. Snakes make my skin crawl, always have. It is a long held fear of mine. New Zealand is lucky! agent_1:Yeah that's how I feel too! There is a genus of flying snakes that can launch themselves. If I saw that in person I would die. agent_2:I would as well, it is bad enough to see them slither around, but flying...no! I was reading that the fear of snakes is hard-wired not just in human brains, but in monkey brains as well.  agent_1:Well humans and monkeys are distantly related lol. There are legless lizards also. I don't mind legged lizards, but I don't think I would look at a legless lizard as anything less than a snake. agent_2:If it doesn't have legs, I am checking out. A legless lizard is a snake! You know, I was reading that crocodiles are closer related to birds then snakes and lizards. I would have never guessed that.  agent_1:Haha checking out. Agreed. I wouldn't have guessed that about crocodiles either. I always call alligators/crocodiles dinosaurs, and I heard that chickens are likely descendants of dinosaurs.. so maybe I am onto something?  agent_2:If you have seen Jurassic park and believe it (I kinda do) then you would agree. Hey, do you like dancing? Did you know that it can be categorized and described by its choreography. I am horrible, but its fun.  agent_1:I love Jurassic Park and I do love dancing. I'm not the best dancer either but I have a good time. Apparently Bruce Lee was a great dancer and won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship in 1958. agent_2:I bet that is why he was so good at martial arts. Dancing probably helped keep him limber and light on his feet. I feel like those would be important skills to have.  agent_1:Good point! Babies spontaneously dance when they hear music and smile more when they hit the beat! I can attest to that, I have one at home and he loves music.	agent_2:That is adorable, baby dancing is the best, it is so pure for the joy of it! You know who else was a dancer?

What's your favorite one that you remember? agent_2:I saw Rush a couple of times. that was great. they were so good live.	agent_1:I bet!

6629	agent_1:Good Morning! Do you like to travel? agent_2:I do, I travel a lot for work, but even more for leisure. I wish I could use the commuter bus the Dutch are creating. It's designed to travel at 160mph! agent_1:I would rather do that than be in Iceland where there is no rail service!	agent_2:I agree with that.

It's animated, right? With lots of songs? agent_2:Yes it uses computer animation and it has love songs. It was super popular. There's a song that all the little kids were saying called""Let It Go and I guess it's based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale called the snow queen"	agent_1:HC wrote so many great stories.

2786	agent_1:Hello, do you ever watch Fox News? agent_2:I usually don't watch it. I understand that it's popular. agent_1:Fox discussed the possibility of creating a cable channel that would only air the Simpsons. agent_2:That is an idea that might work, but now I figure people are on the Internet. Maybe a YouTube channel? agent_1:Possibly...The gaming website IGN is actually owned by Fox News. agent_2:Oh, I didn't know that. I guess Fox owns a lot of things out there. A gaming site? Hm. agent_1:Yea very interesting. Fox News is watched more than CNN and MSNBC combined.	agent_2:I believe it. CNN has its own bias, as does MSNBC.

8167	agent_1:Are you a fan of Jazz?  agent_2:hi how are you? yes, i like jazz. You? agent_1:I do. So does Clint Eastwood apparently. agent_2:Yeah, he plays piano. he also composes too, ive heard. agent_1:I didn't know that. That is pretty cool.  agent_2:He is allergic to horses, i think, so maybe he spends more time at the piano now. agent_1:Interesting, I wonder how he shot all of those films then? 	agent_2:I think he wasnt allergic at first, but then developed an allergy. maybe he is getting treatment now? i dont know	It is unclear if the agent_2 likes or dislikes health. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['health', 'movie', 'actor'].
9268	agent_1:Hello,  did you every us president with a beard has been republican? agent_2:Hi. I just read that, and find that to be pretty funny! That's one of those facts that is fun but meaningless.  agent_1:lol yup useless information.  Just like there hasnt been a us president who wasnt rep or dem since 53. agent_2:So I guess that last time there was a third party candidate that was successful was over 150 years ago. I wonder what the name of the party was? That was just before the civil war, unless I have forgotten my dates. agent_1:Good question,  I am not sure.   agent_2:I wonder if there fact about a republican being elected that wasn't a Nixon or Bush (since 1928) was written before Trump's election? He ran as a Republican and won. agent_1:Not sure. did you know the taller candidate won the presidental election 75% of the time.? agent_2:Yes, I've seen that before, that taller men win more than shorter men. It's funny that Truman wouldn't be photographed in Dumbo the Elephant, since an elephant is the symbol of the Republican party. Another fun party fact! agent_1:Yeah thats extreme kinda. lol its Dumbo hes a disney character.  Did you see previews for the new Dumbo live action movie about to come out? agent_2:No! I didn't hear about that. So they will use live elephants? I recently watched the last Disney movie, The Nutcracker and the 4 realms.  agent_1:Haha I think the elephants are cgi.  But the actors are real.  I seen that movie,  it was kinda boring in my opinion. agent_2:I know! We were disappointed because we the cg on the previews was great. But the plot and acting were fairly bad! agent_1:I know right,  the cgi was awesome,  so colorful and nice.  My daughter wanted to see it and of course she loved it,  we were falling asleep on it lol  agent_2:Maybe that is it! The little kids like it but it didn't come through for adults. Disney  is usually good at reaching both audiences. agent_1:Yes usually,  it appeals to adults too. I really liked that movie Inside Out,  that had a lot of adult jokes in it and very entertaining to children.  agent_2:Speaking of your daughter, is she into Elmo and the other Seasame Street characters? I thought it was funny that Elmo testified before Congress! agent_1:haha,  she used to be.  Not anymore,  shes into all things princess right now.  That is awesome fact though.  agent_2:I really wonder what he testified about, unless it was to lobby to continue funding PBS or the arts or something in that area? agent_1:haha.  I learned that the firsst woman was elected in congres before she even had the right to vote,  weird huh	agent_2:Yes, that is very weird and it just really strange to think about how much things have changed in politics and society in general!	agent_1 dislikes politics. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'TV shows', 'character'].
10996	agent_1:hey there, do you like robots? agent_2:I think they are pretty fascinating, actually the term robotics was invented by scifi writer Issac Asimov.  What about you? agent_1:Even Michael jackson took deep interest in robots. agent_2:Robots can be made to look human or not, which do you prefer?  I don't really mind them taking human form but in the end they are just machines. agent_1:I know so I am not sure why the need for them to look like humans agent_2:Apparently Boston Dynamics is making a 4 legged dog robot named SpotMini, so now they are creating a market for pet robots too. agent_1:cool. they have trained robots to debone a chicekn with surgical precision agent_2:There are clips on YouTube about SpotMini.  It is a bit special since it is not wheeled it can move across all kinds of terrain, agent_1:That is so cool maybe I should check it out to see what it is all about agent_2:That is the joy of computers because we can access all this information.  And now they are controlling all kinds of industrial and consumer devices! agent_1:True. the us military uses xbox 30  controllers to control theur eod robots agent_2:That is awesome.  I believe that robotics can help those who are handicapped, for instance a robotic arm a person could control with their thoughts. agent_1:Exactly. ANd now they make exoskeletons that can help people stand up. so cool agent_2:The scary part will be when a robot starts to think on its own instead of what has been programmed.  We don't want a real life Megatron! agent_1:That is true. Do you weatch lots of videos of robst and other on yoututube ?	agent_2:Sometimes I do.  Youtube basically has any topic you can think of.  The very first video was a guy talking about an elephant if you can believe that.	agent_1 likes video. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['video', 'toy', 'SpotMini'].
9666	agent_1:Hi do you like Wonder woman movie agent_2:Yea, Patty Jenkins did a great job directing Wonder Woman agent_1:Yes pretty good one in the DC universe agent_2:Yea, Gal Gadot was a perfect casting choice to play Wonder Woman agent_1:Yes she is perfect. during audition she was not aware that she is auditioning for Wonder woman agent_2:I never knew that. I also didn't know Wonder Woman's first film appearance was in the Lego Movie agent_1:Gal gadot has seved in israel defence force . I thought she was paegent queen agent_2:That is pretty cool. Did you know Wonder Woman was the justice Society's secretary in 1941? agent_1:no but it was the highest superhero origin movie. may be marvel movie may break this record soon agent_2:Probably. Do you read literature? It used to be an olympic event agent_1:Yes had read few .  but FDA has burned 6 tons of literature in act of censorship. I dont think that was a good act  agent_2:That is very strange, not as strange as the heavy metal as a form of literature course taught at Texas A&M agent_1:not they are in electronic form and burning is not that easy poor FDA agent_2:That is odd, I wonder if it had to do with the recent development of Romantic Kissing in literature agent_1:do you know that Winston Churchill won a nobel prize for literature agent_2:No, I figured he would win for peace, not literature agent_1:some things are hard to believe . Earth;s day was 5.5 hrs long when formed agent_2:That's pretty crazy, plus earth's magnetic field reverses every 200,000-300,000 years	agent_1:Gravitional interaction between Earth and Moon gradually slows its rotation	agent_2 likes astronomy. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['astronomy', 'entertainment', 'actress'].
12017	agent_1:Hi, do you like tennis? agent_2:Not that much. If they still used a Helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts like they did in the 1969 open I would watch. agent_1:What if they did that while they played? It would increase the degree of difficulty.. would you watch? agent_2:Haha that would be funny and kind of scary! The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days. That would bore me for sure. agent_1:I remember that. It was a Jon Isner match in like wimbeldon. They had to stop due to the darkness and exhaustion. agent_2:The Roger Federer of paddle tennis wasn't that great apparently because US Open quarterfinalist Gael Monfils beat him within days of learning how to play. agent_1:Huh... No black man has won the us open since 1968 when arthur ashe won. agent_2:Wow, wonder why. Federer has one 20 grand slam singles title, the most ever for a male player. agent_1:Did you hear how he tore his meniscus?	agent_2:I'm not sure, was it in a game?	agent_1 likes video games. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['video games', 'sports', 'tennis player'].
5271	agent_1:The Braves seem to have a good start on the season, they are the most rested team agent_2:Hi, how are you? I don't really know the Braves. They're a big market team, so I expect them to get marquee players. agent_1:They have a good team, so there are two points of view, a well reseted team vs a team that comes into season with a lot of practice, which one do you prefer? agent_2:I would practice. I think skills get rusty. Baseball is a team sport, so they should work together. Other teams will have practiced. agent_1:I  think practice is better, a well rested team might begin with some troubles, games are neccesary to adapt. agent_2:Yes, I would want people to practice. They need to prepare for the season. Did you know that baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if the need arises? agent_1:Ive always wondered about that, do you know if it ever happened in a game? agent_2:I suppose back in the day one of the players was chosen to be manager. Handled both jobs. Now, not necessary. agent_1:I see well the game is really popular in Japan, seems like it has a lot of fans over there agent_2:The game is very popular. I think that the Japanese have made their own version of it. Uniquely Japanese. agent_1:They did? wow, they must really like it them did you watch the Wold Series last year? agent_2:I didn't get the chance to watch a lot of it. I know that the Dodgers lost again. agent_1:I didnt watch it either, its a game with a lot of tradition almost 120 years since the first World Series, so 120 champions agent_2:The Cubbies won back to back WS. Then after that? It's like a curse. What should they do? agent_1:They should get like an exorcism done by all religions lol, it does seem like a curse agent_2:The sports is popular here, but not around the world. The women's world cup had higher television ratings than the world series in the united states. agent_1:It did? guess not only the mens category is popular then, before 1969 the team with the best record would advanced to the WS that has changed now agent_2:I think the playoffs are fun, but probably a good way to get more money. The fans don't seem to mind. agent_1:So the Chicago Cubs and their curse, to think the Cubs and the Braves are the oldest teams in the league	agent_2:The Braves have moved a lot, I think.

11648	agent_1:Hi, how are you? agent_2:Not bad.    Do you know anything about Henry David Thoreau? agent_1:I know a bit about him, he is a environmentalist I believe, right? agent_2:Yes, but he was also an author.    Lots of others were inspired by his example. agent_1:I get his point though, I mean 80% of the earth's forests have been destroyed already agent_2:Speaking of the earth, how old is the planet? agent_1:As far as I know, I think about 4.5 billion years ago agent_2:That is a long time ago.    How much of the surface of the planet is water? agent_1:I believe it is about 71%, I was always told 3/4ths when I was younger agent_2:That makes sense.     Do you know what the core is made from? agent_1:It is essentially iron and heat, so hot most of it is liquid, and that is what causes volcano eruptions agent_2:Interesting.     Did you know the earth is quite a bit more dense than the sun! agent_1:I did not know that actually, but I guess it kinda makes sense since the sun is mostly gas agent_2:I know there are some other names people call our planet.    Do you know any of them?	agent_1:No, I am not too familiar, what other names do people call it?	agent_2 likes food. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['food', 'environmentalism', 'environmentalism'].
7446	agent_1: Hello,  did you know that more than 80% of the earths forests have been destroyed? agent_2:That is sad. I hope we can reverse that  statistic.  agent_1:Yeah that is really sad.  I recently read that earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century.  agent_2:I also think it is interesting that when earth was formed, a day was only 5.5 hours long. I wonder why that changed? agent_1:I don't know,  maybe it slowed its rotation eventually?  That's pretty weird.   agent_2:Do you believe in aliens? The UN appointed ambassadors to extraterrestrials.  agent_1:Yes,  definitely.  Thats cool lol at least they are prepared!  Do you believe in aliens? agent_2:I am not sure. I feel like there is more life out there. I wonder if they will make contact with earth? agent_1:Im assuming so,  otherwise what would the ambassador have to study?  lol how else can he be prepared if theres no evidence? agent_2:I am not sure. Do you have any pets?  agent_1:Yup,  I have a dog.  How about you? agent_2:I have a cat. Did you know that there are cat cafes in japan and taiwan where people can pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks! agent_1:lol yeah,  theres all sorts of cafes like that,  Ive been to a meerkat cafe,  a bird cafe and a raccoon cafe before.  agent_2:That is really interesting. I would like that. I wish i slept as much as cats. When a cat reaches 15 years old it has usually spent 10 years of its life sleeping. agent_1:Thats a lot of sleeping!  Theres is a cat named stubbs in alaska that is a mayor lol  agent_2:I love that. It has been the mayor since 1997.	agent_1:lol I wonder how they decided that or what his duties are lol 	agent_2 likes work. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['work', 'politics', 'mayor'].

Some people are saying the last jedi underpeformed agent_2:I don't agree with... I liked it a lot! agent_1:We'll just have to hope episode 9 shuts everyone up agent_2:I am sure of it!  That's funny George lucas's wife won an acedemy award agent_1:I know and george lucas didnt! But she did have an influence on vital scenes. Including obi wan's death agent_2:Yeah i know, but still :)  That's cool, that they dubbed it in navajo language agent_1:I wonder if they still had james earl jones. You cant change vader's voice! agent_2:Not really sure! and i soooo agree! agent_1:I think 8.5 billion total revenue makes all the movies pretty successful agent_2:WOW... that's a lot of money!  Love how fox lost billions because they didn't believe in the franchise! agent_1:It make Lucas a billionaire! The value of the franchise is 65 billion agent_2:Whoaaaaa!  chaching!  You see some of the star wars are on Netflix? agent_1:Yeah, I need to check out Solo. I havent watched that yet. Heard that also was received poorly agent_2:I am sure it is great!  These people are just haters... especially since Disney bought the franchise! agent_1:We can all agree that Luke Skywalker is the man though! Although he was almost a girl	agent_2:Really?  WOW!

Did you hear about the satellite lost on mars? agent_1:yes that was typical of us companies to use the wrong system of measurement. nobody uses imperial except maybe beer makers. maybe the guys were talking about beer? LOL agent_2:Quite possible.  Or distracted by the selfies they were posting to facebook.  Here's me and the rover!  :) agent_1:boy, those selfies on mars are really a distraction. i guess the IT guys on mars are never going to hear the end of the problems with the net, since the Cloud is back on earth. agent_2:So very true.  I wonder if the like button would be  legal on mars.  There are parts of Germany where it isnt. agent_1:if germany gets to mars first, they'll probably ban the like button for the entire planet! agent_2:Zuckerburg probably has problems with Mars- he has red-green colorblindness.  Thats why facebook is blue. agent_1:he will spend money to find a cure for r-g colorblindness. or he will upload his consciousness into a machine with better vision. he will prevail in the battle against death. agent_2:Both him and elon musk! agent_1:elon will have a secret lab on mars to build his robot army to conquer  the earth. he and mark will have a battle royale in their robot bodies. agent_2:That would be the fight of a lifetime..  Id give the edge to Musk agent_1:good ol musky. he would be a great martian overlord. Anyway, great chat! agent_2:You too!  Have a great day! agent_1:Rock on! Have a great day!

Do you? agent_1:I do, Im really bad at it but I think its a great sport, it can be played among two people which is a great advantage. Do you like the sport? agent_2:I do like to watch some games.  It looks like it can be a lot of fun!  I've heard though that the longest match in history was 11 hours long and lasted over 3 days.  That i'm not so sure i would like. agent_1:That is a really long game, they must have been exhausted and the fans bored out already.  agent_2:Probably so.  But tennis is very competitive so the players though exhausted most likely kept fighting. agent_1:Do you like polo shirts? cool fact about them but they were actually created by a tennis player agent_2:I do and I had no idea about that! I assumed polo players wore them and they became a fashion thing. agent_1:They were invented by Rene The Crocodile Lacoste, it was adopted later by polo players but it seems they stole all the credit lol agent_2:Yep they did!  Hey, do you watch netflix? agent_1:I do like to watch Netflix, a lot of interesting content for a small price.  agent_2:I agree.  It's weird to think that it started back in 1997 though.  I guess because it is focusing on streaming now it just seems like a newer company. agent_1:Its worth $2 billion dollars by now, so yeah, I wonder if the service will be around much longer agent_2:Two billion dollars and to think it all started because Reed Hastings was mad about a forty dollar late fee on a vhs movie!	agent_1:Yeah a $40 late fee and the movie Apollo 13, I wonder if theres a tennis documentary on Netflix, maybe Roger Federer appears on it. 	agent_2 dislikes movie. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'sports', 'basketball'].
10234	"agent_1:Hi There! Do you like movies? agent_2:I like movies, it is a form of art. .  agent_1:This is interesting..Even though spartacus had a cinematographer, stanley kubrick took the camera away from him and did it himself.  agent_2:You have to do it yourself, he was very talented, I saw some of his films, but never Spartacus, is it good ?  agent_1:It is! But this is interesting too..even though he did almost none of the work, when spartacus got the academy award for best cinematography, it went to the credited cinematographer, and not kubrick. agent_2:Probably, some kind of union thing, like he was not an official cinematographer.  I wonder if they gave him something for it.  agent_1:Thats a good question! No woman has ever been nominated for the academy award for best cinematography. agent_2:I guess it is because there is not many female cinematographer because they would not hire them. Sexism still exist.  agent_1:That is terrible. A woman has never even been nominated. agent_2:Yeah, do you see movies made by a woman ? agent_1:I haven't paid attention to that. I'll have to now. Cinematographer roger deakins has been nominated 13 times for the best cinematography oscar, and has never won. agent_2:He was good but not enough, did he do any comedies ? I like those kind of film.  agent_1:I don't think he did. Do you like Bill murray? Bill murray thinks kung fu hustle is ""the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy"". agent_2:I like Bill Murray, Chinese comedies can be really funny. But I never saw kung fu hustle. Did you ? agent_1:no, not my type of movie! I do like Jack black though. The green lantern film was originally going to be a comedy starring jack black agent_2:That would have changed the tone of the movie, he is very slapstick.  agent_1:Some of his stuff is good, Some bad. Did you watch 3rd rock from the sun?  agent_2:I did when I was young, it was good but not memorable, not like Seinfeld.

10805	agent_1:Do you like audiobooks? agent_2:Yes, do you? I enjoy them a lot! agent_1:I do like them, it saves me a lot of time, I usually listen to one on the way to work, Katharine Graham memoir seems like a good pick agent_2:Yes, it looks very interesting. I think I will enjoy it. All the cover-ups! agent_1:I agree, theres a lot of interesting stories in her memoirs, like anecdotes about ''The Post'', ''The Iron Lady'', I might buy it and pick it as my next audiobook agent_2:Thats good. The Wife Between us sounds like a drama! Would have to be in the mood for that. agent_1:I like the plot, it seems a bit dark, an abused ex-wife  stalking her former husband, thats an odd couple agent_2:yes, I like period pieces, so the Revolution of the Moon sounds interesting! agent_1:That is a great book and Andrea Camilleri is a great author, I like her style,,  agent_2:Good, I love anything on the solar system, the moon, saturn etc. Do you? agent_1:I am in love with the moon, its so beautiful, I envy the astronauts that could see earth from up there, a unique landscape indeed	agent_2:Agree, So glad Nasa made the right choice putting the US flag and not the UN flag!	agent_1 likes flag. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['flag', 'books', 'author'].
8280	"agent_1:Do you like sports? agent_2:I'm not really into sports, but soccer isn't bad. My friend is obsessed with it and was telling me about this guy Freddy Adu who became pro at 14, I think agent_1:Oh tell me more agent_2:Apparently he peaked early though and never really became as great as he could be agent_1:That is a shame. Do you watch the world cup? agent_2:No, but my boyfriend has been trying to get me to. He said I should start with women's soccer because the female US team hasn't placed lower than third since they started in 1991. agent_1:Despite the US not being as supportive of soccer as other sports, the us teams have done amazingly well in the world cups as you mentioned agent_2:Yeah, but i think Americans are getting tired of some of the US only sports. Soccer makes more money than football, basketball, baseball and golf combined. agent_1:That is because soccer is the most popular internationally agent_2:I asked my boyfriend why it's called soccer here and he said it was slang for association football in the states. agent_1:Honestly, football and american football confused the heck out of me when I was younger. Calling it soccer made it easier agent_2:Maybe they should just call American football :stupid ball"" and get it over with. I heard the city set to host the fifa in 2022 doesn't even exist yet. agent_1:True many countries want to host despite no immediate economic benefits agent_2:That's really surprising, I heard there are no disceernable economic benefits to host the Olympics either. I guess the whole process is so taxing to the economy and people. agent_1:Perhaps but it also provides prestige, advertisement, tourism, and jobs so I guess it is worth it agent_2:I like that some of the players are altruistic at least, even if sports is mostly about money. I heard a German player donated his 300,000 FIFA win money to help kids in Brazil get surgery. agent_1:That is very generous of him agent_2:I heard Jon Stewart was a footballer as well."	agent_1:I hope soccer continues to maintain such a healthy spirit despite allegations of corruption surrounding the league	agent_2 likes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'world cup', 'sports'].
12468	agent_1:Did You know that humans may have lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago ? agent_2:I think that fact is misleading. After all, we still have plenty of body hair today. I think it would be more accurate to say humans lost their fur (a consistent/extensive hair covering) within the last 240,000 years ago. agent_1:wow ;) we had fur ? ;) agent_2:What do you think animal hair is? That's why I find wearing actual animal fur so disgusting. I wouldn't wear the skin and hair of another human. Why would I want to wear the skin of an animal? agent_1:no, what I meant was - did WE - humans had fur in the past ? agent_2:Well, yes. Technically we still have fur today (although it is spotty). Fur is the covering of hair used to protect an animal and help it control its temperature and reactions to the climate. agent_1:ok... I've never thought about it this way... agent_2:I think once you adjust your mindset and realize how close we are to modern-day animals, you begin to change how you think of the animals themselves. agent_1:We are modern days animals ? how so... we just sit all day and look at the monitor :)	agent_2:We're not just modern-day animals.

Do you know when the first one was released? agent_1:Yeah that was back on 2007, seems so long ago now agent_2:I know it sure does. Among users, women are more likely to own one than men agent_1:Oh cool fact. Microsoft in fact held a funeral to mark the death of the iPhone when they launched theirs agent_2:Wow that did not work very well because the iPhone has had tremendous sales agent_1:Exactly. Have you heard of the game send me to heaven? agent_2:I did, and Apple banned it because people were supposed to throw the phones as high as possible and risked damaging them  agent_1:That is so stupid. When Steve Jobs presented it first he has identical ones hidden because they kept crashing agent_2:Yeah it kept running our of ram and that is why it crashed. Those days are over though agent_1:They sure are. Do you listen to the radio much? agent_2:Yes I listen to Pandora Radio. How about you? agent_1:Yes me too. Their net income is $-16 million and the revenue is $274 million agent_2:Wow that is so strange. Now they are streaming stand up comedy. agent_1:That is nice they are diversifying their stream. When Swift removed her music from iTunes she still kept it in Pandora agent_2:Maybe that means more of her fans moving over to Pandora, so that is good revenue right there agent_1:Yeah that is true.

By the time they're 15, cats have spent about 10 years of their lives sleeping agent_1:Sorry, to hear that.  I have had a cat, she passed away last year and she was 18 years old.  I believe she probably slept 16 out of those 18 years sleeping. lol agent_2:I didn't realize that they sleep so much or that there are over 70 breeds! agent_1:My cat was probably the easiest low maintenance pet I ever had,  A lot less needy than my dogs, for sure. Do own any pets? agent_2:The only pet I've ever had are fish, though I don't mind cats. I had a friend in college who wants to open her own cat cafe like they have in Japan and Taiwan agent_1:Yeah, I heard about those cafes.  People pay to have a drink and play with cats.  Sounds like an easy way to make money! agent_2:I'm not sure how easy that would be with all the food safety laws we have here in the US. Maybe that's why it hasn't become popular here.  agent_1:That's true.  Did you know that dogs have 12 different blood types and can donate at blood drives?	agent_2:I wonder if their blood types work similarly to ours?

I even knew the married couple who scheduled all 2000+ games every year agent_1:I didnt know about them, I guessed they had a talent for that, can you imagine the time that would take! agent_2:Yes it was a lot of work.  I just wish my grandfather had saved baseball cards - one lucky man found 3 million dollars worth of them in his grandfather's attic agent_1:3 million dolars no kidding! that is awesome, what a lucky break he had, agent_2:For sure.  Wonder if baseball cards exist in Japan?  The game is really popular there as well agent_1:I bet they due, they really love the sport our there, do you have a favorite baseball team?  I like the Yankees agent_2:I am an Atlanta Braves fan but I could not help but love the Cubs when they finally won the World Series a few years ago agent_1:Yeah I bet they were really exited, they could lift that curse finally agent_2:Yes they won back to back world series and then never won again for years agent_1:Babe Ruth was caught stealing a base and then his team lost back in the year 1926 agent_2:Yeah talk about blowing the world series for your team - in game 7 even!	agent_1:I know right, he still was considered a legend, things could have turn out differently if he didnt had the guts to steal that base	agent_2 likes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'game 7', 'favorite team'].

10517	agent_1:Its crazy how Google and Amazon have grown agent_2:It's hard to even believe Google has been around for over twenty years. agent_1:I know right, seems like its been around forever agent_2:And Amazon has been around even longer, since 1994. agent_1:Its a long time, Amazon started as an online bookstore right? agent_2:Yes, but now it's largest Internet retailer in the world! agent_1:It is, it sells everything from books to groceries to pet supplies you name it, I love the company agent_2:It also sells low-end and affordable products under its own brand called AmazonBasics. agent_1:Have you tried the Amazon Basics products? agent_2:Sure. I used Amazon for practically everything, but I also used Google. I guess I'm not alone because when Google went down for about five minutes in 2013, 40% of the web traffic went down with it. agent_1:I love Google as well, you know it was founded by two PHD students in Standford University agent_2:Yeah, and together they own 14 percent of the company, and control about 56% of the stockholder voting power. agent_1:I thought they owned a bigger percentage of the company, I heard the company wants to reoganize some of its interests in a company called Alphabet Inc agent_2:Yes, they actually announced that several years ago. Most recently, Larry Page was removed as the CEO of Google and is now the CEO of Alphabet. agent_1:A guess that makes sense, Google is a big company and it must have more than one CEO for different divisions, have you ever used the Maps app? agent_2:Yeah, it's interesting how they determine the borders of countries with disputed borders. agent_1:I agree, interesting and they also calculate traffic using android devices that are in movement on the road, thats just genius and bit invasive agent_2:Definitely, though everything is invasive these days, so what are you going to do? Did you know it takes more computing power for a Google search than it did for Neil Armstrong to go to the moon?

I want to keep seeing more and more voter turnout. It hasn't been more than 62.8 percent in 100 years agent_2:the vote should be mandatory. then people would see the power of the ballot. agent_1:I agree, I am sure other countries do that.

Do you? agent_1:I love Disney as well, one of my favorite movies Big Hero 6,  agent_2:Nice!  I have so many,  little mermaid, aladdin,  lion king, inside out,  wreck it ralph,  incredibles, frozen, moana. agent_1:Those are awesome movies as well, interesting fact about Big Hero 6, the movie was made with a super computer, 55000 cores agent_2:wow!  Thats amazing.  I like the city it is based in, san fransokyo lol  agent_1:I like it too, a lot of creativity in the movie, another interesting fact is that minnie mouse is short for minerva mouse agent_2:I guess that makes sense!

I'm wondering is it only Japan, but any Asian country as well.  agent_1:Interesting, do you know if they play a championship game there? And if so, what is it called?>  agent_2:I have no idea. But if so, why US teams don't play aganst Japanese? lol It could the World Cup like in soccer/footaball every January 4 teams from different continents play  agent_1:I don't know, curious why we call it a world series but the two countries never play each other.  agent_2:Absolutely. Have you read an article about Chicago Cubs recently? agent_1:No, I didn't see it.

Speaking of movies, Black Panther has the richest superhero out there, worth $500 billion! agent_2:That's a lot of money. They are re-releasing th emovie for free from February 1 - 7 for african american month... agent_1:Wow!! Thats amzinzing. I know there was a lot of confusion when the movie was first released...many people confused it with the black panther party.  agent_2:Yeah, they are a lot different. T'challa is the richest superhero/ agent_1:That's interesting! You know, there's a lot that we can do with this extra day off with the cold and all...we have the whole day to indulge. Did you know that when the Earth was first formed, a day was only 5.5 hours long? agent_2:I had no idea. I do know that I am working on this cold day and worked out this morning. It has been a cold day! agent_1:Yes it has. The weather and the earth's atmosphere is forever changing. By the 21st century, we anticipate running out of Helium. That's going to significantly impact human life...scary!! agent_2:How is it going to impact humans> I am curious to know more! agent_1:Well, for one, Helium makes up a large portion of our atmosphere. I do know that. And Helium helps to keep things floating so I can only imagine the impact will be negative! agent_2:Thanks for the insight. I had no idea! agent_1:I'm just thinking about how our atmosphere works... I', no expert but I think its safe to say that the absence of Helium could come at a high cost. agent_2:I agree. I had no idea that it was that precious. agent_1:Yessss!! I guess we could gain more insight about what the future holds for humanity by reading the bible.

Interesting stuff. agent_1:Never heard that one before, lol! There is a fish called the black swallower that is capable of eating prey twice its length and 10 times its own weight. agent_2:I knew one of those in my fraternity in college I think. I was shocked to learn there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal. Only creature on earth that can claim that here on the planet. agent_1:Yeah we all know that guy! how about the loch ness monster being protected under the Scottish 1912 protection of animals act. Creatures of the great deep are extraordinary. ""The immortal Jelly fish.  agent_2:I already looked up that jellyfish on my phone. Fascinating, yes loch ness is protected and pets in Boulder, Colorado are not owned, but guarded. Interesting how different cultures handle that. agent_1:Tell me about it apparently there are more U.S. Tigers living as pets than there are living in the wild in Asia. agent_2:Yes, that is sad in some ways too. Happy we're keeping them alive, probably in zoo but going extinct in the wild is a sad statement on the planet today. agent_1:I agree. Germany became the first country to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed rights.   agent_2:While I'm a pet owner, that going a bit far. Do you give dogs and cats rights, how about those dairy cows or cattle to be eaten. Do they get lesser rights? agent_1:Very good point. My wife and I are watching Blue Planet. It's shocking some of the things that are down in the deep. they are still making discoveries every single day. Apparently the sea horse is the only fish with a neck.  agent_2:Yes, and really they say we know more about the face of the moon than the bottom of the ocean. Who knows what's down there we don't know?  Maybe the Loch Ness monster's cousin. agent_1:If you ever get a chance you should check this show, there's some amazing creatures down there. 84% of genes that are associated with diseases have counterparts in the Zebrafish.  agent_2:I read that and thought the same. I wonder how similar the Zebra Fish is to humans? Can we use that in medical research? agent_1:If we can i'm sure it will be preventative or medication. There's no money in cures. I didn't realize that we had already cloned a cat and named it Copy Cat, that's too funny."	agent_2:Yes, the scientist in that experiment had a sense of humor.

I have watched him a few times in interviews. agent_2:Yeah he's very entertaining and interviews I think. It is crazy to me though that the Tesla Model S is so safe that somehow it broke the safety testing equipment, I don't know how that's possible LOL agent_1:Really, I agree, How does that happen? Saw where he took a  $78 million pay cut in 2014. agent_2:Yeah that is impressive. It's also impressive that Tesla releases their patents in order to encourage competition, I definitely would not do that if I owned the company haha agent_1:Most people wouldn't, wonder why? To help the environment? Who knows he probably got something else better lined up! agent_2:Yeah I agree. It's crazy though that they named themselves after Nikola Tesla, but they're not the only company that was named after him! There is another car company called just Nicola apparently agent_1:Interesting, I owned an electric car for 3 years, it was an easy car to drive. My husband named it the phantom! He could never here when I got home. lol agent_2:Haha well that is one benefit of the electric-car then! On a different note though, what do you think about Fox News? Apparently they broadcasting over 86 countries around the world agent_1:About the only one I watch these days! I didn't know Richard Nixon was one of the creators!  agent_2:Yeah I didn't know that either! I also didn't know that they were going to sue The Simpsons because they kept parodying them, I thought that fox owns The Simpsons? agent_1:I did too! Didn't know they were going to create a cable channel  just for The Simpsons! Do you watch that show? agent_2:I liked to watch The Simpsons yes, back to fox news though it's interesting that their median viewer age is 68, that seems old agent_1:Yes, That's strange, find that hard to believe. I do believe Fox news is watched more than CNN and MSNBC combined. agent_2:Yes I think you're right. It's also interesting that Fox News has only 55% of its time dedicated to opinion pieces while on MSNBC at 85% of the time, they definitely have a better percentage on Fox News in my opinion agent_1:I think so.Do you like Dance? I love to watch babies dance to music, adorable!! agent_2:Yes I agree with you! I also think it's funny that the girl from Game of Thrones did the robot dance and also the Funky Chicken during her audition LOL I wish I could see that tape agent_1:Ha, ha, ha,I can imagine that! I'm not surprised MJ used a device for the lean dance move? Wasn't that in the song  Smooth Criminal? agent_2:Yes I think so. I'm also shocked that he has a patent on that device. It's crazy though that the moonwalk was first performed in1955 so it's actually an old dance move agent_1:Really, didn't know that? 1955, they had all kind of different moves then.

The Republican party is old school so it fits very nicely! agent_1:There have been a total of 19 Republican presidents...the most of any party! agent_2:Wow, I didn't know that. Yes, the Republicans dominated politics nationally between 1860 and 1932!  agent_1:They always emphasize their abortion position, which all stemmed from the monumental Roe vs Wade 1973 Supreme Court Ruling.	agent_2:Exactly.

We gotta start looking for some tall people to run in 2020 agent_2:lol, Using the lottery to appoint leaders is scary like they did in ancient Athens!  agent_1:Very true.  I wouldnt just want any random politician in charge. agent_2:True, They thought it would lead to oligarchy. agent_1:It could have.  I think we need what Nevada has, a none of these candidates option on the ballot. agent_2:I was thinking the same thing! Why are they the only state? All states should have that. agent_1:It would really let the government know what the people are thinking. agent_2:I agree, I'm surprised its only republican presidents that have had beards! agent_1:Yeah, there havent been that many at that either. agent_2:Two, lol Its funny they have a candy desk at the senate filled with chocolate bars and jellybeans! agent_1:Id be claiming that as my desk!

I guess theres a lot more to earth than what meets the eye, im just glad 71% of earth is water, I love water, the sea, rivers agent_2:I love water regions too, especially the ocean. You could fit all the planets between the moon and the earth and still have room. agent_1:Amazing and it looks so close you raise your arm and try to touch it, days at earth when it first got formed were only 5.5 hours long agent_2:Thats pretty short. And I thought they were too short in the winter! Do you like to read? agent_1:I do like to read yeah, what about you? agent_2:Yeah.

There's a doctor that teaches heavy metal as a form of literature.  agent_1:Wow interesting, do you know who Winston Churchill is? well he won a novel prize because of literature. agent_2:Yeah, he's very talented. The father of modern olympics won a gold medal in literature for writing a poem about sports.  agent_1:Thats interesting, literature, music, painting used to be events in the Olympic games.  agent_2:I can't imagine what olympic painting was like!

I've never watched the show, but I wonder if it gives you tips on what to do in case of an invasion? I understand there are some firefighters that are trained to treat aliens. agent_1:I used to watch the show. Pretty weird that Tom Cruise has a $10 million underground bunker to protect himself from aliens.  agent_2:It is curious. I mean, since the leader of his religion is an alien, as I understand it, you'd think he'd be okey doke with aliens. agent_1:Crazy, what religion is he?  agent_2:Scientology. It's a mix of sci-fi and self help, with a nice dose of pyramid scheme added in.  agent_1:Oh yeah, I've seen shows on that. That is crazy. I wonder if they could make a franchise out of that similar to the Alien's movie franchise.  agent_2:With aliens from the deep? I'd love that. Of course, the Scientology aliens come from volcanoes, which is a whole other...thing. agent_1:That would be a pretty cool movie. They could even have a cameo from Bill Nye the science guy! agent_2:Aw, he's the best! He's the executive director of the Planetary Society! I love astronomy. agent_1:I used to watch his show a lot. Did you know that the Ancient babylonians had a sophisticated understanding of astronomy? "	agent_2:I'm not surprised. Once you observe the sky regularly, you start to see where everything is.

I didn't know Tom Hanks had a brother that does his voice on video games and merchandise... agent_1:Jimmy Hanks!  I think I have heard about that before, good call! agent_2:I guess ya gotta help out your bro.  Video games were once called ""cathode ray tube amusement devices"" by the military...

The Curiosity sings happy birthday to itself on its birthday. agent_1:haha they are cute! did you ever watch Mythbusters? I guess they created a robot sidekick on that show	agent_2:I do watch that sometimes but have not seen that episode. I guess the idea of chess playing robots have been around for awhile.

Would you believe it if I told you that the Chicago Cubs last won a World Series when the Ottoman Empire was still in existence? agent_1:am... no, I don't think I would believe that... ;) was that in Wikipedia ? ;) lol agent_2:Maybe a saved version of wikipedia.  I won't soon forget when the Cubs really did win, back in 2016, over my Indians. agent_1:Your ? ;)  at that time You were cheering for Indians ? agent_2:Yes.  I'm not the owner of the team ;) ... they're just from my hometown. agent_1:Although I'm Polish - I got that ;) lol. How are they doing these days ? agent_2:Pretty good, on top of their division last year, but no where as good as the Red Sox.  They had an amazing start to the year, and then they won the World Series. agent_1:Holy crap, nice. Probably fat bonuses for everybody... but hey... if they made their fans happy, why the heck not... they earned it ! agent_2:They did.  It was almost too easy.  They have great pitchers, good hitters, and a new manager.  Normally, a new manager isn't a help, but he was from the team who won the World Series the year before, The Houston Astros. agent_1:Huh... do You think he knows a secret for winning World Series ? ;)  idk... I think it's just a well paid team ;) agent_2:Money and chemistry build winning teams, if you ask me.  Baseball is popular in the US, Japan, and a few other places.  Is it played much in Poland? agent_1:Not really, but we do buy baseball bats :) to go watch soccer games on a stadium :) agent_2:You buy bats?  Why?  I used to collect baseball cards, which can be quite valuable! agent_1:well... when one soccer team meets other soccer team and those two towns/teams are not friendly... You need to take whatever You can smuggle to the stadium to fight off the hooligans from the other team ;) lol - baseball bats are selling good in Poland but nobody plays the game ;) lol	agent_2:ah ... that's a little scary.  I suppose without a baseball bat, my simple weapon of choice would be  ...  something else I can't think of.  Fascinating.  I do like soccer.  I'm a Croat (half really), so the World Cup was exciting this year.

Im not a big rollercoaster fan. agent_1:Same here.  My son loves Cedar Point in Ohio, we take him and he goes on all the big rides while I sit and watch.  I guess everyone seeks their own entertainment. agent_2:Yeah I went on a roller coaster when i was little that did a flip. Then it went backwards and did the flip again. I have hated them ever sense.  agent_1:I think I'll stick to the movies.  Have you ever seen the movie Moon?  It's about ten years old now, it was made by David Bowie's son Duncan Jones. agent_2:No I havent seen it is it good. agent_1:It's interesting in a small movie way.  Clever story with a nice twist at the end.   agent_2:Ill have to check it out. One of the earliest movies I an remember seeing is ET. My mom liked it when I was a kid.  agent_1:I remember that one when I was at school, I had to wait until it was on VHS.  I also recall be scared by Close Encounters, it took me nearly ten years to watch it. agent_2:I wasnt one for scary movies either. My sister loved them even when she was a little kid. Did yo ever see Schindlers list.We watched that one in school.  agent_1:Yes, I remember going with my dad.  It almost felt like we had to go.  It's amazing how a movie maker can go from big popcorn movies like E.T. to a serious movie such as Schindler's List.	agent_2:Yeah that movie was deep. I took an elective class in high school on the holocaust and we watched it. That was a screwed up time in history. Man the way they lined p the Jews and shot them in rows to save bullets. That always sticks out to me as a prime example of how sick and screwed up the Germans were at that time.

He probably didnt realize what was happening.  They should have brought out Eeyore instead. agent_1:I know right Dumbo didnt have the fault lol, I bet he isnt a Republican either, agent_2:Probably not.  He might wear blue for all we know. agent_1:So the red and blue colors, seem like they have been around forever but its a recent thing from the year 2000 agent_2:That is surprising!  I feel like they have always been there as far back as I can remember. agent_1:It sure seems like a lot longer, so elections are really important Im just glad we have that choice many countries dont agent_2:Very true, which is why it is surprising election turnout hasnt gotten above 63% agent_1:And thats how we end up with leaders like Trump lol, also the taller candidate wins 75% of the time, interesting stat agent_2:So we need to find someone taller than him for 2020.  Lets start searching now. lol agent_1:We sure do lol, did you know Nevada is the only state with the option ''None of these'' agent_2:They have that?  Ok... im kinda jealous now. agent_1:They do, seems like the best option at times lol agent_2:It really does.   agent_1:I think one of the best governors is Schwarzenegger would be cool to have the terminator as president one day	agent_2:It really would1	agent_1 likes TV show. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV show', 'sports', 'unknown'].

The universe is certainly fascinating. agent_2:It is indeed, have you ever observed Mars in the sky ? NASA wants to send people there in 20-25 years.  agent_1:I have a few times, but never by telescope or anything like that.  I have heard that a colonization project was planned for 2023 and was going to be funded by making some sort of reality show.  That would be a fun one to watch. agent_2:There is a few contests about the colonization of Mars, NASA has also one, you have to submit a concept for  a house on Mars.  agent_1:the 3.15 million dollar prize would be a nice one to win for that.  I would love to see humans make it to mars in my life time.  I wonder if the first country there would try to claim it as their territory. agent_2:I don't think they will claim to Mars, it will be more like the Moon, even Antarctica does not belong to a country.   agent_1:True.  It is also crazy that a satellite was lost on Mars because Locheed Martin used the imperial system but NASA used metric.  How could they not get that detail in order?	agent_2:Locheed is a big company based in the US.

Looks like Istanbul even has vending machines to release food and water for strays. agent_1:that is a great point! The US needs to get those vending machines, I would donate so many plastic bottles. That is nice of that country agent_2:I wonder where else the dogs go if not for vencing machines? agent_1:right, they probably go for trash cans unfortunately.

Maryland's governor, Larry Hogan, is a republican who was under some hot water for policies on climate change. agent_2:Thats interesting.  the beatles song""come together"" was written for 1969 governor campaign. agent_1:Larry Hogan could probably have used the support of a group like the Beatles, but I'm sure he will be ok.  At least he isn't as bad as North Dakota's in 1934 who actually seceded from the US for a short time! agent_2:when schwarzenegger became governor of ca he commuted 3 hours everyday lol  agent_1:Maybe so he could leave the office every day and say ""I'll be back!""   agent_2:haha good one!    agent_1:Did you hear that Texas had a female governor before other states even allowed women to vote? agent_2:Yeah thats really interesting. did you know there hasnt been a us president who wasnt a rep or dem since 1853? agent_1:Wow!  We truly are a two party system, but don't try getting elected as president as a democrat with a beard.  So far all bearded presidents have been republican. agent_2:Im not excited about that,  I will never be president lol  agent_1:It's crazy to think that red/blue connotations for the parties isn't even 20 years old.   agent_2:Yeah it seems like that was always the case,  but I guess not.   agent_1:The Bush's had a heck of a run with three terms.  In fact, before Trump, you'd have to go back to 1928 to find an elected republican that didn't have nixon or a bush."	agent_2:Thats interesting,  do you know much about our planets?

I didn't know Tom Hanks had a brother that does his voice on video games and merchandise... agent_1:Jimmy Hanks!  I think I have heard about that before, good call! agent_2:I guess ya gotta help out your bro.  Video games were once called ""cathode ray tube amusement devices"" by the military... Yawn... agent_1:Yeah I don't think they imagined there would be multimillion dollar stadiums built for them.  agent_2:What was the military even doing with them?  Did you know that Venus doesn't tilt so it has no seasons? agent_1:That is interesting, I think it is the only planet that rotates clock-wise as well.  agent_2:For really weird rotation, Uranus actually rotates sideways and seems to ""roll"" around the sun.  agent_1:Thats crazy, I wonder what earth would be like if we weren't spinning around, and we were rolling like uranus lol.  agent_2:I guess we'd have really burned and cold poles.  Jupiter has a moon. Ganymede, that's more than big enough to be a planet if it were rotating the Sun. agent_1:Very interesting.  I guess there is a planet out there that has crazy winds of glass that blow at 4500 mph! agent_2:Wow, that would require a bit more than an umbrella... I guess signs of life have been detected on a planetary system 455 light-years away.  Very far, far away... agent_1:That doesn't seem too far away in the whole of space, very interesting, I wonder what our technology will reveal in the next 10 years or so.  agent_2:It's small condiering the universe and very far for Earthlings.

The Marvel cinematic universe takes place in earth -199999, a multiverse different from the original comic book multiverse, earth-616! agent_1:That's pretty wild.

Ballet dancers go through tons of shoes, 4 pairs a week agent_1:Yeah must cost a lot too. Babies are good at dancing too when they hear music agent_2:Yeah and they smile more once they hit the beat, smart agent_1:Yes super sweet.

Did you know that baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically eligible to play if they need to? agent_2:I wouldn't have guessed that. I always thought of the managers as those out of shape guys who yelled at the players.  agent_1:Me too. Did you know that baseball is hugely popular in Japan? agent_2:That I did know. They have some great teams over there. I think they were surprised at how popular it is in america as well.  agent_1:Yes they are which is so strange to me. Did you hear about the guy who found baseball cards in his grandfather's attic? agent_2:Weren't they worth a few million dollars? Could you imagine finding something like that!? agent_1:Yes they were. 3 million to be exact. That would be amazing! agent_2:I wonder if there were a lot of Yankee cards in there. They seem to be the powerhouse team of baseball.  agent_1:They do. Speaking of, in 1973 two Yankees pitchers swapped families permanently!  agent_2:Um how would that even work? Like they married each others wives and raised the others kids? So strange! agent_1:I guess. I have no idea why they would do that. Bill O'Reilly made up a fake press organization to get Yankee's season tickets while he was in college.  agent_2:Given the price of yankee tickets that is one way to get in I guess. I wonder if that started his love of news as a career.  agent_1:That's a good question but I also can't believe it worked. Did you know that until their recent win the last time the Cubs won a World Series the Ottoman Empire still existed?!	agent_2:Makes sense.

11101	"agent_1:How does America make collective decisions.  By voting.   agent_2:Do you know the difference between the United States Senate and House of Representatives? agent_1:One difference is 2 per state for the Senate while the House has 435 districts.  Those who are elected call the people who are represented ""constituents"" agent_2:Yes, and the Senate is considered more prestigious  and more deliberative. They're both important in for presidential votes, I think. agent_1:Yes.   The senate has certain rules where 60 votes are required for many bills.  I think that forces more deliberatioin.  They used the same gavel for 155 years until Richard Nixon cracked it. agent_2:The only fun think I've learned about the Senate is that they started the candy desk tradition. I remember my teachers always had candy drawers in their desks. agent_1:I have one in my office too.  One needs supplements if your blood sugar drops for no good reason.  Apparently Pennsylvania is the source of the candy right now. agent_2:Was that because of the Hershey factory there? Did you know they let astronauts vote from outer space? I think that's a good thing. agent_1:The astronaut voting sends a strong message about how important voting is.  I like that too.  For some reason, the candies are Mars bars and Milky Way rather than Hershey. agent_2:I'd think they'd have expensive candies from local shops. I wonder why the Senate used to have a rule that women were not allowed to wear pants until after 1993? agent_1:I suspect that women set the dress code in years past so they would look professional. Michael Jordan would not endorse a democrat because ""republicans buy shoes too"" agent_2:I heard that about Jordan but I really didn't understand what he meant. I also don't understand why Republicans started out with ideals more like Democrats today and then switched.  agent_1:Jordan has his own line of shoes made by Nike.  It is a separate brand and he does not want to offend almost half of the market.  But the GOP has always been small government and low regulations. agent_2:I get it now! Well, Jordan was smart for that as far as business goes, it seems. It's also interesting to me how the Republicans are associated with red and Democrats with blue."	agent_1:Yes.

8731	agent_1:Do you have children? agent_2:No I do not, how about you? agent_1:I do and he seems to be hitting puberty. Moody tween all the time. agent_2:Ah I assume that is causing some difficultly. Is there anything in particular he is stubborn on?  agent_1:He is a great kid, until he plays Fortnite. Something about that game gets him all jacked up and he acts like a different kid. agent_2:There have been a lot of studies on video games and it's effect on children. The consensus always seems to be that they use it as an outlet.  agent_1:I think listening to the way the other people talk and act affects him. He's usually mild and polite, but when he plays with them, he gets very hyper and surly. I also think it's the change in hormones. agent_2:That could very well be the case. Hormones seem to do something to susceptibility, at least it was for me as a teen.  agent_1:He's also at the awkward, trying to figure out who he is, stage. It's fun to really watch his personality develop. agent_2:It's such a weird place to be in the world. They are starting to take on more adult responsibilities but at the same time are still kids in a lot of ways.  agent_1:Right! He is such a little kid about some things, but he's starting to look at girls differently and it's a weird situation to be in. He used to tell me everything, but not so much anymore. agent_2:Wanting to have some secrets its about right developmentally speaking. Just feeling out some small forms of independence.  agent_1:His voice has also started to change. He is taking after his father with a super low, bass filled voice. It's crazy to hear that low deep voice come out of a kid! I'm wondering what else we are going to be in store for as he changes? agent_2:Has he already been through the outgrowing every bit of clothing stage?  agent_1:He's growing like he's getting paid for it! Every weekend we are going through his clothes and getting rid of what is too small! Especially pants and long sleeve shirts, he has long legs and arms. agent_2:Ugh, that has got to be the worst. Even with standard clothing it's got to be expensive and then occasions come up where you need things like suits and you know odds are they are only going to wear it once.  agent_1:We are sticking with a lot of khaki pants and nice dress shirts. If he has to have a suit, we'll have to buy it a couple of days before the event, there's no other way to deal with it. agent_2:That is a really smart plan. Forget even trying to tailor it, it will never be worth the cost and time. agent_1:I agree totally, tailoring is not worth it at all. I've been lucky with consignments and things so far, but the more he grows and the older he gets, I can't do that as much anymore. I just hope that puberty won't be terribly long as far as the growing is concerned.	agent_2:I know thrift store typically had a lot of nicer things for women but you're right the men's selections seems to be lacking.

Is it the Cubs? They were the first team to win back to back World Series. agent_1:No, I am a fan of the Brewers, I have never seen them play in a series, one game away.   agent_2:What was the longest at bat you've ever seen? There is some question as to what the longest at bat ever was. agent_1:I don't know probably only 20 pitches or so, but I figure the longest is pretty darn long.  Did you know managers can technically play if needed? agent_2:I didn't know that, but it makes sense. Also, apparently the longest at bat ever was 21 pitches.  agent_1:That is all, that doesn't seem like very many considering a full count is minimal 5 pitches.   agent_2:Well, apparently there is some dispute. The 'story' doesn't match any game on record, but the story has been told for over 70 years. agent_1:Yeah and I guess the records began being kept in 1988, so who knows what it was before that.  agent_2:Yeah, I guess 1998 is considered the modern era. Before that teams didn't watch stats too closely. agent_1:That is crazy, that doesn't see that long ago.  I'm sure there are all kinds of crazy records before then.  agent_2:Cy Young apparently won 435 games, now 200 is considered incredible.  agent_1:Holy cow that is a crazy amount of baseball games to win, not just start, but win.  agent_2:I can see why they named the yearly pitching trophy after him. agent_1:Yeah I agree with you on that. Did you know that kickball is also called soccer-baseball up in Canada? agent_2:I didn't know that. Did you by chance read about that in the library which is a collection of information sources? agent_1:Yeah isn't that pretty funny?  I read that in some random facts I saw online.   agent_2:Ha, I like random facts.

I find it funny that Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Greek mythology. agent_1:That is sort of odd.  There is even a wiki that ranks fictional characters by their powers, that would be an interesting read. agent_2:And in Greek literature there wasn't much kissing. Romantic kissing is actually a recent development. agent_1:That surprises me, I  guess I always associated it with all love stories.  Even Shakespeare. agent_2:Yeah I think there was a lot of romance just kissing wasn't part of it. agent_1:I see.  Winston Churchill won a Nobel Prize, for literature.  I always though it was for peace agent_2:Interesting! Literature was an olympic event from 1912 to 1952. I always associate the olympics with sports! agent_1:Same here, I always thought it was part of the ancient games but never made its way to the modern games.  How do you even judge that? agent_2:Yeah, pretty subjective. Speaking of literature contests, there isone that challenges writers to come up with the worst opening sentence for a novel. agent_1:I heard there was, I wonder what the winners were, those would be fun to read. agent_2:Do you think that literature should be censored? agent_1:Absolutely not!  That is why I hated to hear that the FDA burned 6 tons of literature agent_2:But should fan fiction be allowed? George RR Martin says it is copyright infringement and isn't useful for aspiring writers. agent_1:i think so.  I think it is a great creative outlet for pepole. agent_2:Have you heard of Tommy Orange's debut novel, There There? agent_1:i havenr, whats is it like? agent_2:It is about Native Americans in modern history but seems to also touch on how they were treated in the past. It's a fictional story with elements of truth. agent_1:I think that might be an interesting read.	agent_2:The story follows around different members of a large cast of Native Americans who live in Oakland, CA.

Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer as well as kung fu star and won the Hong Kong Cha-Cha championship in 1958. agent_1:That's cool,never would have pictured him doing the Cha Cha but it takes the same skills probably to perform Kung Fu. agent_2:Other stars you would not expect, Tupac danced ballet and was the Mouse King in his high school production of the Nutcracker. agent_1:Wow, Tupac?  You must be pulling my leg!  Never could he be a ballet dancer.  Wow! agent_2:I know but creative people are drawn to the arts. Just like how babies are drawn to music. They will spontaneously dance when they hear music and smile when they hit the beat. agent_1:Speaking of ballet, did you know that ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week? agent_2:That is a lot of shoes. They must need it for all the extreme moves they perform.

I remember watching the HBO special of his Madison Square Garden show.  Are you a fan? agent_1:No, I'm not.  I don't dislike him however... I guess people aren't quite buying his re-branding.  One said, ""all the flannel in the world couldn't warm critical reception to the tour."" agent_2:Haha, that is a great line.  I think he became a lot more personable after marrying Jessica Biel.  He has definitely come a long way from Nipplegate. agent_1:Ha.  He seems to be more effect.  Many think he should stick to his hits and not try to change too much.  agent_2:I have heard some call his new tour empty, but that ""many people enjoy empty fun.""  Sounds poignant, but also a shot at society! agent_1:I think the detractors mainly don't like the theme and think he should do shows as he has always done. agent_2:Yes, people love the old stuff in general.  One of the best-selling albums of 2014 was Dark Side of the Moon.  Over 40 years after being initially released! agent_1:Yes, it's a classic.  Pink Floyd is different.  They turned a houseboat into a floating recording studio on the river Thames. agent_2:Haha, yup they are awesome.  I was a being fan of Linkin Park.  Very sad to hear what happened to them after having one of the best selling album's of the 21st century. agent_1:What happened to them?  I know ""Hybrid Theory"" was the album of which you speak.  agent_2:*Big fan I meant.  The lead singer passed away recently. agent_1:Oh, sorry to hear that.  On a lighter note, two identical twins in Japan released a rap album when they turned 100 in 1992. agent_2:That is remarkable!  Sounds about as wild as the president of Indonesia releasing 3 pop albums while in office! agent_1:Yes, as wild as scientist voting the song ""We are the Champions"" as the catchiest song of all time.  I miss Freddy... agent_2:Me too :(  Those were the good old days.  When Eddie Van Halen literally set fire to the speakers when recording ""Beat It."" agent_1:His amp must have gone to ""11"" like in the movie Spinal Tap.  Funny, Ricky Gervals was a pop singer in the 1980's.  agent_2:I cannot picture that!  They all have interesting quirks.  LIke Brian May using coins instead of guitar picks. agent_1:Or Matthew Bellamy from Muse destroying so many guitars.  Sad, he should donate them to a good cause.  That's been done, move on... agent_2:I agree.  He actually owns the Guinness world record for most guitars smashed!  Not ideal! agent_1:I agree.  Do something unique at least.

So cold! agent_1:Wow!! Its definitely a good day to stay in and catch some movies. Speaking of movies, Black Panther has the richest superhero out there, worth $500 billion!	agent_2:That's a lot of money.

I can't seem to wrap my head around it... can You ? agent_2:i did not, that would be pretty wild, they should make a commercial about that agent_1:They should make a National Geographic special ! lol, even then I don't know if I would understand that...  agent_2:they should! i like the theory that there is one electron in the universe! agent_1:ugh... another one... I'm Polish man... cut me some slack here :) agent_2:I am sorry? agent_1:I am too... :) I'm saying it's another subject I don't understand ;) one electron ? What does that mean ? I thought there are billions of them... agent_2:i thought so as well, maybe the theory is we are all super small? agent_1:Hey ;) there is nothing small about me man ;) lol	agent_2:I got you haha. what do you think abuot celebrities? judge judy makes 123,000 per episode apparently!	agent_1 likes TV. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV', 'National Geographic', 'superhologram'].

11780	agent_1:Are you a Lady Gaga fan? agent_2:Yes, musically and as an actress. I just heard a new extended version of a star is born is coming out. I can't wait to see the extra footage. agent_1:I have not seen it at all but I am interested. It got a lot of acclaim. Do you know that Lady Gaga is the godmother of Elton John's son? agent_2:Yes, shes tweeted about him a lot. You should follow her on twitter she has well over 11 million followers and posts all kinds of neat stuff. agent_1:I just recently followed her so I missed a lot. Speaking of, did you also know that the LAPD asked her to tweet her followers about some upcoming roadwork? agent_2:I guess they have a lot less followers. Smart idea! She's come a long way since she was on boiling points. agent_1:I forgot that show existed. I had no idea she was on that. I'm sure she's a bit embarrassed about that now.  agent_2:Maybe, you know it's funny I love her music but she's not really what I'd consider typical to what I listen to. Then I find out her favorite band is Iron Maiden and it makes sense. agent_1:I didn't know about that either. I usually prefer rock as well but I'm not against some catchy pop here and there to get my day going or to work out to. It has it's place for sure.  agent_2:I just wish she'd tour more. I have seen a few of her concerts but there are not that many opportunties. agent_1:You would think she would since that's a lot of the income for singers now. Do you enjoy going to concerts? agent_2:Yes, how about you? I think Linkin Park is the band I've seen the most. They play a lot of shows. Or at least they did :( Sadly there will be no more. agent_1:I used to like it a lot but I don't enjoy the crowds quite as much anymore. I did hear that Linkin Park played 324 concerts in one year. That's insane! agent_2:Yeah I'm really going to miss Chester. They played some really great venues, I wish there were more dvds. In Croatia a roman amphitheater is still in use, I'd love to go there. agent_1:That would be an amazing place to attend a concert. The pictures, the sound, the memory. I would love to do that too.  agent_2:I'm glad I got to see Linkin Park so many times when I did, since you never know when it will be over. I'm sad I never got to see the Ramones though. Before my time. They played over 2000 shows!	agent_1:I would have seen the Ramones. They have very catchy music and I'm not even a fan of much punk. I had no idea they played that many shows. I know they played at CBGB's a lot so I wonder how many of those were there and how many were tours. 	agent_2 likes music. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'genre', 'music'].

I didn't know Nevada is the only state to have a none of the above voting option? agent_2:I think that is a perfect option.  Sometimes there just arent good candidates. agent_1:I agree!! Did you know since 1900 the taller candidate has won by 75%?	agent_2:yeah, I guess people think dominance with height?  Not sure how that one works.

I play it a lot more than I follow it, but I do know that Roger Federer has the most Grand Slam titles in history! agent_2:I do, Juan Martin del Potro is one of my favorite players, do you know who he is? and Federer is a great player as well I really like him agent_1:I do not know much about Juan Martin del Potro.  I do know that he is Argentinian and a former US Open champion. agent_2:His a great player  he has played against Federer a couple of times, he was the champion back in 2009 as well agent_1:He is a good example of determination.  I know he had some struggles with wrist injuries and had to have a lot of surgeries.  To reach the pinnacle of the game after that is incredible! agent_2:Its been hard, 4 surgeries can really make you quite, but I guess it paid off and with hard work he was able to make it, Rafael Nadal also had a new injury agent_1:Nadal is a great player too.  Crazy to think that 56% of grand slam titles have gone to him, Djokovic, or Federer since 2000. agent_2:Really talented players, legends of the game, Federer is the first person in Switzerland to be honored with a official stamp agent_1:That is great.  He has held the #1 spot in the ATP rankings for 310 weeks!  That is Tiger Woods type stuff! agent_2:Yeah definitely, a low point in his career was 2016, he suffered a big injury then agent_1:Yes, while bathing his daughters of all things.  Crazy! agent_2:Really? I thought it was during a match, tough way of getting injured agent_1:Yea, no kidding.  Tennis players are usually in such good shape too.  The longest match ever went on for 11 hours over the course of 3 days! agent_2:11 hours and 3 days wow!! both players could get injured in the way agent_1:Yea, you would think that is borderline dangerous!	agent_2:That shouldnt be allowed anyways, do you know the tennis player Gael Memphis?	agent_1 likes sports. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'soccer', 'football'].

How does it get back to earth? agent_2:Right, I'll have to look that up. Indian government sets up a polling booth in a  forest that is full of lions for just one voter. agent_1:I wonder if that person even shows up to vote, or why he's in the jungle like that haha. Did you vote last election?	agent_2:Yes I did.

Long-time Yankee fan over here. agent_2:You probably won't like this but I'm Red Sox fan. I heard that Eric Hosmer signed with the San Diego Padres  for $144 million in an eight year contract. agent_1:Haha you're right I don't like the Red Sox. Yes I believe the Hosmer contract was last year. I think that's going to end up being a bad contract.	agent_2:Me too. I think its too much money for a player that has proven himself.

I hope not though. agent_1:Soon we will run out of helium. Earth will be virtually helium-free by the end of the 21st century. Where will it all go? agent_2:I know, where? Interesting when the earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long! agent_1:Now it's longer and getting even longer. Soon the workday will be 20 hours. I will retire then. agent_2:lol, good idea!!

6603	agent_1:Are you on Facebook by any chance? agent_2:yes , I found it interesting that mark zukerburg suffers from colorblindness  agent_1:I was not aware of that. Facebook debuted in 2004. I was not aware it had been so long. It makes me wonder how long I was on MySpace before that.   agent_2:I agree, I wonder why burger king wanted people to unfriend others  agent_1:I was not aware that they did. That's very strange. You'd think they'd rather advertise on the site since so many people are on there. Facebook makes most of it's revenue from advertisements.  agent_2:I understand that to be true also. I cant believe Iceland is using Facebook to rewrite their Constitution agent_1:That seems like a bad idea. People don't think before they type on Facebook and they're willing to be more ridiculous because they are behind a keyboard.  agent_2:Agreed. I have alsways really liked Micheal Jackson, and I knew he did work on the Simpsons agent_1:I have mixed feelings about him. As a pop star he was amazing, his personal life not so much. My understanding is that Freddie Mercury cancelled a duet with him because he insisted on bringing his llama to the studio. agent_2:Yes I understand the feelings, would have loved to see the 50 foot robot though agent_1:He had some very out there ideas. I did know that Eddie Van Halen Played the guitar solo in Beat It free of charge. agent_2:I did not know that either. and that Micheal helped write the soundtrack to sonic 3 agent_1:That seems very odd to me. Thinking back to the Sonic games they do not have music that I would have thought a high profile musician made.  agent_2:I would agree with that, but still good music. I knoew taylor swift removed her music from spotify but not pandora  agent_1:I wonder why? I use Pandora a lot. I often have it on when I exercise. They have a net income of $-16 million despite having $274 million in revenue. I really think they need to look into their overhead cost.   agent_2:I would agree. I know she didnt like how they pay artist. I did not know they were streaming comedy also agent_1:I didn't either. I have never tried to use it for that. I use Podcast apps for that purpose.

Are you Clint Eastwood? LOL. I've never ridden a horse, but they seem like majestic animals. agent_2:I wish I were Clint Eastwood! But I never knew that Iceland actually has a specific horses with a fifth speed, other horses do not have this ability for some reason agent_1:I don't understand the speeds. Trot, gallop, ??? What else is there? agent_2:yes its something called Tolt, I don't know exactly how fast that is though lol agent_1:I guess they have used horses there for many purposes. What do you think of the two high school students who rode their horses to school on 'no vehicles to school day', and got suspended? agent_2:I think that was genius but pretty dumb that they got suspended haha. What do you think about Dalmatians? Do you know how they are related to horses agent_1:I know that they are used by firefighters. I heard that they were deaf or something. agent_2:Yes a lot of them are actually deaf. What do you think about Elon Musk by the way? I know that's a change of topic haha	agent_1:That is a change of topic. He is not a dalmatian, or a horse, or deaf. I think that he is ambitious and trying to create new technology.

Did you know that Iceland had no public rail service?  agent_2:Yes, i did know that. Japan on the other hand has a tremendous rail service. if you plan to visit, the rail system is better than the highway. however the air travel in Iceland is probably cheaper.	agent_1:Did you know that bird's bones are hollow? 	agent_2 likes animals. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['animals', 'travel', 'travel'].

Do you know who invented the piano? agent_1:Wasn't in by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700 in Italy?	agent_2:That is correct.

I see their code of conduct state they are a DOG company.  agent_1:lol, I heard you can bring you dog to work while working there, kind of discriminating against cats though! agent_2:Kinda odd since dogs are normally louder and more likely to poop somewhere. Looks like Istanbul even has vending machines to release food and water for strays. agent_1:that is a great point! The US needs to get those vending machines, I would donate so many plastic bottles. That is nice of that country agent_2:I wonder where else the dogs go if not for vencing machines? agent_1:right, they probably go for trash cans unfortunately. Did you know dogs have 12 types of blood? agent_2:Makes sense for variety. Apparently they have doggie blood drives too! agent_1:that would be so awesome to volunteer at. I will have to look them up.

Do you like cars?  What do you think of Tesla? agent_1:Yes. Is it just me or is Tesla becoming a very popular car all of a sudden. Toyota owns 10% of Tesla, didn't know that  agent_2:I didn't know that either.  Tesla is growing in popularity. I think it is because of Elon Musk.   agent_1:Elon took a 78$ million paycut in 2014 and returned it all but $1! How crazy agent_2:He is impressive. Did you know he founded Paypal? agent_1:He did?

The Nationals recently traded Daniel Murphy and Matt Adams to the Cubs agent_2:I don't follow baseball much, but I do think I heard something recently in the news about how the Cubs won over the Phillies? It's so confusing when they trade players for me to follow! agent_1:Yea, I guess the manager Martinez isn't doing too good in Washington and traded them away agent_2:I think the Cubs have been having a lot of trouble with their player's health. I hope they can turn it around and have a good season! agent_1:Maybe, but the Cubs haven't been too lucky since they started in 1903 agent_2:I think I've heard about that...are they the team that one back to back and then haven't won another World Series since then? agent_1:The Cubs didn't win until 2016, they beat the Royals I believe  agent_2:Oops meant won not one. I remember a long time ago they lost in a famous World Series game to the White Sox. I'm glad they won recently, as it's been a long time! agent_1:Yea, When the Cubs won 5 million people celebrated in the street, they have been waiting a long time agent_2:I bet that was one of the best baseball celebrations ever! I heard that Ronald Regan was a broadcaster for the Cubs in the thirties. He had a very interesting life! agent_1:Yea, wonder if he called the infamous Billy Goat game agent_2:How do you play that? I heard that when the Cubs first started playing baseball they were the Chicago Orphans. I wonder what the story behind that is, though?	agent_1:I don't know, the Cubs were founded the same year as the Battle of Little Bighorn so maybe it has something to do with the times	agent_2 likes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'baseball', 'sports'].
2619	"agent_1:Do you like Taylor Swift? agent_2:I liked her country stuff and some of her earlier pop. How about you? agent_1:I do like her, specially her performance of the Reputation tour she had in Glendale. AZ agent_2:It seems like she and Kanye West have perpetual conflicts of one sort or the other.  First he crashed her award acceptance.  Then she is accused of stealing his music.  Social media was not kind to her over that accusation! agent_1:I think they were a bit unfair to her, it must be hard to be a celebrity, specially a really famous one like her agent_2:Well, they called her a ""snake"".  I like the way she turned it into a positive in her concert with imagery, a snake microphone, and a snake platform.  Snakes in general have an unwarranted bad reputation.  Do you have any experience with snakes? agent_1:No not really, but I love them many people are scared of them but I think they are interesting animals agent_2:I live in a rural area, so snakes are not uncommon.  I have a 4-5 foot common garter snake nesting at the base of my fig trees.  I like there because she eats the field mice and other critters who want my figs.  Too many people automatically assume snakes are poisonous.  Did you know that only in Australia do venomous snakes outnumber non-venomous ones? agent_1:I didnt know that about Australia, are you afraid of snakes? with what you told me previously I bet you are not afraid of them agent_2:No.  I let them go on their way and I go one mine.  While we do have coral snakes, water moccasins, rattle snakes, I have never been bitten.  Did you know that one man has been bitten so often that the antigens in his blood allow it to be used an anti-venom? agent_1:Really? I guess he made a valuable contribution to science and also to medicine, did you hear of that species of flying snakes agent_2:I had not, but I could see it possible to approximate flying.  I know they can climb trees because I see the garter snake in my fig trees.  I guess if she wanted to, she could coil and spring, flinging herself from one tree to another.  Down here, Mardi Gras ended last night.   My ears are still ringing from the concerts put on by local bands.  Did you know that a Fighter Concert was so loud that it was picked up on New Zealand seismic (earthquake) monitors? agent_1:I didnt know that, do you have any favorite bands? used to like Linking Park agent_2:When I lived in Viginia, I liked Dave Matthews when he was starting out in Charlottesville.  Did you know that a woman driving to a Dave Matthews concert picked up a stranded bicyclist who was Dave Matthews himself! agent_1:Wow, that is amazing, I mean what are the ods, that woman is really lucky, I bet she went crazy in that moment."	agent_2:I would think so.  I have not been to an major act indoor concert since my high school and college days in the 1970s and the 1980s.  Back then Deep Purple broke the record for the loudest concert ever that rendered 3 people unconscious.

I suppose that shows there's something very fundamentally human in dance. agent_2:Not just human! Parrots are able to dance perfectly to music. They speculate it's tied into their ability to mimic. agent_1:Wow, I guess everything with a heartbeat probably feels some impulse to dance. More advanced forms of dance have aesthetic and symbolic value.  agent_2:Did you know Emilia Clarke did the funky chicken and robot dance to audition for Game of Thrones? agent_1:LOL, no. Can't imagine how that would help her get the part? I do know that Bruce Lee once won a cha-cha competition in Hong Kong. agent_2:That's pretty funny. Apparently, Mr. Rogers learned to breakdance on an episode. agent_1:And rapper Tupac Shakur danced in the Nutcracker in high school. Sounds like he and Mr Rogers swapped paths along the way. agent_2:Haha. Like Bill Bailey, an old tap dancer and Michael Jackson! Bill Bailey was first recorded moonwalking in 1955. agent_1:So someone was moonwalking for anyone (literally) moon walked?  agent_2:Ha! That's a funny way to put it. I wonder what the called it back then? Maybe if he had been wearing those ballet slippers that make drawings from the movements we could come up with a better name. agent_1:I hear they go through four pairs of pointe shoes a week. Lots of wear. agent_2:Soundtracks are important in dance, as well as movies, too. agent_1:Yep. And some become bigger hits than the movies, such as the soundtrack to ""O, Brother, Where Art Thou?"". It went octuple platinum. agent_2:Alicia Keys wrote a song for the Men in Black soundtrack when she was only 16! agent_1:That's impressive, although I haven't heard the tune. I know that Channing Tatum got his start dancing in Step Up when he was young. Met his wife that way. agent_2:Yeah, it's too bad about their divorce. agent_1:It appears to have been amicable, which is nice.

Have you seen Jiro Dreams of Sushi? Great film! agent_2:Oh you definitely should go! If I can recommend the testing menu, it's a little pricey at $120 but worth every penny. I adore that film!  agent_1:The tasting menu at Sushi Nakazawa? How many times have you gone? agent_2:Yes that's the one! I have went twice. Once on a date and the other for a work dinner with my client. Every course is a surprise, there isn't actually any menus! agent_1:You've got to be a real foodie to take a risk like that! Most of my friends wouldn't go because they couldn't choose. Some people love an adventure. Some don't. It's a bit like the jazz of restaurants, right? A bit of improvisation.	agent_2:That is definitely a good example! Did you know Clint Eastwood loves jazz? He has even scored a bunch of films	agent_1 likes movie. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'food', 'restaurant'].
1672	agent_1:Good Morning! Do you like to watch horror films? agent_2:Hi, how are you? I am not really a fan of the genre, though I have some favorites. agent_1:What are some of your favorite ones? Stephen king considers Bambi one haha. agent_2:King was just a kid, to be fair. That movie could be scary to a tiny child. He then turned his fright into a profession.	agent_1:You're right on that one. Did you know you can burn 180 calories watching one?	agent_2 dislikes movies. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movies', 'movie', 'favorite movie'].
9000	agent_1:DO you like Jazz ? There is a lot of people who like Jazz, like Clint Eastwood.  agent_2:Yes, Jazz is an art form that has been around a long time. It originated in African- American communities in the late 19th, early 20th century. agent_1:Yeah, it is a recent art, it started to be recognized as an official music current  in the 1920s.   agent_2:There is a woman in Harlem who has held free jazz concerts at her apartment for 20 years! agent_1:I wonder if her neighbors liked it. It must have been noisy.  agent_2:I am sure they enjoyed when the top performers came over, would be a treat. agent_1: It must have drawn a crowd, a crowded apartment is quite noisy.    agent_2:Yes, jazz is also big worldwide, a Pakistani jazz orchestra is topping the charts. agent_1:Would you like it if your neighbor held a jazz concert every Sunday ?  agent_2:It would depend on how far they are and the noise level, not in close proximity with loud noise. agent_1:It is an apartment, so there would a wall between you and the concert.  agent_2:Guess the only way to know is to attend and see what it's like. Did you know that Neptune made a full orbit in 2011, the first since being discovered? agent_1:Yeah, the solar system is quite peculiar, the sun represent 99.86 of all mass in the solar system. Knowing, that losing weight seems futile in the scheme of the universe.  agent_2:Yes we are a cosmic dust ball haha, the largest star in our galaxy is 1 billion times bigger. agent_1:There is so much that we cannot grasp about the universe until we now enough science, like the sun is white, it is yellow because of our atmosphere. agent_2:Yep, and a lightning bolt is 5x hotter than the surface of the sun, crazy! agent_1:Yeah it is surprising that something on Earth could be hotter than the sun.  agent_2:I know right, what do you think about fiction? agent_1:I love fiction, I read a lot of stories but I don't write any , unlike Julius Ceasar who wrote stories about Hercules and Oedipus. 	agent_2:Basically fan fiction, George rr martin doesn't like fan fiction though, but fan fiction may have to finish Game of Thrones at his writing rate.	agent_1 likes TV shows. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV shows', 'music', 'concert'].
2751	agent_1:Good morning! Do you know anything about snakes? I saw a huge one on reddit the other day! agent_2:I know that they are elongated and legless reptiles covered in scales. Furthermore, they have highly mobile jaws and usually fangs for venom. agent_1:That's true. My husband pulled one out of my garden. I had never seen it before. It's a rat snake. I guess they are good for killing pests. agent_2:I think rat snakes aren't poisonous? Did you know that the fear of snakes are wired into human brains? I guess people who hate snakes should live in new Zealand since there aren't any there. agent_1:Nope, rat snakes aren't poisonous. They are actually a good kind. I have always believed no snakes should exist, so I believe we are wired for it! agent_2:I wonder what differentiates snakes from legless lizards? agent_1:That is a good question. Maybe that lizards have eyelids and some snakes dont.  agent_2:That makes sense. Personally, I don't mind snakes, although I am wary since venom can be quite potent and dangerous. As long as they aren't flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey are around my area and I can spot them well a head of time, I'm okay. agent_1:flying snakes? My worst nightmare!! agent_2:I guess New Zealand would be ideal for you, with no snakes and all agent_1:True! Do you ever Listen to Taylor Swift? agent_2:I have heard bits hear and there and recently read some articles, but I am not completely familiar. agent_1:She writes a lot of her music about herself. Very popular singer. Who do you listen to? agent_2:Well I do know Kanye did a self mocking skit 2 years before the infamous Taylor swift incident. Other than that, she is among the worlds contemporary artists. agent_1:And she owns a private jet! agent_2:I recently learn she once accidentally released several seconds of white noise and it somehow topped the Canadian itunes chart. agent_1:That is funny! But she also thinks music should not be free. I disagree there. I should be able to listen to it all I want. agent_2:Well for artists, royalties are a lot part of their revenue, even for moderate artists. agent_1:Thats true I suppose. Do you know Swift walks backwards so she wont have her pic taken?	agent_2:Wouldn't walking backwards make her stick out more?	agent_1 dislikes fashion. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['fashion', 'music', 'music'].

But if you ever go to Ireland or France, you can see it there, too! Evidently there are twin White Houses there. agent_2:I bet that it would be a good replica too. i guess i could start there, maybe try out the oval office, see how it feels. agent_1:Haha. Did you know George Bush had solar panels put back on the White House? agent_2:yeah, carter put them on, reagan too them off. what about trump? what happened to the panels? agent_1:I'm not sure. They should keep them there. It's good for the environment! I'm surprised Bush was an advocate being an oil fan. agent_2:I think that he did that for PR reasons. i think that it would look bad for an oilman to do that. i would love more solar in the country. agent_1:Teddy Roosevelt was quite the conservationist, as well. He banned Christmas trees from the White House during his day. agent_2:Teddy always went out hunting wild animals. i dont understand his thinking. no trees, but animals, yes? agent_1:Maybe he was only hunting the animals that were overpopulated and bad for the environment? agent_2:Maybe, that is true. i just thought that he would want to leave the animals alone. He was behind the national parks too. great guy for conservation. agent_1:Yeah, but there are some animals that can become a problem if they aren't hunted, unfortunately. Just the circle of life.  agent_2:True. Maybe he was looking to maintain a balance. The white house still uses floppy disks in part for storing files. I wonder if they used those in Teddy Roosevelt's day? LOL	agent_1:Haha. I would think not. Though, I bet his documents were transcribed and put onto a floppy disk!	agent_2 dislikes work. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['work', 'hobby', 'hobby type'].

I think I will enjoy it. All the cover-ups! agent_1:I agree, theres a lot of interesting stories in her memoirs, like anecdotes about ''The Post'', ''The Iron Lady'', I might buy it and pick it as my next audiobook agent_2:Thats good. The Wife Between us sounds like a drama! Would have to be in the mood for that. agent_1:I like the plot, it seems a bit dark, an abused ex-wife  stalking her former husband, thats an odd couple agent_2:yes, I like period pieces, so the Revolution of the Moon sounds interesting! agent_1:That is a great book and Andrea Camilleri is a great author, I like her style,,  agent_2:Good, I love anything on the solar system, the moon, saturn etc. Do you? agent_1:I am in love with the moon, its so beautiful, I envy the astronauts that could see earth from up there, a unique landscape indeed agent_2:Agree, So glad Nasa made the right choice putting the US flag and not the UN flag!	agent_1:Yeah, after all NASA is American and its our achievement, you know there might be life on Titan	agent_2 likes NASA. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['NASA', 'hobby', 'audiobooks'].

I didn't know Ricky Gervais was a pop singer in the 80s, it's hard to imagine agent_2:i know ! i never would have thought that either! agent_1:Apparently scientist voted ""We are the Champions"" as the catchiest pop song, I wonder how they came up with that"	agent_2:im not sure , but they are probably right.	agent_1 dislikes politics. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'music', 'artist'].

I did not know that about the day being so short agent_1:Yeah when you think about it it makes it ever sadder to what we are doing to this planet agent_2:Well, the UN has appointed an official ambassador to extraterrestrials so hopefully we make some alien friends soon so we can move planets.  agent_1:haha, that would be kind of cool. apparently earth will be helium free by the end of this century agent_2:No more helium balloons?

13138	agent_1:Hello, do you enjoy traveling? agent_2:I love to travel.  How about you? agent_1:I love traveling as well. The Dutch are creating a bus that can go 160 mph. agent_2:That is crazy.  I wonder if it will have a special lane?  When I heard that I thought of the Night Bus from Harry Potter. agent_1:I have no idea. All of Japan's highways are tolls so it cost roughly $300 to cross the country. agent_2:That is a lot of money.  Iceland doesnt have a public rail service, so people without cars take flights between cities. agent_1:That would stink to not have public rail service. I can't imagine having to fly everywhere. agent_2:Same here.  But I guess if we want to travel across the country we do, but not within our own states. agent_1:Yes. The first king to travel around the world was from Hawaii. agent_2:I didnt even know Hawaii had a king.   agent_1:Me either lol. Do you know much about Kim Jong-Un? agent_2:Some, I was shocked to read he is my age (a few months older) even though it is also said that they are unsure of his age. agent_1:That's interesting. He's a very bad leader so hopefully Trump can talk some sense into him. agent_2:He isnt a great person, he had his own uncle executed, so I doubt that is a possibility. agent_1:I agree. He learned to drive at the age of 3. agent_2:3!  I was tripping over my own feet at three!  agent_1:LOL. He was also voted the most sexiest man alive by the onion. agent_2:I heard China believes that too!  	agent_1:I have heard that as well.

9384	agent_1:Have you read Book Club or Fifty Shades of Grey? agent_2:No I haven't.  I've seen commercials for both movies and Book Club looks interesting.  I like Diane Keaton, Candice Bergen, and Mary Steenburgen.  Have you read the books? agent_1:I havent, I did see the movies, the Book Club movie was pretty good and Im guessing the book is better, the movie grossed around 12 million agent_2:I think Book Club mentions other books such as Moby Dick and Fifty Shades of Grey. agent_1:Well its a romantic comedy novel,  and yeah books like Fifty Shades are referenced in it also Don Quixote, so seems interesting	agent_2:I think mentioning other literature like A midsummer Night's Dream in the movie can inspire readers and movie watchers to read more.	agent_1 likes movie. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'commercial', 'Book Club'].
11017	agent_1:Do you like fish?  agent_2:I love fish, looking at them and eating them also agent_1:Did you know a seahorse is the only fish to have a neck?  agent_2:that is so interesting, I wonder why they declared that a fish if it is the only one with a neck agent_1:I'm not sure, what about eels?  agent_2:Eels are scary, I always remember the little mermaid when I think of eels, lol. What do you think about them? agent_1:Not much. Did you know there is a jellyfish that is immortal?  agent_2:I would not want to cross paths with that. I think there has to be something that could kill it. agent_1:I'm not sure, I don't think that can be real, can it?  agent_2:I don't think so, maybe I will look it up lol. One thing I wouldnt cross either is the black swallower fish, have you heard of that one? agent_1:Me either. What about shoes, any interest?  agent_2:I love my shoes! I like nike mostly, how about you agent_1:I'm more of an adidas fan, but I have some Nikes.  agent_2:Did you ever have the stephon marbury shoes back in the day? agent_1:No, but I had some air jordans?  agent_2:Nice, I love air jordans.

I've even read some hunting poetry from Africa. agent_2:That sounds very interesting.  Did you know Edgar Allan Poe only got $9 for his ""The Raven"" poem?   agent_1:No that is amazing!  I remember reading that in High Shool. agent_2:Yeah I will always remember that poem from a halloween episode of the Simpsons.   agent_1:Some of the earliest written poetry comes from Africa, around the 25th century BCE.  agent_2:I am really interested in reading some of that it sounds so cool.   agent_1:Do you like astronomy?  I have always found Earth fascinating.  It was formed 4.5 billion years ago!  That's so old! agent_2:Yeah I love learning and reading about it, so cool.  That is old!  Did you know years from now the earth will be helium-free?  agent_1:I did not know that.  I do find it sad however, that 80 percent of earth's forests have already been destroyed. agent_2:Yeah I think I read that somewhere as well.  It is very sad to me to think about that, and I'm sure it will continue to be destroyed.  agent_1:We think of a day as being 24 hours long.  But when Earth was first formed, a day was only 5.5 hours! agent_2:That is crazy to think how much longer the days are now.  Imagine going back to 5.5 days! You would feel like you lived a lifetime in a week lol.  agent_1:If earth's  history was viewed in a 24 hour period.  Humans would only represent about 1 minute and 17 seconds.  Shows you how young we really are! agent_2:Yeah that really makes you think!  Did you know that 71% of the earth's surface is covered by water? agent_1:Yea I have heard that.  And the remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands.  agent_2:Yeah its just crazy thinking how vast the oceans really are.

We like to grill a lot outside, which helps not make our home more hot. agent_2:Grilling out is the best to help with the heat inside the house. If I have to cook in the house i do it early in the morning before it gets too hot. agent_1:Yes that's another great idea. We also sometimes eat out if it is way too hot, or eating something like salads or cereal. Where we aren't using heat at all. agent_2:That is a great idea. We tend to eat leftovers too and just use the micorwave. agent_1:The microwave is great and fast, I agree. Making Icecream is a great way to cool down when it gets too hot. We also tend to use box fans. agent_2:We use a fan for sure. Also started using like a slow cooker or toaster oven not as hot and now can fit up to a whole chicken. agent_1:Great appliances help to cook! We love our air-fryer. Though it tends to eat up the area some, so we open the doors and dim the lights to help with the heat. agent_2:I heard some people turn their wrist upside down  to get their blood flowing to stay cool. agent_1:Wow great information, I will have to try that sometime.

He did a good job adapting Martin's fantasy novels into a tv series. agent_2:George R. R. Martin is one of my favorite writters as well, I didnt know the show was filmed in Ireland, the country has beutiful landscapes agent_1:They did a good job worldbuilding and making a somewhat medieval setting agent_2:Yeah and also picking up the cast, like Harry Lloyd, he is a decendant of Dickens agent_1:Ya an talisa maegyr is played by charlie chaplin's granddaughter agent_2:A lot of talent in the show, there is a natgeo show called Game of Lions, seems like a fun show to watch lol agent_1:Well another good decision aside from the scene the director made is to film it in ireland. They actually get financed by ireland since the film would encourage tourism	agent_2:I wonder if that strategy works for the country, I guess it does since many people around the world watch the show	agent_1 likes TV show. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV show', 'favorite TV show', 'game of thrones'].
2935	agent_1:Do you own a dog?  agent_2:I do, did you know that dogs were the first species to be domesticated? agent_1:No, I didn't. I bet that is why they call them man's best friend.  agent_2:I guess so. They perform so many roles for humans, like hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, and companionship. I guess there's a reason why they are called that. They do a lot for humans. agent_1:Yeah. Apparently there are 12 different types of blood that a dog may have.  agent_2:I didn't know that. I wonder if they get good prizes at blood drives? agent_1:LOL, good question. Google prefers dogs to cats, did you know that?  agent_2:I did not know that. Did you know that Istanbul has vending machines with food and water for stray dogs in exchange for recycled plastic bottles. I think that's such a neat idea.  agent_1:No, I've never been to turkey.

1554	agent_1:Government is fascinating. It seems so different the world over yet there are common threads in every type.  agent_2:I agree. Some governments try to help, others, not so much. agent_1:So true. I wonder what america would look like if we had a PM instead of a president. A PM seems to be held more accountable for their actions.  agent_2:True. Much easier to remove. Australia's PM position isn't in the constitution and exists only through custom. That seems strange to me. Not in the Constitution? agent_1:Australia's constitution is weird though. It doesn't protect the people as much like an american one does.  agent_2:I did not know that. Number 10 Downing Street has a cat with a title! I wonder how many other government headquarters have animals like that. agent_1:With all the historic buildings in the UK I could see why they need one. Older structures like that tend to attract rodents.  agent_2:Is one cat enough though? Might need a support staff. agent_1:Right? lol. I wonder if you can meet the cat if you tour the offices? agent_2:The cat doesn't take visitors without an appointment. agent_1:I could see the cat being involved in a lot of the pranks the UK officials seem to play on each other.  agent_2:When you turn 100 in japan, the PM gives you a silver cup to celebrate. Too many people are turning 100 so that they had to find a way to make cheaper cups. Maybe give the cup when people turn 200? agent_1:That would be one way to cut the costs. How many people are turning 100 that it is costing enough to have to find a cheaper solution? Talk about a healthy society.  agent_2:Yeah. Celebrating a centennial is cool, but the gov't can't afford it! Are you a fan of Johnny Depp? agent_1:I find him very interesting. He is one of those chameleon actors that you never watch and go Oh that's Johnny Depp he sort of absorbs the character.  agent_2:Johnny  is producing and maybe starring in a biopic about  Dr. Seuss. I would be interested in that. agent_1:I think he would make a fantastic Dr. Seuss Look what an amazing job he did with willy wonka. I think the creepy edge he gave to the character was perfect.  agent_2:He is really dedicated to his craft. Edward Scissorhands was an odd film, but he made it work. agent_1:That whole movie was just weird. He might be a strange man but he seems to really have a good heart. 	agent_2:I know that he often visits children in the hospital dressed up as a pirate.	agent_1 likes family. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['family', 'politics', 'no'].

Do you like dogs? agent_1:I love dogs, they have 12 types of blood agent_2:I had no idea about that.  i guess that means it's hard for them to get blood transfers when they need one.   agent_1:yeah but good things is that there are dog blood drives agent_2:Are there really?  I have never seen or heard about one before. I would definitely take my dog to give blood if I could. agent_1:Yeah not sure which countries have them though. do you know how tou can help dogs in Istanbul? agent_2:I  think I have heard about that country having vending machines for food and water for stray dogs. All that is required for payment is plastic bottles. agent_1:yeah I really like that approach, that is super nice for the dogs and the environment agent_2:I like it too.  America and actually, all other countries, should adopt that approach.  Dogs are very smart. They are the only animal other than an elephant that understands pointing. agent_1:that is true, you are right. google even prefers dogs agent_2:I am glad to hear that for some reason!  I like knowing that one of my favorite sites to use likes dogs. I am surprised though that they have taken a stand regarding it.	agent_1:yeah it is in their code of conduct even	agent_2 likes work. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['work', 'pets', 'dog rescue'].

And animals develop white patches on their head when they are domesticated. agent_2:Thats a cool fact I wonder why, my dog doesnt have that patch, I might have to look at him closer, incredible how evolution acted on us, on species	agent_1:Yea it is interesting I wonder why we dont have it as well as I feel like we have basically domesticated ourselves. 	agent_2 likes hobby. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobby', 'pets', 'dog'].
10744	agent_1:Hi there! Have you ever had a pet bird? agent_2:No I haven't but I have memories of friends who did when I was growing up.  How about you? agent_1:Yes, I have had pet birds. I've had cockatiels, parakeets, and some fancier parrots when I was a kid. Did you know the famously extinct Dodo bird, is closely related to the pigeon? agent_2:That is awesome, so you are quite the bird expert.  I didn't know that, very interesting though.   agent_1:Haha! I know a few fun facts about birds. Such as in most birds the bones are so hollow that the feathers weigh more than the entire skeleton!  agent_2:That is awesome, I guess it makes sense though when you figure they have to be able to stay airborne.  agent_1:Apparently, humingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. I was always curious how they built such strong little nests! agent_2:That is so cool, I love learning about how different species in nature interact with each other to help themselves.  agent_1:Yeah, we are learning so much about so many things, these days! There are birds in Australia that can mimic the sound of car alarms, cameras and chain saws. I wonder if they are mockingbirds. agent_2:That is awesome, and yeah good one.  I wonder why they would mimic them as well? agent_1:It's interesting, but I also find it kind of sad that they mimic human made objects. Birds are amazing to me! Some birds fly from Alaska to Mexico, without sleeping when migrating! 	agent_2:That is amazing for an animal to do that, sleeping is necessary, some animals sleep for crazy periods of time!	agent_1 dislikes sleep. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sleep', 'pets', 'birds'].

I would be comfortable in Hawaii where the aloha shirt is official business attire. agent_1:Wouldn't that be awesome to go to work like that!  At Billy Mays funeral the pallbearers all wore blue shirts and khaki pants. agent_2:Yeah, the ""shirt"" covers such a broad variety of garments that cover the upper body.  A shirt can also be worn as a necktie. agent_1:True.  I've used them over my head to keep the sun off me. lol agent_2:Is it proper to wear shirts and boots that match? agent_1:I would guess so? lol  Do you own a pair of Ugg boots? agent_2:I use to back when I was stationed in California and took up surfing.  They were actually invented by surfers to keep their feet warm after getting out of the ocean. agent_1:Nice.  I was going to ask if you lived by the ocean. I've never had any even though I live by Lake Michigan.  The Nokia company originally started making rubber boots in the 1800's and they still make them to this day. agent_2:I use to live near Lake Michigan.  I have been to both oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. I don't know if my Ugg boots would go well with my Hawaiian shirt.  What do you think?  agent_1:That's awesome you've been able to see all those places.  The way I see it if you have the chance to where you can wear both at the same time, then go for it.  Life is about have fun right? lol agent_2:I suppose.  Talking about having fun.  Did you know that farmers use to put custom boots on their turkeys.  That's just weird! lol agent_1:lol That's funny.  I wonder if they did it so they wouldn't get clawed?  My friend had chickens growing up and they had a rooster that was super mean and would go out of it's way to try to claw you. agent_2:Need to see if that rooster could take out a dog!  Some roosters have pretty long spikes on their feet. agent_1:Oh yeah.  That sucker was mean let me tell you.  I think I would have a rabid dog chase me, which by the way dogs are not color blind! agent_2:We could call the bout a "" Cock-a-Poodle-Do"".  That was bad! lol.  I know dogs aren't color blind but they don't see as many colors as humans do. agent_1:LOL That's funny!  Google prefers dogs over cats!

1941	agent_1:Are you a fan of jazz by any chance? agent_2:I like jazz but cant say I really know much about it. agent_1:It's an interesting genre. Jazz trumpeters grew goatees because it provided comfort when playing.  agent_2:that is interesting. Tupac Shakur studied jazz when he was in baltimore school of the arts agent_1:I would not have expected that at all. Things may have gone differently for him had he followed that passion. I know that the New Orleans style of jazz started in the 1910's.  agent_2:thats over a 100 years ago. Jazz has been seen as a major form of musical expression since the 1920's  agent_1:That is an old form of music especially compared to the most popular forms of music now. Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts. agent_2:I never new that . Did you know that louis armstrong ended the beatles three months on the billboard top 100 agent_1:WOW! I didn't think anything could stop The Beatles. No offence to Armstrong but I know a lot more people that still listen to The Beatles.  agent_2:This is a pretty interesting guitar fact,  A dial tone is in the key of f, serving as a pre-internet trick to tune your guitar agent_1:WOW! That's clever. I enjoy guitar music. Queen's guitarist, Brian may, has a PHD in astrophysics. agent_2:he also built a guitar out of parts from an old fire place and his mothers knitting needles . super smart agent_1:Yes. Honestly all of Queen always struck me as a very intelligent group of men. I am also a big fan.  agent_2:I agree. did you know that the nokia ringtone  from a 1902 composition by spanish classical guitarist and composer francisco tarrega, called gran vals. agent_1:I did not. It's been so long that I honestly can't remember what that sounded like. I wonder where the iPhone ring tone came from because I hear that everywhere lol.  agent_2:have you ever heard about a mute man from england that could only communicate to others with a piano agent_1:I had not heard that but it's actually quite touching that he could find a way. Speaking of piano, Freddie mercury used the same piano to record bohemian rhapsody as paul mccartney used to record hey jude. agent_2:thats interesting  agent_1:I thought so. I can't play piano but I enjoy the sound. If I had the room a player piano would be nice.  agent_2:I like pianos I would like to learn how play one. they used to have steam piano and they were audible for miles	agent_1:That must have been extremely loud up close. 	agent_2 dislikes music. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'guitar fact', 'music'].

Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer? agent_1:I heard that, winning Cha Cha championships and everything! agent_2:Yes that is amazing. He won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship back in 1958 in fact. agent_1:I always just thought of him as a martial arts legend.  Now he is a dance legend of sorts too! agent_2:Yeah!! That is correct.

It does have the second highest attendance. agent_1:Baseball games are fun to go to but they take a long time. I usually end up walking around the concourse for a couple innings. agent_2:I never knew why baseball managers wore uniforms. I thought it was just to blend in with the team and support the team. Ends up they are able to play if the need arises. agent_1:Looking at some of the managers today I think it's more of a tradition now. I know in the past there were a few times where there were actual player/coaches. I believe Ted Williams was one. agent_2:I found it very surprising that a married couple had been scheduling all 2430 major league baseball games up until 2005. I figured it was just a computer. agent_1:Baseball is deep into it's tradition. They probably didn't worry about any form of software until it became too complicated. agent_2:You're right. That's probably why baseball cards are so popular too, tradition. A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in his grandfathers attic. agent_1:Also the market was not as saturated back then as it is today, now so many different companies make cards that there isn't a chance for them to be as rare.	agent_2:I never knew that is why the old ones are so valuable. I thought it was simply the popularity of the player. In Japan baseball is so popular fans do not realize it is actually America's pastime.

I have watched him a few times in interviews. agent_2:Yeah he's very entertaining and interviews I think. It is crazy to me though that the Tesla Model S is so safe that somehow it broke the safety testing equipment, I don't know how that's possible LOL agent_1:Really, I agree, How does that happen? Saw where he took a  $78 million pay cut in 2014. agent_2:Yeah that is impressive. It's also impressive that Tesla releases their patents in order to encourage competition, I definitely would not do that if I owned the company haha	agent_1:Most people wouldn't, wonder why?

It's too bad it doesn't have Game of Thrones though, that show has gotten 37 emmy awards. agent_1:I do like GOT! George RR Martin is the author and a genius! agent_2:It is such a hit parents are naming their kids Arya.  Only a couple more months until the last season starts. agent_1:ya I can't wait, weird that charlie Chaplins granddaughter is in the show too! agent_2:Wonder if they ever offered Tom Cruise a part, he has won so many awards for best actor, they probably can't afford him. agent_1:ya, he is a great actor though, so many classic roles like Maverick in Top gun and Ron Kovic in Born on the Fourth of July agent_2:Yeah I really like him in The Last Samurai.  He spend time learning Japanese and swordplay on this own to prepare for the role.  Good on him. agent_1:yup I like that movie, I never realized samurai was plural and refers to the whole group and not just Tom Cruise haha agent_2:I liked him in Rainman too, that movie won Best Picture.  I think one of my favorites is when he plays a hitman in Collateral with Jamie Foxx. agent_1:oh ya that is a really good movie, he is kind of looney though he spent 10 million dollars to build a bunker to protect himself from aliens agent_2:Yeah I think he is into Scientology. Did you know he was married to Nicole Kidman? They have since divorced.  Though they did so Eyes Wide Shut together. agent_1:lol, that is a weird movie though, Seinfeld is super rich though, richer than Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise combined apparently  agent_2:Well I am just glad I do not have any stock in MoviePass.  It fell to under a dollar after people found out Christopher Robin was not being shown last summer. agent_1:oh wow ya I'm glad I didn't get that, I just use Netflix and thats enough for me	agent_2:Netflix is piling up debt to fund all these new series and shows, 21.9 billion at last count.

I saw that Wikileaks published the government's plan to destroy Wikileaks.  agent_2:Wikileaks is not going to be outsmarted by the government. I'm not sure how the gov't could destroy Wikileaks anyway. Too many sites, too many backups. agent_1:I agree. Did you know 86% of the land in Nevada is owned by the government? agent_2:The gov't must be up to something in Nevada. Maybe Wikileaks knows something about this. agent_1:That's where Area 51 is located so I'm sure there are lots of secret bases in that state. agent_2:I think Area 51 is in New Mexico, but I'm not sure. Lots of open space in Nevada.  agent_1:Oh yea you might be right lol. In 2006, the US passed a bill that would protect the government employees from being charged for violating the geneva conventions. agent_2:I think that is wrong, but probably there to protect military contractors and stuff. A lot of war going on in 2006. Probably a lot of liability.  agent_1:Yea, I was deployed to Iraq for the war back in 2005-2006 and then again in 2007.	agent_2:Hm.

Also plays the piano and scores movies. agent_1:Talented guy, what are your thoughts on the goatees some of the pleyers grow? agent_2: I like them. kinda sets them apart from other musicians. 1970's was the era for jazz. agent_1:It surely does, its characteristic of the genre, apparently they grow them for comfort agent_2:I could see that. Especially with a sax leaning on your chin all the time! agent_1:Yeah, the hairs can reduce the frictioin and help them, Pakistan has a great jazz orchestra maybe they all have goatees	agent_2:wouldn't that be something to see!

I know that black swallower fish can eat prey twice its own length and ten times its weight. I am very impressed with that fact.  agent_1:That is pretty amazing!  I don't think I could eat that much,  but sometimes it feels like I do!  did you know there a breed of jelly fish and lobster that is immortal.  Of course its only immortal if no one kills it lol but it literally can live forever! agent_2:I actually have heard that before and wondered why we are not studying jellyfish more to find out how and why that is possible. Could we use that to our benefit in any way I wonder?  agent_1:I do not know,  I just seen it on Blue Planet on Netflix lol maybe their organs do not age after a certain poing lol  agent_2:Maybe. I would really like them to find out more about that. Did you know that a seahorse is the only fish with a neck? agent_1:Yeah that is interesting!  Some fish look like they have necks though lol so they have necks and can carry a baby good for them.  agent_2:Yes some do but only the seahorse truly does. Freshwater fish only ""drink"" water through their skin via osmosis, while saltwater fish also drink water through their mouths. I wonder how evolution made that chnage in the two? agent_1:Yeah you would think drinking salty water through your mouth would taste bad lol  agent_2:For us I'm sure it would. I wonder how their sense of taste differs? The last fish fact I have is that 84 per cent of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish. agent_1:Oh wow,  I dont even know that fish,  I hope it looks like a Zebra!  Do you like Jazz? agent_2:I'm not a big fan but I certainly appreciate the genre and the performers.  agent_1:It looks like clint eastwood is a jazz fan.  I wouldve thought country lol  agent_2:That is surprising. I know he is a big fan of music because he has scored several films  including Million Dollar Baby. agent_1:That movie was so sad.  Did you know Pakistan has a jazz orchestra? agent_2:It was. No I was not aware of that. I wonder what that is like? I did know that a Harlem woman has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every sunday for 20 years. top performers occasionally stop by. agent_1:Wow that is smart,  also she keeps all the money instead of giving money to a venue lol awesome.  agent_2:Very good business model.

There has not been a US President since 1953 that was not a Democrat or a Republican. agent_2:Really since 1953? the other parties should really step up their game agent_1:Oh darn it, no I meant 1853, so it's been even longer!  agent_2:Oh that's surprising, maybe one day a president from one of the other parties will win. The last election was a joke I didn't like either of the candidates  agent_1:I guess every US president until recent that has had a beard is Republican. agent_2:Seems like you know a lot about the Republican party any cool facts about the democrats? agent_1:I'm not sure.

I like to look up information a lot on YouTube. It is so handy. I'm not surprised the search engine is the second largest. agent_2:Yeah the second largest after Google and its also owned by Google so there is a monopoly in that field.  agent_1:I just can not believe that Google paid $1.65 billion for it! agent_2:Sounds like a great deal, YouTube must be worth a lot more by now.

I think that's Saturn's most well known moon. agent_2:Mars' mon Phobos is one third hollow, that's crazy agent_1:That is crazy.

Why? is kickball not clear enough? boy those canadians need to have a word for everything LOL agent_1:LOL I agree. A man once found $3 million dollars worth in baseball cards. agent_2:that is a terrific find. i would probably sell a few, but keep the rest as an investment. what about you? agent_1:I agree, I would definitely sell the rest so I could retire early lol. agent_2:Yeah, that's true. buy stock and live off the dividends. did you watch the world series last year?	agent_1:I didn't get to watch it. What about you?	agent_2 dislikes movie. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'hobby', 'selling old items'].
8977	"agent_1:Hi There ! Looking forward to chat with You ! ;) agent_2:Hello! Good i just read some really interesting stuff about Jazz music. Did you know it started in the great city of New Orleans? agent_1:Yes, I believe I was aware of that fact. Are You a jazz lover ? agent_2:I am! It is a great style some people consider it America's classical music today. agent_1:Yes sir... I love how every song and solo can sound totally different - even when played by the same musician... agent_2:Yes it is truly something. I have heard that New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s. agent_1:That I'm not sure about... don't know the exact date, but I always wondered how a music style begins... it's not like a guy is sitting on it's porch and thinks... ""I'm going to invent new music style and I'll call it JAZZ"" :) agent_2:Haha! Yeah i have always wondered things like that. But I have heard that Clint eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast who knew huh? agent_1:I can believe that... he is a classy Dude ;) I don't imagine him listening to disco or rap ;) agent_2:Yeah he just does not seem like the guy that would be into that. But I think more people love jazz than we know A harlem woman has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every sunday for 20 years. agent_1:I'm sure there were a lot of enthusiasts of that ! Sounds like a good woman  agent_2:Yeah what kind of stuff is on your mind that you would like to talk about? agent_1:You know Edgar allen poe poetry ? agent_2:I am he was a fiction writer correct? agent_1:Yes - really dark poetry sometimes -  He wrote wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction. Pretty interesting ! ;) agent_2:Yeah he was a special kinda person, If i recall he was the person who also wrote the poem about  the raven crying nevermore. agent_1:Yes I think You're right. Some of his poems were used in ""Nightmare on Elm street"" ;) agent_2:Really I had no idea. I wonder how they implemented them in the film? agent_1:Those were right before the movie began. Something about dreams - You know, movie related :)"	agent_2:I have not seen those movies in a very long time so it is all kinda blurry to me.

10140	agent_1:Hello,  do you know much about cinematography? agent_2:Not really, I'm an avid movie watcher. I have heard of Roger Deakins who constantly is getting nominated for awards. agent_1:Oh ok,  I havent heard of him. Thats great though,  hes been nomiated  times.  agent_2:Do you like visiting D.C.?  They have over 250 restaurants and a Summer Restaurant Week.  agent_1:I have never been there. I did read that recently.  Did you know no woman has ever been nominated for the academy award for best cinematography? agent_2:That will probably change soon.  I didn't know Stanley Kubrick was involved with Spartacus. 	agent_1:Me either.  do you like comedy?	agent_2 likes TV show. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV show', 'movie', 'director'].
6320	agent_1:Do you like baseball? agent_2:I love it. Do you know why the managers wear uniforms during games? agent_1:Yes they can play if their teams need them so they need to be ready agent_2:Yes. Do you know what kickball is called in Canada? agent_1:Yes it is called soccer-baseball agent_2:Yes I guess it makes sense that it has elements of both games agent_1:Yeah. Do you know who used to do the MLB schedule? agent_2:Yes it was a couple that did it for a whole 24 years	agent_1:Yes and they scheduled 2430 games each year	agent_2 likes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'family', 'grandparents'].
3019	"agent_1:Hi, how are you? agent_2:Hi, I'm Good. Have you heard of the book Strange objects? It is going to be a HBO miniseries. Many critics think it it the author's break through. agent_1:I have not heard of the book or the miniseries. I do have HBO and will look for it when it comes out. agent_2:That is good. It focuses on how the female characters negatively treat one another. It is unusual because it gives it's female characters permission to be bad. agent_1:Nice. I think I do remember that one now. It's with Amy Adams I think... I did see Gone Girl, did you see that one? agent_2:I didn't, but I know it is by the same author, Gillian Flynn. The author wrote Sharp Objects because she wanted to explore how women aren't innately good and was sick of literature's tendency to portray women as spunky girls or bad girls like tramps and vamps. agent_1:lynn's novels are feminist precisely because they aim a megawatt beam, bright as prison lights, into the dark corners of women's minds and lives agent_2:I think you can really see this in the first line of Sharp Objects, where she write that ""I was never a good little girl."" Amy Dunne in Gone Girl was the same way. agent_1:There's a wiki which ranks fictional characters according to their powers and abilities. agent_2:That is interesting. I wonder if Camille's (from Sharp Objects) beauty could be considered a power or ability. The novel manages to put an interesting spotlight on it. But, it doesn't reduce her or her beauty to an archetype. agent_1:Couldn't it be both? Couldn't her looks be a power and a liability when she uses them inappropriately? agent_2:Yes, that is a good point. I bet the author would like that give her attempts to avoid the archetypes surrounding beauty in fiction. Camille is neither an angel or a temptress. agent_1:Her beauty is part of her underlying charatcher which allows her to have so many more dimensions than just beauty."	agent_2:True, of course some people think that the author goes to far by making all her female characters unlikable. They think that this undermines women by portraying them this way.	agent_1 likes TV shows. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV shows', 'books', 'author'].
3419	agent_1:Good morning!  Do you watch baseball?  It can be a lucrative thing to be a fan of the game.  A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards once. agent_2:I am a baseball fan. I used to collect cards but I really doubt mine are worth 3 million dollars. agent_1:After hearing about that man I wish I had collected them.  The ones he found though were from the 1900s.  They had been stashed away since the 1940s.  agent_2:I could only imagine how exciting that was. My cards were from the late 1980s and 1990s, there were a lot of sets made then. I bet there were a lot less made in the 1900s. agent_1:I don't know actually.  The weird thing about baseball is that it's america's national pastime but it is super popular in Japan of all places. agent_2:I know that a few countries in Asia have really taken up baseball. A lot of former MLB players play in Korea as well. agent_1:I've heard that before.  Japan likes it so much that they are actually shocked to learn that it comes from america. agent_2:That surprises me because after World War 2 they have become a lot more open to Western culture and adopting some of our styles and customs. agent_1:It is surprising.  Speaking of surprising, did you know that the reason the managers wear uniforms is so they can go in the game if needed? agent_2:In previous years some players played a dual role as a manager as well. Now I don't think most managers would be able to last in the game. agent_1:True, some of them look a bit out of practice.  What do you think of softball?  I didn't know it was invented by the ymca. agent_2:I did not know that either. I enjoy playing softball, it is a lot more fun to play recreationally than baseball. agent_1:i like playing too.  What i learned recently was that it was originally invented as an indoor game though. I never knew that before! agent_2:I can't imagine it as an indoor game, that seems more like wiffleball to me. agent_1:It does seem odd.  You know, it's supposed to be a faster game than regular baseball and yet the longest softball game in history went for 31 innings.  That is a long game! agent_2:Any league I've played in always had rules to prevent that from happening! I couldn't imagine being involved for 31 innings, that's almost 3 baseball games.	agent_1:I imagine it was pretty tiring for everyone.  Softball really doesn't get as much respect as baseball even with that super long game.  Professional players only make around 5 or 6 thousand dollars a year.	agent_2 dislikes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'travel', 'Japan'].
11950	agent_1:Hey there. I just learned that GOP stands for Grand Old Party. Very traditional sounding. agent_2:That is exactly what I think too. The Republican party is old school so it fits very nicely! agent_1:There have been a total of 19 Republican presidents...the most of any party! agent_2:Wow, I didn't know that. Yes, the Republicans dominated politics nationally between 1860 and 1932! 	agent_1:They always emphasize their abortion position, which all stemmed from the monumental Roe vs Wade 1973 Supreme Court Ruling.	agent_2 dislikes politics. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'politics', 'no'].
8231	agent_1:Hello there, do you follow the MLS? agent_2:I do, I  think Wayne Rooney is a great acquisition for the leage what about you? agent_1:Yeah I think it was good not only for him and his family but for the league as a whole.  agent_2:I agree, he played at great teams and his an icon of soccer for sure, but there are other great players as well like Ibrahimovich agent_1:Yeah I think that has become the new norm is for world class players to end their careers here in the US.  agent_2:There is also another great player that played before Rooney his name is Roy Wegerle,  agent_1:Yeah I guess Roy was a hell of a player.  I guess he played for 5 different english clubs during his career.  agent_2:He sure was and wat about Eddie Johnson, his been a pro since age 16, he sure has a good level of skill agent_1:Yeah Eddie Johnson and Freddi Adu were touted as being the next big things in soccer.  They both had pretty good careers but not as big as hyped up to be.  agent_2:Well its hard since there is a lot of good players out there, sometimes its just a matter of luck , did you watch the last FIFA World Cup? agent_1:Yeah I get so excited each summer the world cup comes around.  How about you?	agent_2:I did, I thought it was a great World Cup, I was rooting for Argentina but I guess France was the best team of the cup overall, I also liked how Croatia played.	agent_1 likes sports. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'basketball', 'future stars'].
6593	agent_1:Are you on Facebook by any chance? agent_2:yes , I found it interesting that mark zukerburg suffers from colorblindness  agent_1:I was not aware of that. Facebook debuted in 2004. I was not aware it had been so long. It makes me wonder how long I was on MySpace before that.   agent_2:I agree, I wonder why burger king wanted people to unfriend others  agent_1:I was not aware that they did. That's very strange. You'd think they'd rather advertise on the site since so many people are on there. Facebook makes most of it's revenue from advertisements.  agent_2:I understand that to be true also. I cant believe Iceland is using Facebook to rewrite their Constitution agent_1:That seems like a bad idea. People don't think before they type on Facebook and they're willing to be more ridiculous because they are behind a keyboard. 	agent_2:Agreed.

6000	agent_1:I love this time of year. Baseball opening day is just around the corner.  Are you a fan? agent_2:I have been to a few games, mostly New York Yankee games in the Bronx. agent_1:Well they Yankees are the most successful team of all time.  By far the most World Series wins.   agent_2:Bobby Richard on the Yankees was the only person to win a World Series MVP despite losing the series. agent_1:I can imagine that was bittersweet for him then.  Did you go to old Yankee Stadium or the new one that opened in 2009? agent_2:I have been to both stadiums. I suppose I am one of the numbers that support the Yankees having the second highest attendance. agent_1:Are you a Mets fan too?  I know they are not as popular as the Yankees but they have a big following too agent_2:I am definitely a bigger fan of the Mets. I like underdog stories. I never knew in 1974 they shared Shea Stadium with the Mets. agent_1:I think the Jets and Giants played at Shea at some point to.  Lots of work for the groundskeepers agent_2:I bet. It was around the same time in 1973 that two Yankee pitchers swapped families permanently. How unusual. agent_1:Probably the strangest baseball trade in MLB history.   agent_2:Haha that is very good. Speaking of strange the Ottoman Empire was still in existence the last time the Chicago cubs won the world series. agent_1:The Ottoman empire was in existence in 2016?  That does not seem accurate.  agent_2:I think it was the World Series won before 2016. Because according the the facts the Chicago Cubs were the first baseball team to win back to back world series and haven't won since, with exception to 2016. agent_1:I have to respect Cubs fans for sticking with the team for 100 years of losing agent_2:Baseball is all about tradition. That is probably why a married couple scheduled all 2430 major league games up until 2005. agent_1:Can you imagine the planning and cost that would go into that?	agent_2:They were great at managing it. I never heard of any mistakes. Speaking of managers. Baseball managers wear uniforms because they are techincally able to play.	agent_1 dislikes job. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['job', 'sports', 'sports'].
4762	agent_1:It is amazing how a certain scent can ellict specific memories from throughout your life isn't it? agent_2:I know, I can catch a faint smell of something and be reminded of something from 20 years ago. agent_1:Yes, like a summer rain always reminds me of walking through the woods as a boy.  It's too bad we can't replicate those scents and be reminded of our childhood all of the time. agent_2:I've never thought about it, but I suppose we don't have names for smells, just where it comes from. agent_1:That's true I refer to a damp basement smell as moldy but why not refer to the smell of onions as 'yuk'? agent_2:It's difficult to imagine having names for each smell, as we have for colors.  I'd think there were too many. agent_1:Yes, but imagine if the defining term could relate to the listener not only what the smell was precisely but perhaps even it's location. Maybe other languages allow for more descriptive labels. agent_2:I suppose if you have to survive, partially because of your nose, it makes sense to be very specific. agent_1:I would think so. I suppose it has validity to convey something with just one word that lets everyone know everything about it. I think it might be difficult if you were to use a smell word with someone who had never smelled that scent before. agent_2:The Semaq Beri speakers take it seriously, especially with the brother and sister thing.  They'd struggle in the city. agent_1:Ha! They would indeed. It is funny how different cultures have taboos that make no sense to anyone but them. Whenever I smell a certain perfume I find myself back in time to my school days and the girl I used to love. agent_2:I guess we have the ability to use our noses in the same way, we just don't have the need.  There's not the peril for us. agent_1:True. Not many wild predators around to threaten us. It might be interesting to know their names for smells and try to correlate them into our culture, would they mean the same or not.	agent_2:It seems it very specific to what you do, like the difference between horticulturists and hunter-gatherers.	agent_1 dislikes hobby. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobby', 'scent', 'scent'].

Its been around since 1700 agent_2:There are pianos everywhere.  There was even one on the Hindenburg.   agent_1:Wow, thats nuts.  Did you know there are aluminum pianos? agent_2:I heard they weigh 356 pounds.  Seems like a lot but pretty light for a piano. agent_1:Yes for airships. agent_2:I wonder if those are also at the top of mountains, like the one in Britain? agent_1:I heard about that in 2006 when climbers found it agent_2:I wonder how it got there.  I mean it is not like they are small... agent_1:Had to be helicoptered up I am sure.   agent_2:Definitely not carrying that up in my pack, even if my girlfriend insists on taking it with us. agent_1:Amazing sound though from strings being struck by hammers. agent_2:Yeah, tons of intricate parts.  Did you hear that Freddie Mercury and Paul McCartney both recorded some of their famous music on the same piano? agent_1:Yes, hey jude was performed and recorded with that piano agent_2:Such talented musicians, the both of them.  I would have loved to see Freddie in concert! agent_1:Yes nothing like live music in front of an audience. agent_2:Not like the one concert Pink Floyd recorded Live, no audience! agent_1:Wow, at the amphitheater I hear.   agent_2:In Pompeii at that!

9376	agent_1:Hello, do you follow politics? agent_2:Hi, it's hard not to these days with everything going on in the news. agent_1:I agree. Did you know there hasn't been a president who wasn't a republican or democrat since 1853? agent_2:Wow I did not know it has been that long. I really think Bernie should run as an independent and not as democrat. The fear is always splitting the vote, but that happens anyway. agent_1:Yep that's true. Every president with a beard has always been a republican. agent_2:Really? I guess you're right. Of course the gop used to be completely different than the mess they are today. Only recently I discovered GOP stands for grand old party... agent_1:Oh wow I didn't know it stood for that either. The last time a republican was elected president without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was back in 1928. agent_2:Crazy, although I don't think there will be a Bush in 2020. Did you know when Hillary was in college she was president of young republicans? agent_1:That's hilarious. I did not know that about her.  agent_2:Yeah, the Republican party was a lot different more recently than people think. In fact Nixon was the only president ever to propose a guaranteed min income. Now people would probably like to reduce min wage to $2 an hour or something crazy.  agent_1:Oh wow I didn't know that either. I saw the red and blue colors associated with each party didn't start until 2000. agent_2:That is crazy. So recently yet it feels like they've always been that way. I think they should change the voting system so the popular vote counts for more. agent_1:Yea I'm not too sure what would work these days for the election.  agent_2:Elections are a mess, not just presidential. A dog has not only won an election for mayor but served as a mayor for 13 years! Dogs don't even live much past 13 lol. agent_1:I agree. LOL - that's pretty funny! During the 2012 US elections, international observers were blocked from the polls in nine states. agent_2:I can only imagine what 2020 is going to be like. Hopefully by then they start allowing you to vote online. I can't imagine it would be that hard. In Oregon elections are done by mail. Online would be a natural progression. agent_1:I agree. Since 1900, the taller candidate has won the election by 75%.	agent_2:I guess if you're short it's barely worth running.

11617	agent_1:Do you like to read? agent_2:I do like to read. Mostly mystery thrillers and sci-fi. How bout yourself? agent_1:I do, mostly non fiction books, there are also great books about trees, they might sound boring but they can be really interesting	agent_2:I don't know if I could ever just read about about trees. I could read a book that was more about the Earth as a whole. The cosmos are fascinating.	agent_1 dislikes books. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['books', 'hobby', 'reading'].
1625	agent_1:hi, do you like johnny depp? agent_2:Hi, how are you? Who is Johnny Depp? A singer? An athlete? agent_1:He is an actor. He is the one that directed the movie The Brave, if you have seen it agent_2:I have not seen it. Is it about brave people or an Indian brave? Is he an American Indian? agent_1:I think he might be partly american indigenous. I am not sure though. agent_2:Is he pretty ethnic? I think he'd have to be pretty ethnic to pull that off. Not like Elvis. Was Johnny a friend of Nic Cage? agent_1:He might be I am not sure. He even adopted the one eyed horse that was in the movie saleepy hollow agent_2:A one-eyed horse? That sounds odd. What is so charming about Cyclops the Horse? I guess you would have to put an eyepatch over one of the eyes. agent_1:They were going to put the horse down so he wanted to save it agent_2:I guess he had a place for keeping horses. Do you know much about government? I am not a fan of government. It seems like a useful invention, much like a one-eyed horse. agent_1:Me either but I do find it strange that the govnerment owns 86% of the land in Nevada agent_2:I figure the gov't must be up to something in that Nevada desert. War games? Alien spaceports? agent_1:I have no idea they are certainly using it for something. Did you ever play nintendo? agent_2:I played a bit. I warn't into them games. I had other chores to attend to on the farm/prison where I growed up. You? Did you play them games? agent_1:Sounds rough. Do you know about wikileaks? agent_2:I applied for a job there, but they didn't hire me. Said my background wasn't suspicious enough.  agent_1:Hahhaha that is funny. did you know they figured out the government is trying to destroy them	agent_2:Well, they are Wikileaks, so they have a list of enemies pretty long. 	agent_1 likes news. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['news', 'pets', 'horse'].

I'd want a whole lot more than that! agent_2:ok, yes that's what I read... and somebody needs to explain to me, how using a surrogate really works... agent_1:Simple explanation:  They take egg from mom, Sperm from dad - put it together and then into another person.	agent_2:ok... why are they doing that ?

The movie about Hans Solo just came out on Netflix.  agent_1:Is that the one where its about a young Han Solo? agent_2:Yeah it is the one, so Han Solo is not played by Harrison Ford, does it affect your opinion of the movie ? agent_1:Someone else can fill Harrison Fords shoes? Maybe ill check into how well this Alden guy does in the role agent_2:He did a good job, but Han Solo was already young in the 1977 movie, I think it impacted negatively the movie.  agent_1:Does Chewbacca appear in this movie? agent_2:Yes it does, but it is not the same actor who did the other movies. I don't think that matters too much.  agent_1:I like their relationshop in the movies. Chewy is a very loyal friend agent_2:In the canon Chewy has a family a wife and 2 sons.  agent_1:Thats interesting. I heard George RR Martin had an illustration that Chewie is based off of agent_2:I heard that too, it was on the cover of one of his small stories. It is a peculiar creature when you think about it.  agent_1:I wonder what other crazy creatures we could have had in space with Martins help. There's a giant fictional Universe that could be filled. agent_2:Would you like to  see a film with Chewbacca as the principal character ?  agent_1:I think it would be interesting. There are also so many comic stories that could be told. I just wonder how communication would work in such a movie agent_2:They would use subtitles. And good storytelling, like how Hans Solo seems to understand Chewie's intentions, but not his words. 	agent_1:Yeah its like having a dog as a best friend.

What about you? agent_1:Even Michael jackson took deep interest in robots. agent_2:Robots can be made to look human or not, which do you prefer?  I don't really mind them taking human form but in the end they are just machines. agent_1:I know so I am not sure why the need for them to look like humans agent_2:Apparently Boston Dynamics is making a 4 legged dog robot named SpotMini, so now they are creating a market for pet robots too. agent_1:cool. they have trained robots to debone a chicekn with surgical precision agent_2:There are clips on YouTube about SpotMini.  It is a bit special since it is not wheeled it can move across all kinds of terrain, agent_1:That is so cool maybe I should check it out to see what it is all about agent_2:That is the joy of computers because we can access all this information.  And now they are controlling all kinds of industrial and consumer devices! agent_1:True. the us military uses xbox 30  controllers to control theur eod robots agent_2:That is awesome.  I believe that robotics can help those who are handicapped, for instance a robotic arm a person could control with their thoughts.	agent_1:Exactly.

I just saw that Carol Burnett was the first celebrity to appear on the childrens series sesame street agent_2:That is quite a bit different than American fantasy drama series Game of Thrones! agent_1:ethiopia has a celebrity tv chef who believes he can combat his country's hunger problems by encouraging everyone to eat more diverse foods agent_2:Perhaps he could join the cast of Game of Thrones, since they film in Croatia, Malta and all over the world!	agent_1:I just saw that Charlie Chaplins granddaughter plays talisa maegry in game of thrones	agent_2 likes TV show. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV show', 'TV series', 'TV shows'].
2113	agent_2:No I didn't know that either. I wonder if other animals can do that? Like can we Harvest Pig ribs for food and then they will regrow that way we don't have to kill the pig haha agent_1:That would be awesome! I'm sure science will figure that out someday! We can already use our current technology to date the extinction of ground sloths and determine where ancient human footprints led to. agent_2:That's really cool. I would love to see that. They should put that in the movie! I think it's cool that humans are adapted for persistence running. We are some of the best animals in the world at it agent_1:Haha yea that would be cool. That's really surprising humans are the best at persistence running! I wouldn't have guessed that. As long as those pesky hiccups don't attack while running! Darn evolution leftovers! agent_2:Haha yep hiccups are so annoying! So is that frequency that causes fear in humans ,have you heard about that LOL? agent_1:No, I had not. So fear comes from sound...? I thought it had to do with the autonomic nervous system, fight or flight thing? That would be really interesting to look into further.  agent_2:Can come from sound. And yes I'm going to look into that further as well. Do you like any animals by the way? agent_1:I used to own two cats, no current pets though. I would love to go to Japan and play with some cats at a cat cafe though! haha	agent_2:Haha that does seem like a great idea! Get a drink and pet a cat LOL. Did you know that a cat will spend 10 years of its life sleeping when it's only 15 years old LOL that's a long time	agent_1 likes pets. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['pets', 'history', 'prehistoric animals'].
5999	agent_1:I love this time of year. Baseball opening day is just around the corner.  Are you a fan? agent_2:I have been to a few games, mostly New York Yankee games in the Bronx. agent_1:Well they Yankees are the most successful team of all time.  By far the most World Series wins.   agent_2:Bobby Richard on the Yankees was the only person to win a World Series MVP despite losing the series. agent_1:I can imagine that was bittersweet for him then.  Did you go to old Yankee Stadium or the new one that opened in 2009? agent_2:I have been to both stadiums. I suppose I am one of the numbers that support the Yankees having the second highest attendance. agent_1:Are you a Mets fan too?  I know they are not as popular as the Yankees but they have a big following too agent_2:I am definitely a bigger fan of the Mets. I like underdog stories. I never knew in 1974 they shared Shea Stadium with the Mets. agent_1:I think the Jets and Giants played at Shea at some point to.  Lots of work for the groundskeepers agent_2:I bet. It was around the same time in 1973 that two Yankee pitchers swapped families permanently. How unusual. agent_1:Probably the strangest baseball trade in MLB history.   agent_2:Haha that is very good. Speaking of strange the Ottoman Empire was still in existence the last time the Chicago cubs won the world series. agent_1:The Ottoman empire was in existence in 2016?  That does not seem accurate.  agent_2:I think it was the World Series won before 2016. Because according the the facts the Chicago Cubs were the first baseball team to win back to back world series and haven't won since, with exception to 2016. agent_1:I have to respect Cubs fans for sticking with the team for 100 years of losing agent_2:Baseball is all about tradition. That is probably why a married couple scheduled all 2430 major league games up until 2005.	agent_1:Can you imagine the planning and cost that would go into that?	agent_2 dislikes wedding. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['wedding', 'sports', 'stadium'].
380	agent_1:Good Morning! How are you today? agent_2:Well, you may be on the other side of the fence but I like neither Kanye nor Trump. agent_1:I couldn't have said it any better lol. That was such an odd meeting between them two a couple months ago! agent_2:I recall the time that Kanye stood up to a President when he perceived racism, now he seems to have flipped.  I guess they money makes a big difference, agent_1:A very big difference. He even thinks AIDS is a man-made disease! agent_2:People love a good conspiracy story.  I think that is how Trump does so well, people believe in the Deep State, and such. agent_1:I agree! What kind of music do you like to listen to?	agent_2:I'm a kid of the eighties and nineties,  I never really moved on from that alternative rock scene.	agent_1 dislikes music. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'work', 'meeting with the boss'].
1112	agent_1:No. I think it's so interesting that the Republican Party is referred to as the Grand old party. agent_2:I agree.  I wonder why they gave themselves that moniker.   agent_1:Yeah I'm not sure. But every US president with a beard has been Republican. agent_2:True.  I also heard that Hillary Clinton was president of the young republicans when she was in college. agent_1:Oh that's interesting especially given the fact that she just ran Democrat. The red and blue colors for Republicans and Democrats only started in 2000. agent_2:That really got me.  I thought they were always around representing the parties.   agent_1:Yeah me too but it sounds like they used to use animals more. Truman seem to take that very seriously especially at Disneyland. agent_2:I heard... poor Dumbo.  He probably didnt even understand. agent_1:Ha ha yeah I bet he was so confused. It's funny to think that ride has been around since 1957. agent_2:It really is, it was my favorite as a kid, much to the detriment of my parents.  LOL agent_1:Haha thats funny. Apparently officials in ancient athens were appointed by lottery because they believe elections would lead to oligarchy. agent_2:Well elections also lead to a dog being elected mayor... so I dont know what is worse. agent_1:Haha yes good point. I hope that one day the voter turnout for presidential elections will breach 63%. agent_2:Me too.  Did you know the faster blinker has lost every election since 1980.  Who even calculates that data. agent_1:Yeah that is definitely an odd stat. agent_2:There is even a cat that placed 3rd in the Virginia Senate election.  How can animals even run?  That is just crazy agent_1:Haha i guess you can vote for anything. Like blinking, another odd stat is the tallest candidate has won in 75% of elections.	agent_2:So we need to look for a slow blinker and a tall person for 2020.	agent_1 likes holiday. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['holiday', 'theme park', 'ride'].
12394	agent_1:Hi, how are you? agent_2:Fine. What about you ? agent_1:I'm good, thanks for asking.  Do you like horses? agent_2:Yes. Horses species are evolved over 40 to 55 million years ago. Human domesticated horses for many purpose like travelling and carrying goods. agent_1:I like horses too!  I hear that the only true wild horses are the Przewalski's horse.  Did you know that? agent_2:Its very interesting. Horses mainly used in riding, agriculture and competition purpose. In olden days it is used in warfare and travelling. It speedy escaped from its predators. agent_1:Yes, I agree with you about that!  On a side note, do you know that there are about 20 quintillion animals on planet Earth? agent_2:Iceland horses have fifth speed, they are basically speed walking horses it very difficult to run in ice. agent_1:That's funny, I've seen those little horses and they are too cute! agent_2:They are pony. When they are big use it for riding. Lipizzaner horses, known for their classical performances. agent_1:Speaking of the Lipizzaner horses, did you know it takes about 6 years for them to turn white?  They are either born totally brown or black. agent_2:Now days, cops are using horses it is very amazing to see it. agent_1:Yes, it is. I read that there is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans. agent_2:Germany became first country in the world to constitutionally guaranteed legal rights. agent_1:That's right.  Did you know under the 1912 Scottish protection of animals act, The Loch Ness monster is a protected species? agent_2:If destroy any species can cause the breaking in the food web. It affect the eco-system very much so only the government take steps to protect them. we should also try to protect it. agent_1:Yes, we all have a responsibility to help keep the animals safe. agent_2:We should plant trees also it provide space for birds also.	agent_1:So true, my friend!  It has been estimated that there are over 7 million different animal species on Earth!	agent_2 likes animals. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['animals', 'cute animals', 'health'].

Some people are saying the last jedi underpeformed agent_2:I don't agree with... I liked it a lot! agent_1:We'll just have to hope episode 9 shuts everyone up agent_2:I am sure of it!  That's funny George lucas's wife won an acedemy award agent_1:I know and george lucas didnt! But she did have an influence on vital scenes. Including obi wan's death agent_2:Yeah i know, but still :)  That's cool, that they dubbed it in navajo language agent_1:I wonder if they still had james earl jones. You cant change vader's voice! agent_2:Not really sure! and i soooo agree! agent_1:I think 8.5 billion total revenue makes all the movies pretty successful agent_2:WOW... that's a lot of money!  Love how fox lost billions because they didn't believe in the franchise! agent_1:It make Lucas a billionaire! The value of the franchise is 65 billion agent_2:Whoaaaaa!  chaching!  You see some of the star wars are on Netflix? agent_1:Yeah, I need to check out Solo. I havent watched that yet. Heard that also was received poorly agent_2:I am sure it is great!  These people are just haters... especially since Disney bought the franchise!	agent_1:We can all agree that Luke Skywalker is the man though!

12697	"agent_1:I am not a fan of Mitch McConnell.  The senate majority leader has gone somewhat nuts. agent_2:Good afternoon, I try to avoid the political shenanigans.  It's just one shyster trying to get something over on the other guy, all the time.   agent_1:Yes but even in 2016 the CIA was meeting with senior congressional leaders over the fact that Putin had authorized an operation to destabilize our election agent_2:That's Putin for you, he's going to do that, hard to believe it took the CIA needing to tell them he was doing it.  I'm sure all of our ""frenemies""  do the same thing and we do it to them, too. agent_1:Yes but it is scary that McConnell is denying the evidence and claiming that it is just a scheme by the CIA to discredit Trump.  He does not believe all of our national security agencies."	agent_2:On a different and much happier note than all that crazy political mess, do you realize the consistent use of the red and blue colors for Republicans and Democrats only started in 2000?  That's probably about the time it started to get real ugly in politics.	agent_1 dislikes politics. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'politics', 'no'].
2700	agent_1:Do you own a pet snake? agent_2:No but there are some snakes outside around where I live at. agent_1:They are considered legless lizards. I like lizards but not snakes agent_2:What is your favorite type of lizard? agent_1:Iguana by far. I almost bought a baby one yesterday. I was looking at Chameleons too agent_2:Would you ever consider owning a larger one like a crocodile? agent_1:Heck no. They are illegal too, aren't they? agent_2:Oh I didn't realize they were illegal to own. agent_1:They are more closely related to birds and I only like parrots for birds, and the bald eagle of course agent_2:Do you like Taylor Swift? agent_1:I do, kinda. I like her as a person. She seems humble and very likeable agent_2:Yea, she also walks backwards around paparazzi. agent_1:She was born and raised close to where I grew up in Pennslyvania too agent_2:Do you know about the Tennessee state?	agent_1:Not too much.

By the time they're 15, cats have spent about 10 years of their lives sleeping agent_1:Sorry, to hear that.  I have had a cat, she passed away last year and she was 18 years old.  I believe she probably slept 16 out of those 18 years sleeping. lol agent_2:I didn't realize that they sleep so much or that there are over 70 breeds! agent_1:My cat was probably the easiest low maintenance pet I ever had,  A lot less needy than my dogs, for sure. Do own any pets?	agent_2:The only pet I've ever had are fish, though I don't mind cats. I had a friend in college who wants to open her own cat cafe like they have in Japan and Taiwan	agent_1 likes pets. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['pets', 'cats', 'greeting'].
11119	"agent_1:Do you read much poetry? agent_2:I do sometimes. What about you though? I do read a lot of old Epic tales like the Epic of Gilgamesh agent_1:I've never read that one. It sounds fascinating though. I read more classics like the Iliad.  agent_2:Yes I read that too. They're very interesting I think. We should put more effort to read those kinds of books in our school system agent_1:I totally agree. Poetry and its word choices and writing structure makes it something that encourages creativity.  agent_2:Yes and the interesting thing about the word poetry is that it drives from a Greek term, the term is poesis which means making agent_1:That makes sense since when it comes to poetry you are definitely making something. I don't think it is as appreciated as a writing form as it could be.  agent_2:Yes I agree. No one really writes poetry anymore. It's interesting how in Javanese, the alphabet will form a phone when it is read in order agent_1:Oh that's really neat. I love when poems do cool things like that. Like the depressing poem that you are meant to read backwards so it becomes a happy one.  agent_2:Yes I'll have to check that out. It makes me sad that Edgar Allan Poe only got $9 for the poem ""The Raven"" that's actually a really amazing poem agent_1:You would think that his family estate is getting royalties on that. I bet the person that paid him so little was kicking themselves when he became popular.  agent_2:Yes I agree. Did you hear about the 224 palindrome poem? It was created by Demetri Martin, that sounds interesting"	agent_1:224! That is a huge amount of palindromes. I'm not even sure I can think of that many let alone that many sentences that could be palindromes.

7296	agent_2:yes. The actors in the exorcist never knew that they were making a horror film. lol agent_1:It's crazy, I think a lot of people are like that in real life too, I wish more people would realize that it could be us like that. Isn't it nuts that a single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving reality and fantasy?  agent_2:Thats deep. People could learn more about this at an actual university agent_1:They could, too bad not everyone has access to a university though, would help everyone out a lot if it was more profitable, the inequality gap in the US is getting ridiculous! agent_2:Did you ever see Thor that came out in 2011 ? agent_1:I did, I remember watching it in the movie theater, it's the fourth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Loki seems like a bad guy you can root for, or am I mistaken? agent_2:I have never seen it. I do like Chris Hemsworth agent_1:Yah he is a good actor, I like Natallie Portman and Tom HIddleston too, both great actors and actresses!	agent_2:I agree but Idris Elba and Anthony Hopkins are the best	agent_1 likes movie. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'books', 'book genre'].

But it seems like a cool show, what channel is it on?  agent_2:It's on Discovery Channel. It's a yearly event they have with all different sorts of shows that they air. agent_1:I don't think I have that channel. Did you know sharks rescue sailors?  agent_2:I never knew that, I only thought it was dolphins that did that. That is an interesting behavior for a predator. agent_1:It sort of sounds not real to me. 	agent_2:Yeah I kind of have a hard time believing it as well. I like watching some of the crazy movies they have made about sharks like The Meg or Sharknado as well.	agent_1 likes movie. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'animals', 'dolphin behavior'].
8406	agent_1:hey there, do you like movies? agent_2:I do. I actually saw 50 Shades of Grey with a friend for Valentine's Day in IMAX. agent_1:that was a huge box office hit. do you know who is the highest all time box star? agent_2:No, who is it? agent_1:tom hanks, and I am not surprised he is a good actor agent_2:He is very likable and doesn't take on bad roles, so he should be one of the top earners, even though less skilled actors can manage to do pretty well. agent_1:that is very true. his movies seem to always have a good morale about them agent_2:Do you think he would have brought anything to the table in an action film like Wonder Woman? agent_1:oh for sure, wonder woman is the highest grossing superhero origin movie agent_2:I'd like to see more female-led movies top the box office, how about you? agent_1:me too. I am excited and looking forward to wonder woman 2 agent_2:I think it's interesting that the prequels that were released as follow-ups to the Original Star Wars weren't as profitable agent_1:I know, I guess everyone just really loved the trilogy  agent_2:I'm glad there won't be another trilogy of 50 Shades of Garbage movies haha agent_1:Oh yes, no thank you, I do not see the point of that. did you know that Gal Gadot who plays wonder woman served in the israeli defense forces? agent_2:It's always nice to see someone bring some street cred to their art by having real life experience, right? agent_1:of course. and she did not even know she was auditioning for wonder woman	agent_2:That's pretty crazy!

Tom hanks is the highest box office star! agent_2:I love him, he's such a versatile actor and has played in some of my favorite movies.  Did you know Disney thought about shutting down their studio after Sleeping beauty flopped at the box office?	agent_1:Yikes, was it that bad?  I have only seen it like once or twice lol.

They say that watching horror movies can burn up more than 180 calories! agent_1:Haha that's funny! If you watch a horror movie before you look at abstract art, you will enjoy the art more apparently. agent_2:That's interesting. Did you know Danny from The Shining did not know he was acting in a horror film until several years later. agent_1:Oh wow I didn't know that. Pretty interesting he didn't know.  agent_2:I've always wondered if they tell young kids what kind of movie they're in while filming. Did you know that Stephen King was terrified when he saw ""Bambi"" as a child? agent_1:I saw that - pretty funny he was scared of Bambi. Do you use Google? agent_2:I do, it's like my best friend. I ask it everything.  agent_1:Haha same here. A single Google search requires more computing power than it took to send astronauts to the moon. agent_2:That's crazy how far technology has came. I heard that Google maps calculates traffic by tracking how fast Android devices are moving on the road. agent_1:Wow that's amazing. Google maps will tailor its maps whenever there is a disputed border.  agent_2:That's pretty neat. I wish I worked at their headquarters.

Certainly not Fox.  agent_1:Did you know that CNN recently raised concern about Fox & Friends? agent_2:I had heard something about it. Weren't they concerned about their interviews with Republicans? agent_1:Yes you are correct. Despite the students mourning due to a mass shooting a day earlier, Republicans appeared only a fox where they wouldn't be pressed about gun control agent_2:That's terrible. All of our press should be able to question our representatives. I think some of the people they interviewed were Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz if I remember correctly.  agent_1:All they mentioned was that it was a truly heart breaking horror and that evil is sadly always present. agent_2:We should have known it's bias since it was created by a Republican media strategist and Richard Nixon.  agent_1:I feel that most news are bias in some way or another. Too bad fox is watched more than cnn and msnbc combined. agent_2:That's sad. Apparently they even threatened to sue the Simpsons for making fun of them for their anti-democratic agenda. They wanted to stop them from continuing that.  agent_1:I mean usually its kind of funny how they threatened to sue the Simpsons over a fact which is true. I guess their perspective is a given since they were created by Richard ailes and president Richard nixon. agent_2:I agree. They would never win because of parody laws anyway. Did you know that every US president with a beard has been a Republican?! How odd.  agent_1:It seems like a strange coincidence?  agent_2:Ha ha. Maybe. Unsurprisingly, there has not been a president that was not a democrat or republican since 1853.  agent_1:Well I believe either Roosevelt or JFK came very close as a uncorrelated 3rd party.	agent_2:You may be correct.

I think I will enjoy it. All the cover-ups! agent_1:I agree, theres a lot of interesting stories in her memoirs, like anecdotes about ''The Post'', ''The Iron Lady'', I might buy it and pick it as my next audiobook	agent_2:Thats good.

He seems like a very intelligent man. agent_1:He was an amazing writer and his novels really changed American literature.  agent_2:I've never been much for reading other than college text books and professional books (for my profession). agent_1:what profession? does that get boring?	agent_2:I'm a teacher.

I fell in love with it when Edgar allen poe wrote about it. agent_2:He wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg, correct? That is awesome! Fiction is derived from the imagination and Poe had a great imagination! agent_1:Yeah. I liked Poe. Tell Tale Heart scared the heck out of me!	agent_2:So true!

2538	agent_1:Hello, are you a big Netflix person? agent_2:I am!  I have been a subscriber for years and especially love the original content! agent_1:I do as well! Were you a subscriber even back when their whole business model was about DVD rental by mail and not an online platform? agent_2:I was! I think it was in 2007 when they started adding streaming features. agent_1:It's interesting to think how differently the company could have been if decisions played out differently. Like Blockbuster declining to buy them many times, and now they're worth many times over. agent_2:Exactly! A purchase of $50 million that is now worth $2 billion. That is just CRAZY! agent_1:And I feel like that doesn't even big to desribe how huge Netflix is still. Netflix accounts for a third of ALL bandwith in North America from 9pm to 12 am! agent_2:Which is honestly just nuts. And when you combine Netflix and youtube, it's half of the peak internet traffic in North America alone! agent_1:I was surprised to learn recently though, that despite how huge their online platform is, they still do DVD rentals! And spend 20 times more on postage than their bandwith. agent_2:True - but I think they might need to start paying more attention to what they are spending - they racked up $21.9 billion in debt as of Sept 2017 trying to get content! agent_1:That's certainly a lot of money! Although at least it's an investment and will come back to them. On the other hand, I remember a decade ago, Tom Cruise spent $10 million on an underground bunker to protect himself from aliens, what a nut. agent_2:I stopped liking him when he went all about Scientology. I much prefer other actors now, like Peter Dinklage. agent_1:I've never heard of him, does he do a lot of action movies? I like Tom Cruise because of movies like Top Gun and Cocktail but I'm always interested in expanding my preferences. agent_2:Actually, Peter Dinklage plays Tyrion Lannister on Game of Thrones!  agent_1:Oh wow! That's a beautiful show I've been meaning to watch, it's filmed in Ireland I think! And from the limited parts I've seen the scenery is gorgeous.	agent_2:Yes.

9563	agent_1:Hi, how are you? Do you like to use the Internet? agent_2:Hey. Yes I love the Internet. They carry so much information and resources and services. agent_1:i worry about the internet. i think that it could be addictive and that i might lose myself in it. the clicking, the constant clicking. agent_2:That is definitely a valid concern. What is weird is that humans are the minority on the Internet outnumbered by automated software programs. agent_1:i did not know that. we are monitored all the time. even these very chats that we do could be handled by bots in the future. then what? agent_2:Yes that's a good question I'm not sure what would happen then. One cool thing is that in Finland everyone has the right to an Internet connection. agent_1:i think that is great. people need to be connected for work and school and also to make friends. maybe not bot friends though. agent_2:Agreed. When people look themselves up on the internet it is called egosurfing. I wonder if bots egosurf lol? agent_1:that would be funny. comparing themselves to other bots. the narcissstic bot. that would be their downfall agent_2:Yeah it would! What is crazy is that astronauts in space have faster internet than most american homes! agent_1:that would make sense to me. i guess they need a speedy link to send and receive data. do you believe in extraterrestrials? agent_2:Yeah true. I do although we have never made contact. Even the ancient greeks wrote stories about them! agent_1:i guess the skies seemed mysterious to them too. what is up there past the stars? they must have wondered. i figure that one day we will make contact, but not the way we expect. agent_2:Yeah I don't think we will. The president of the world chess federation believe chess was invented by aliens. That is certainly an odd theory lol. agent_1:why aliens? it is not such a strange game. simple pieces, simple board, simple moves. complex strategy. agent_2:Yes my thoughts precisely. Well at least we are prepared. The UN has a contingency plan just in case! agent_1:I dont have too much faith in that. the UN doesnt speak alien. And they would probably protect themselves. agent_2:Yeah agreed. Maybe the USA needs its own plan? The sequel to charlie and the chocolate factory has aliens! agent_1:What? that is strange. Aliens in a chocolate factory? Why? I guess the kids like aliens? Why not zombies? Anyway, great chat! agent_2:Haha yes I question that same thing. They are all hypothetical life forms indeed.

It is the only one without a God/Goddess name. agent_2:I saw that in 1975 the Soviet Union sent a spacecraft to Venus. agent_1:Wow, maybe that is how they found out it doesnt tilt/ agent_2:You can fit every other planet between Earth and the moon/ agent_1:Wow, I didnt realize it was really that far away.  Does that include pluto, they can't decide about that poor planet. agent_2:I believe it does. There is a planet that orbits four stars. agent_1:There is a planet where shards of glass rain sideways at 4500 mph in 2000 degree F weather.  No thanks. agent_2:That's crazy! Manned space stations orbit Jupiter are impossible due to the intense radiation. agent_1:I would imagine.  I have heard there are pretty violent storms on Jupiter. agent_2:I've heard that too. Even heard you can pick up the strong storms on Earth over radios agent_1:Jupiter has a moon that could be considered a planet if it orbited the sun. agent_2:Wow that's crazy. Do you know much about governors?	agent_1:Some, I know Schwarzenegger never lived in Sacramento, he commuted daily by private jet.	agent_2 likes movie. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'astronomy', 'planet'].

So does Clint Eastwood apparently. agent_2:Yeah, he plays piano. he also composes too, ive heard. agent_1:I didn't know that. That is pretty cool.  agent_2:He is allergic to horses, i think, so maybe he spends more time at the piano now. agent_1:Interesting, I wonder how he shot all of those films then?  agent_2:I think he wasnt allergic at first, but then developed an allergy. maybe he is getting treatment now? i dont know agent_1:Interesting. Who would have guessed?  agent_2:I wonder if clint knows that Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts. agent_1:I'm not sure, but that is a good question.

250	"agent_1:I think its sad to have to part with a pet due to allergies and couple conflict like in the Dear Amy section. agent_2:That is sad. Do you have pets? The first cloned pet was a cat and its name was copy cat. agent_1:Yes, I have a dog.  Sounds like in the Dear Amy that they do everything tit for tat. The cat owner states that her fiance has to get rid of his saltwater fish if she gets rid of her cat.  That's not necessarily fair though I don't think.  They seem like they may struggle as a couple in the future. agent_2:Yeah that's a bit dramatic! A cat lover is known as an ailurophile and a dog lover is known as a cynophile. agent_1:Allergies can be serious to people.  I understand his reserve of having a cat. agent_2:Me too. A pet or companion animal is an animal kept primarily for a person's company, protection, or entertainment. No one should have to be made uncomfortable by a pet in the house. agent_1:I'm sure she loves the pet, but she has to make a choice if the pet is harming her fiance. agent_2:Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described. I'm sure they can find one to agree on.  agent_1:Did you ever hear that animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated?  That's a new one to me.   agent_2:That's interesting! Of the 1.5 million species, 1 million are insects! Yuck! agent_1:Apparently, there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.  If you want to live forever, you can look into being a jellyfish. agent_2:Fascinating! In japan, there are more pets than there are children under 15. agent_1:Teddy Roosevelt had over 20 pets and his own real ""teddy"" bear along with a hyena agent_2:Wow! There are more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia. agent_1:I never met anyone with a tiger pet.  That is strange.  It's not legal to own pets in Boulder, Colorado but you can be their guardian. agent_2:Lots of places have special animal rights. In 2002, germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights. agent_1:The loch ness monster is protected by 1912 Scottish provisions agent_2:That's funny. It's not even a proven species. There are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth. agent_1:Did you ever hear of people being contacted due to DNA matches?  You can opt in or out but might be connected with matches of family members agent_2:That is pretty cool.

Are you familiar with K-pop? agent_2:I'm kind of familiar with it. agent_1:Me too. There are several songs that stick in my head It's catchy. There is a K-pop band called Moranbong Band that is the most popular music group in the country. I am not familiar with their music.  agent_2:I've never heard of them before. I heard that rejection letters from Sub Pop Records to aspiring artists start with ""Dear loser."" That's kind of disheartening. agent_1:Wow! I new they were an edgy company but that's harsh. Did you know that Ricky Gervais was a pop singer in the 80's? I cannot picture that.  agent_2:I've heard that and I can't believe it. I'm glad he stuck with comedy instead of that. agent_1:Me too. Do you like to attend concerts? agent_2:I do, I'm actually attending one next weekend. I wish I could have been at the Foo Fighters concert that was so loud it showed up on New Zealand's seismic monitors! agent_1:I didn't know that happened. I do love the Foo Fighters though. Did you know that in 2001 Linkin Park played 324 concerts because their album was so successful? agent_2:Oh wow, that's alot of concerts. That album is one of my favorites. Have you heard about Deep Purple breaking the record for the loudest concert in 1972? Three audience members were rendered unconscious! agent_1:I did not. That seems excessive to me. I'm surprised Deep Purple would be the ones to play a concert that loud. Did you know that The Ramones played 2,263 concerts over the span of their career? agent_2:That's a lot of concerts! Wow. Did you know that Abba turned down $1 BILLION to do a 100 concert reunion tour? agent_1:I did not. Wow! They must still have a lot of money saved to be able to turn that down. I don't like to laugh at the misfortune of others but I find it amusing that concert attendees filed a lawsuit against Creed because their concert was so bad.  agent_2:That is pretty funny. It must have been towards then end of Creed. "	agent_1:I would assume so. I also recently learned that Pink Floyd held a concert in 1972 with no audience. I wonder why they did that?

Have you ever heard of their unwritten rules such as if you hit one of our we'll hit one of yours? agent_1:Well, Yes and yes. I do not like the unwritten rules. Seems too unfun... Do you like them? agent_2:Some of them seem more like common sense to me.  I mean, not bringing a pet to the batting cage for one makes sense. agent_1:That one does make sense. Mine are more like, pimp your HR trot. Go ahead. Ill be better next time... agent_2:I like the unwritten rule of don't eat baked beans before a double header and don't order out for sushi during a rain delay. agent_1:I understand the baked beans, that's common courtesy... But what's wrong with sushi? agent_2:I don't know, maybe they think the guy will get sick or something.  The players do do some running to bases and maybe they think that'll slow them down. agent_1:Makes sense. I do hate the rule about stealing when you are down or trying a bunt when you are getting no-hit. agent_2:What does the rule say about those? agent_1:Don't do those things. If you are down big, you shouldn't steal. If you have not gotten a hit, you shouldn't bunt.	agent_2:I don't think I like those either.  It would seem to me you would want to steal and try to make some runs.

Did you know jazz originated in the African American communities of New Orleans in the late 19th and early 20 century. agent_2:i think I did know that.  Seems like I've seen a movie that referenced it.  Didn't they combine jazz with some brass band marches or something? agent_1:It has roots in blues and ragtime.  It is now recognized as a major form of musical expression. agent_2:I'm glad.  It's world wide now too.  Pakistan has a jazz orchestra! agent_1:Cool jazz actually originated in the 1940s. It introduced calmer smoother sounds and long linear melodic lines you hear in todays jazz. agent_2:i like that. There's a lot of good music from the 40s. agent_1:Were you aware that Clint Eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast. agent_2:No I wasn't.  i guess going by the characters he plays in movies I just never made the connection. agent_1:Oh he is a big fan. He even scored several films including million dollar baby. That is a great movie. agent_2:He did?  What instrument does he play? agent_1:I think he played a few different instruments.

After filming the goonies steven spielberg flew the entire cast to hawaii and surprised director richard donner with a cookout. agent_2:Amazing!  Thats so nice. When steven spielberg rode jurassic park the ride on opening day he requested that he was let off before the 84 foot drop agent_1:Too funny! Speaking of entertainers that make a lot of money, With over $8.5 billion worldwide film earnings, tom hanks is the highest all-time box office star. agent_2:He is very talented. Disney considered shutting down their animation studio after sleeping beauty was a box office failure. agent_1:Good thing they didn't! Disney's ""treasure planet"" was one of the most expensive box office flops of all time. agent_2:yeah,  I read that recently,  I never saw it.  The movie trojan wars with a budget of $15,000,000 has earned only $309 in box office agent_1:Yikes! The silence of the lambs came out on valentine's day in 1991 and had a box office of over $270 million. agent_2:That movie was great and creepy at the same time.   agent_1:Super creepy. Spielberg became a household name as the director of Jaws. agent_2:Did you know that More than 80 percent of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed agent_1:That's sad. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water. agent_2:Also, When earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long.  Such short days!  i wouldnt mind going to work for only 2 hours lol  agent_1:That would be great!

Do you? agent_1:Don't have a favorite team either but my friends are huge Red Sox fans not sure if it's because they have gone on to win nine world series championships or what but with those stats, seems like a great accomplishment. agent_2:Well they have an amazing performance. Did you know Lebron James partly own the boston red sox? agent_1:Oh really? I didn't know that, that must be a great investment! Lots of fans have superstitions surrounding games, do you have any?  agent_2:Indeed. Do you like the mlb? agent_1:Not really, the only player I'm familiar with is Babe Ruth who was caught stealing to end the game and lose the world series in 1926. agent_2:Well it has its pros and cons. After a 17yr old female pitcher struck out babe ruth and lou gehrig, she was banned from pro baseball agent_1:I wonder how that banning action would fare in today's world and society, you think it would receive negative press? agent_2:I think it would. Most men sports leagues don't outright ban females. They usually just have very difficult requirement to meet for females like the nfl agent_1:Oh yeah, I heard about that. I wonder if thee were collectible cards and females did make it to play on the male dominant teams, would the cards be as valuable as other cards or extra valuable, like a man found three million dollars worth of cards in his grandfathers attic! agent_2:I guess attics are treasure troves agent_1:For some, unless its the attic of a hoarder. I wonder whether other sports team have requirements like baseball managers where they have to wear the uniforms because they have to play if the need arises. agent_2:I still haven't seen the manager ever play. Are managers bench players? agent_1:Don't think so, but some of those managers aren't in great shape to be playing on the fields, if anything, they should just forfeit the game to save the managers from embarrassment.  agent_2:True. i was surprised that if a player catches a ball in their hat, the opposing team gets 3 bases agent_1:Yeah, I have yet to see that happen on tv nor have seen anyone attempt to do that. In Japan, baseball is also considered one of its national past time by how popular it is there. agent_2:I personally don't find watching baseball games to be entertaining although I do enjoy baseball. Games here are fundamental different in atmosphere as asia	agent_1:Yeah, when you have much more physical games like football and basketball, baseball and even golf can be quite boring.

Do you know who invented the piano? agent_1:Wasn't in by Bartolomeo Cristofori around the year 1700 in Italy? agent_2:That is correct. The piano is being playing using a keyboard that has a row of keys that the pianist presses down to cause the hammers to strike the strings. agent_1:That is one interesting fact! You know what is more interesting though, how computers have come about! agent_2:I agree. Computers are more complex than pianos in my opinion because they are devices that carry sequences by computer programming. agent_1:Well said! I wish I could have used a computer that used water to run it like the Russians did! agent_2:Really!! I didn't know that the Russians did this.

Yes, I am a huge fan of Star Wars! I also loved how it was the first major movie to be dubbed in Navajo! I think that is so cool! agent_1:Yeah, that's wild. I guess it takes a pretty small audience to pay for the translation work. agent_2:Agreed. Isn't it also funny James Earl Jones only spent two and half hours recording his lines for Darth Vader? I also can't believe he was only paid $7500! Geez, that's pocket change. agent_1:$7500 is amazingly low. I guess since Darth Vader was masked Jones could just record everything at once in the studio. agent_2:Agreed. Can you also believe that George Lucas' wife at the time, Marcia, won an academy award for her editing on Star Wars and yet George Lucas didn't win an academy award for directing. That is just downright unbelievable! agent_1:A lot of people think the OT was so much better than the prequels because of her influence. agent_2:Yeah it was because of her that so many major changes were made like Leia's good luck kiss, Obi Wan's death, etc. She was truly a big influence! agent_1:I remember thinking just about everything in the prequels' timeline was off, based on the mental version of the past the OT led us to construct. But I'd have to rewatch to nail it down. agent_2:Yeah I would have to watch it as well! So are you also a fan of Chewbacca? I love him. I think it's funny there's a bat species called the Chewbacca bat. That's hilarious! agent_1:I never felt strongly about Chewbacca one way or the other TBH. But I've got to google a picture of that bat to see what it looks like! agent_2:I would like to see it as well. Did you know Chewbacca actually had a wife and two boys? That's pretty interesting! agent_1:I vaguely recall reading something in the Star Wars fictional universe where a young Han Solo stayed with Chewbacca and his mom in their home. agent_2:That's so weird, isn't it? Ha! Are you one of the fans who believes both r2d2 and Chewbacca were secret rebel agents? I kind of think it's an interesting theory.  agent_1:I wish I knew enough about the background to have an opinion, but the last Star Wars I watched was Episode III, when it came out on video. I really need to rewatch to refresh my memory of it. 	agent_2:Same here!

Maybe Wikileaks knows something about this. agent_1:That's where Area 51 is located so I'm sure there are lots of secret bases in that state. agent_2:I think Area 51 is in New Mexico, but I'm not sure. Lots of open space in Nevada.  agent_1:Oh yea you might be right lol. In 2006, the US passed a bill that would protect the government employees from being charged for violating the geneva conventions. agent_2:I think that is wrong, but probably there to protect military contractors and stuff. A lot of war going on in 2006. Probably a lot of liability.  agent_1:Yea, I was deployed to Iraq for the war back in 2005-2006 and then again in 2007. agent_2:Hm. I guess that you would be protected under the law. You made it back safe and sound I trust? The gov't has no plans to send you again? agent_1:Yes, I made it back safe and sound thankfully. I was infantry so had some close calls. No plans to deploy again. My enlisted contract ended back in 2008 so I'm finished and 33 years old now. agent_2:Your gov't service is done!

What's your favorite one that you remember? agent_2:I saw Rush a couple of times. that was great. they were so good live. agent_1:I bet! Can you believe Linkin Park did 324 concerts in 2001 alone? agent_2:I cant imagine having that much energy. they must have slept on the bus. how could they do that? agent_1:Pure adrenaline probably haha. They could have been like the Ramones touring for 20 straight years. I wonder how many concerts they put on? agent_2:Probably over 100 a year, so about 2000?  agent_1:It looks like 2263 in total! You were close! At least they weren't as bas a Creed doing concerts lol. agent_2:Is Creed a christian rock band? it sounds religious.	agent_1:They were some terrible rock group in the early 2000s.

Did you know video games were orignally used by the military?  agent_2:No I didnt, I always thought they were used for entertainment although I know the millitary use them currently agent_1:I know, it was probably for some type of war game.  agent_2:What are your thoughts on the name ''Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Devices'' ? agent_1:I play them every now and then. LOL agent_2:I think its a really long and boring name lol, I do like to play video games as well do you have a PlayStation system? agent_1:No, I used to though. I didn't like the games that were coming out on it.  agent_2:I see well I bought one and used to play fifa 14, that was the last game that came our for the PlayStation 2 model. agent_1:I used to play that too. Did you Tom Hanks brother does woody's voice in video games?  agent_2:I didnt, he has a great voice! you know that Stephen Fry is also a game narrator, he narrater the voice for some games agent_1:Yeah, I heard that. Apparently playstation 3s are being used to research blackholes.  agent_2:Wow it sounds like the consol has a lot of power, it must be cheaper than building a computer capable of doing that, the department of defense also used them to build a supercomputer, in fact 1760 units agent_1:yeah, apparently they used them to build a super computer, I wonder if they were actually playing grand theft auto! agent_2:I dont about that but something funny happened to the company, they issued and unlock code for the ps3 by accident, they were prosecuting people that did the same things before them.	agent_1:Wow, did you ever try any of the baseball games on playstation?	agent_2 likes video games. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['video games', 'favorite game', 'fifa 14'].

I even knew the married couple who scheduled all 2000+ games every year agent_1:I didnt know about them, I guessed they had a talent for that, can you imagine the time that would take! agent_2:Yes it was a lot of work.  I just wish my grandfather had saved baseball cards - one lucky man found 3 million dollars worth of them in his grandfather's attic agent_1:3 million dolars no kidding! that is awesome, what a lucky break he had, agent_2:For sure.  Wonder if baseball cards exist in Japan?  The game is really popular there as well agent_1:I bet they due, they really love the sport our there, do you have a favorite baseball team?  I like the Yankees agent_2:I am an Atlanta Braves fan but I could not help but love the Cubs when they finally won the World Series a few years ago agent_1:Yeah I bet they were really exited, they could lift that curse finally agent_2:Yes they won back to back world series and then never won again for years agent_1:Babe Ruth was caught stealing a base and then his team lost back in the year 1926 agent_2:Yeah talk about blowing the world series for your team - in game 7 even! agent_1:I know right, he still was considered a legend, things could have turn out differently if he didnt had the guts to steal that base agent_2:Yes.  baseball is not as popular as it once was though - the womens world cup had higher tv ratings than the world series agent_1:It did? Wow, that is suprising, womans sports usually dont get support at all agent_2:yes as little as foreign sports!  During the 92 series the us marines carried the canada flag into the stadium upside down! agent_1:I wonder why, do you know the reason for that? agent_2:An accident I think!  They were clueless.

11955	agent_1:Hey there. I just learned that GOP stands for Grand Old Party. Very traditional sounding. agent_2:That is exactly what I think too. The Republican party is old school so it fits very nicely! agent_1:There have been a total of 19 Republican presidents...the most of any party! agent_2:Wow, I didn't know that. Yes, the Republicans dominated politics nationally between 1860 and 1932!  agent_1:They always emphasize their abortion position, which all stemmed from the monumental Roe vs Wade 1973 Supreme Court Ruling. agent_2:Exactly. This was their platform and their support grew its evangelicals, leading to complete alignment with Christian conservatism. A lot different from the Democratic party. agent_1:Yes a stark contrast to the Democrats. The two parties heritage goes back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison's Democratic-Republican Party! agent_2:Yes, and the Republican party as of 2018 was the primary party of power in the USA.  Interesting though that there has not been a non republican / non democrat since 1853. agent_1:Yes I wish that wasn't the case. The more variety the better. 15% of the tea party movement identified as democrats!	agent_2:I agree! I think we should all be open minded and not choose a side. the red and blue colors used for republicans and democrats only started being used consistently since 2000.

10270	agent_1:I just read a section on comedy which states that the python program was partly named after Monty Python. I love how they did that! agent_2:Yeah the programming language I think is what you mean. Classic comedy. Kung Fu Hustle is a brilliant comedy also. agent_1:I've actually never seen it, whats it about?  agent_2:It's a wacky cartoony slapstick comedy. Bill Murray loves the movie too. agent_1:i'll add it to my list of movies to watch. Bill Murray is such a great comedian, unfortunately I don't think he's been in movies as of late. Green lantern is on my list of movies to watch too, weird to think that it was initially going to be a comedy agent_2:Yeah I think Jack Black was supposed to star. Hard to believe that 3rd Rock beat Seinfeld for best comedy in '97 at the golden globes	agent_1:I've actually never even seen an episode of 3rd rock.

And with all that technology, Google built their first computer with the housing being made out of legos. agent_1:Computers can be made of anything. Russians made a computer that ran on water and someone built a working 16bit computer using nothing but basic minecraft building blocks! agent_2:Yep... and Disney definitely takes advantage of the computer making CGI movies agent_1:Indeed. Hollywood too have been remaking beloved classics with new CGI technology and overall better technology thanks to computers agent_2:and we definitely benefit from it all as consumers! agent_1:I am looking forward to the disney lion king's remake of the 1994 classic agent_2:yeah me too... but i am classic kind of person though!  should be interesting seeing it done in cgi though! agent_1:What do you think of live action remakes? agent_2:They are ok... like i said... much prefer the old school classics! agent_1:I wonder if that is because that is what we grew up with and are nostalgic or if they are simply better in quality? agent_2:yeah I am sure... I think the computer kind of takes away from the true art form agent_1:Who knows? Maybe one day we will reach a point were there won't be any distinction between films that rely on CGI painted performance and animated filmed that rely on photorealistic effects agent_2:That is scary.... human action will never truly be replaced! agent_1:Well transhumanists want to upload their minds into computers agent_2:That's just weird... but the way computers are going, it will definitely happen. agent_1:I agree that the future is limitless.

Do you have a pet? agent_2:I have a dog and two cats and you? agent_1:I have a cat. Domesticated animals have a white patch on the forehead it seems agent_2:I do not think my pets have that though to be honest agent_1:Mine either. Do you know who we have hiccups? agent_2:Yes they are left behind from when animals had gills and lungs agent_1:Yeah. Did you know the loch ness monster is a protected species?	agent_2:So cool.

But my parents do have an Amazon Alexa and my brother has a Google home which are similar devices. do you have one by the way? agent_1:Apple always overprices their stuff allowing others to offer products that are just as good at a lower price.  Kids and young adults buy them because they are ""cute"" and popular in their little clicks. agent_2:Yep I think so. It's crazy that there have been over four hundred million smart home devices shipped back in 2017 and it is projected to reach almost 1 billion devices by the year 2022 though, so they are definitely going to get more popular over time agent_1:I still feel stupid talking to an inanimate object. Siri wasn't even and Apple development.  It was originally intended for Android but Apple bought it. "	agent_2:Haha that's really weird. I also think it's weird that Apple went for the high-end Market with their homepod, when you can get a Google home for about $100 a homepod goes for almost four hundred, that's definitely a rip off	agent_1 likes technology. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['technology', 'smart home', 'technology'].

I know people like to know what they are wearing and stuff, but it seems trivial to me. agent_2:Very true, but no matter what they must conduct themselves with dignity, and their past all of a sudden becomes more in the public eye.  I never care who/what/where people wear.  Id rather see their actions. agent_1:The first lady is damned if they do and damned if they don't, get involved in policy that is. agent_2:It is sadly true.  Supposedly Melania wore a Jacket saying ""I dont care.  Do U"" to the boarder separated children agent_1:Probably not the best choice, but I'd hate it if every choice I made was monitored by hundreds of people every day. agent_2:Very true, It is hard to make any statement without a certain base of people hating on it. agent_1:The thing now that everyone has iphones and can take pictures of you every second of the day. agent_2:That does make things so much harder.  In the past, you might have to worry about some secret cameras, but mainly only got photographed  at big events.  Now it can be at the store. agent_1:The only place they can escape the constant media is in the White House, or any other private residence they may have. agent_2:Very true.  If they did sneak photos they might catch her using floppy disks.  The white house still uses thos for storage"	agent_1:That would be scandal, they'd accuse her of being a technophobe.

Did You hear about that ? agent_2:No I didn't ...I'd bet it was more soothing that  the news agent_1:what do You mean, You don't like regular news ? ;) agent_2:Absolutely not. News is often depressing, and I could stand without it. Now, toss on a piano song, or music....now you've got me. Though I hate classical music. Well, most of it. agent_1:I wander if Brits were surprised when instead of news they got piano music instead ;) lol agent_2:They may have thought they won the lottery. I'm an older dude, but give me a nice pounding Elton John or Billy Joel rocker on piano, and I'm rockin' away! agent_1:Hey I'm with You, I mean I'm only 37 but yeah... I'll take ""Piano man"" instead of news any day ;) agent_2:It makes me happy when a younger guy like yourself, I'm 61, still could listen to a good piano song. Didn't realize people your age still know what musical instruments are? Well, not that you're that young. agent_1:hey ! :) I'm young inside ;) but yeah... I listen to all kind of rock, blues and metal... Pink Floyd, Joe Bonamassa, Dire Straits, Metallica, Nirvana... and many more ;) agent_2:Nice! I used to be a DJ in clubs back in the day....remembered playing a ton of that stuff. Been to a lot of concerts? agent_1:Oh yes, I think I've beat my record last year... I saw Nick Cave twice, I won tickets to see Metallica, and I saw King Crimson for the first time. Oh, and I saw Joe Bonamassa too ;) agent_2:You got to see some good ones, that's for sure. I stopped going to concerts years ago!, but man....back in the 70's, seeing Pink Floyd, Bachman Turner Overdrive, Heart and Electric Light Orchestra on the same bill was fantastic....and it was only $15.00 a ticket. agent_1:Holy Crap ! ;) Now to see phil collins it's like $350 and those are not even good seats... ;) times changed, that's for sure... agent_2:Yep. I wish the Factual Section 3 was Rock Music instead of Classical. The only story I have on classical music, is that I was a limo driver for an Arab shiek back in 2001. He bought me a 10 disco best of Classical artists box sex. Wasn't bad, but only listened to it once or twice. That's all I got on Classical music. agent_1:I'm not too close to classical music, but I did like the soundtrack to Space Odyssey 2001 - it's as close to classical I got ;) agent_2:LOL....I hear ya. Oh, and sorry for the spelling, it was ""10 Disc"" and ""box set"" I meant. I'm gonna get killed for that....lol agent_1:lol, yeah I figured that one out ;) although You never know with those Srab Sheik - they like to have a good time :) agent_2:LOL. So, let's see, I covered piano, concert, and classical. Anything else you'd like to bring up? Been nice chattin' with ya! agent_1:Something I'm sure You're aware of - In 1972, pink floyd recorded a live concert at the ancient roman amphitheater in pompeii...with no audience.

9543	"agent_1:Hello! Are you interested in poetry at all? agent_2:Hi! Poetry is ok, not really my thing. I read poems in school. Nowadays, I don't. I prefer novels. You? agent_1:I didn't love poetry either! But I do like individual poems. There's a poem that read normally is sad but becomes inspiring when read backwards. agent_2:That's great! Words can be depressing or uplifting depending on their order. Edgar Allan Poe only received $9 for the publication of ""The Raven."" I wonder if he got royalties. agent_1:That's surprising! I'm sure he got compensated somehow. I think words can be beautiful when orchestrated properly. Once I read a 224 word long poem, that turns out to be an entire palindrome! agent_2:HOw long did it take to write that poem? It sounds like something that would require a computer. I wonder if it's a pretty poem. agent_1:I'm sure it must have taken forever. On the other hand, the Japanese alphabet is naturally a poem when recited in order. agent_2:I think you mean the Javanese alphabet. The Japanese alphabet wouldn't work. Do you get a chance to go to concerts much? agent_1:Oh I think you're right! And I do sometimes! I saw Linkin Park in 2001, I thought it was very unique until finding out they had almost 324 concerts just that year. agent_2:They were on a tear, weren't they. I think they must have made a ton a cash that year. The following album must have had high expectations. I couldn't tour like that. agent_1:Oh I'm sure it must have been exhausting. Then again imagine the Ramones, they played 2,263 concerts total over 20 years, that's insane! agent_2:The Ramones must have discovered the secret of youth. How could they maintain that pace? Their fans must love them. agent_1:I'm sure they appreciated them like crazy for doing that. On the other hand I remember there was a Creed concert that was so awful that people actually filed a lawsuit against them. agent_2:Creed must have done something so bad for their own fans to sue them. Did they won? Does it matter? I hope they learned a lesson. agent_1:I have no idea, I'd guess they didn't win. Maybe it was the fault of the theater and not Creed? Like there's an ancient Roman amphitheater in Croatia, I bet the acoustics there are awful. agent_2:I bet it wouldn't matter for Creed. They would get sued no matter where they played. I wonder if the Ramones ever played in Croatia. agent_1:Well I know Pink Ployd recorded a live concert at a different Roman amphitheater in Pompeii! Then again there was no audience so who knows how good it really was. agent_2:It was probably ok, but was it necessary? Why that amphitheater? Then again, they were artists. Who knows what they want. agent_1:Yeah people have interesting choices for sure. Have you ever been to a violin concert? agent_2:I have been to the symphony, but not concerts for violins specifically. agent_1:Neither have I! But I think it would be an experience for sure. There's a musical piece where artists gradually leave the stage until only two violinists are remaining. agent_2:That's interesting. I wonder what it sounds like. Very modern, I suppose. I wonder what a violin made out of stone sounds like. It probably ""rocks"" pretty hard."	agent_1:Haha definitely it would be nice to see that at a concert.

They are school not a hospital.  agent_2:Yes I agree,  unless they have medical training.  agent_1:It was all kinds of things with her... Infections, injections, etc... The school would need a team.

Did you know that the deepest note in the universe is emitted by a black hole!  agent_1:It wouldn't surprise me. I think a lot of his work was around the Event Horizon's if I remember correctly.  agent_2:If you fold a paper in half 103 times it would be as thick as the observable universe! agent_1:Somehow I don't believe that.  agent_2:Ok.  Thats cool.  I have no idea if thats true,  something I read recently in some cool facts.  This is no where near my area of expertise.  I did read that there may be a universe inside the black hole though,  isn't that crazy! agent_1:Yeah, they have a lot of wacky ideas about the universe. That much I do know. They also propose it is a hologram.  agent_2:I also read that the universe used to be opaque due to there being too much plasma that light could not travel through it.  agent_1:Yeah, I've read that as well. There are stars in the universe that are cold enough to be touched by humans.  agent_2:Thats really cool.  I can't imagine touching a star.  Have you ever heard of a hubble telescope?  Apparently it discovered a galaxy so big it shouldn't exist,  according to physics.  agent_1:Yeah, that is pretty cool. I know a lot about Hubble, it is a pretty cool telescope.  agent_2:Sounds like it!   agent_1:Yeah, I remember when they did the space walk to fix it, remember that?  agent_2:I do not.

Did you know that hummingbirds are known to take spiderwebs to use on their nests?  Little thieves...  agent_1:They do? I guess spiders must be angry at them then lol, you know that most birds have bones that are so hollow that their skeleton weights even less than their feather!! agent_2:Yeah, I bet there are a lot of bird-hating spiders.  I did know that but the wild birds of Australia have an added talent: they can mimic the sounds of stuff like car alarms and chainsaws.  agent_1:That must be interesting, I would love to hear a bird that sounds like a chainsaw lol, that bird has some identity issues for sure. agent_2:Yep, some bird therapy is in order.

Sadly, I'm told the REAL Christopher Robin (who the books were based on) hated them and never took any money from them.  I find that sad, since his father wrote the books for him.."	agent_1:That is a shame. I wonder why the real chris hated them. Perhaps he wanted a father to be there for him rather than children books	agent_2 dislikes books. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['books', 'TV shows', 'reboot'].
5829	"agent_1:How's it going, have you seen the 2018 release of Black Panther? agent_2:No I haven't but I understand there is some parallel being drawn between it and ""The Wiz"" agent_1:I'm not to familiar with the Wiz, is that based on the Wizard of Oz? agent_2:Yes, it has much different music (e.g., funk and disco).  The movie had Michael Jackson.  It doesn't have the song ""Be a Lion."" agent_1:I've heard the Wiz as being described as weird, from the description I tend to agree agent_2:It is kind of weird... The music and the dancing are at the core.  You might remember the song ""Ease on Down the Road."" agent_1:Maybe but not that I think of it the normal Wizard of Oz is weird, like really weird so I guess the Wiz should be weird too agent_2:There is a big cultural difference between the two, like a farm in KS vs. Detroit.  Funny, it is at the Ford Theater in D.C.   agent_1:Ford Theater, isn't that were Lincoln was assassinated?"	agent_2:Yep.  I didn't realize it was still a theater.

Fan fiction sucks. it is copyright violation. Someone should sue Julius Caesar!	agent_2:haha yes! Maybe hercules can prove he is real by suing!

6090	agent_1:Hello, are you a baseball fan? agent_2:I do not know much about baseball but I have been to a bunch of games, including a few Yankee games. It does have the second highest attendance. agent_1:Baseball games are fun to go to but they take a long time. I usually end up walking around the concourse for a couple innings. agent_2:I never knew why baseball managers wore uniforms. I thought it was just to blend in with the team and support the team. Ends up they are able to play if the need arises. agent_1:Looking at some of the managers today I think it's more of a tradition now. I know in the past there were a few times where there were actual player/coaches. I believe Ted Williams was one. agent_2:I found it very surprising that a married couple had been scheduling all 2430 major league baseball games up until 2005. I figured it was just a computer. agent_1:Baseball is deep into it's tradition. They probably didn't worry about any form of software until it became too complicated.	agent_2:You're right. That's probably why baseball cards are so popular too, tradition.

That surprises me, I thought it would be about equal. Iphone's have 75 elements in them. agent_1:75??? Huh... I feel like iphones are older than 12 years. They came out in 2007?	agent_2:I did too.

One was Tommy Orange's debut novel. agent_2:I heard about that one, its the one with the little native american boy right? agent_1:Yes! It was quite an emotional read. It made me really think about how life is like for them. agent_2:Native Americans suffered for a lot of years, its a story that involves a lot of blood and tears and not an easy story to tell	agent_1:Definitely!

Do you ever listen to things on LP?   agent_1:Yes...... when i was in clg agent_2:I still have one at home and some of my grandfathers old records, but for most of my music I ve moved in to the 20th Centruy and gone with CDs and mostly MP3. agent_1:thats amazing......  agent_2:Do you have a favorite album? agent_1:castle of glass, my favorite  agent_2:Im a big fan of Dream Theater's recent work The Astonishing.  It doesnt quite hold up to NWA's work or Dark side of the moon in terms of popularity, but I like it. agent_1:thats great..... i listen to their songs abut to be quiet frank i dont know them as you do........ agent_2:They are a little more obscure, kind of like Ricky Gervais, who was actually a pop singer in the 80's.  I had no clue about that. agent_1:best music was from the 80's.... all kinds...... wish we were born then. agent_2:Very true, a study from 2012 even proves music has become more similar in terms of musical construction since the 60's. agent_1:thats good news....... but nothing to beat a classic agent_2:Like We are the Champions being voted the catchiest pop song ever.  I cant think of a person who hasnt heard that one. agent_1:Queen i a legend like he used to mention...... lots of his songs are my energy boosters agent_2:Freddie is probably one of the most iconic singers of all time.  All of their music is just fantastic.  The new stuff, even the k-pop band  Moranbong Band, which is top in Korea doesnt hold a candle to what was done in the 80-90's agent_1:absolutely....... songs  like another one bites the dust, Crazy little thing called love, i want to break free, we will rock you and of course bohemian rhapsody .... legendry agent_2:I find it hard to believe Linkin Parks ""hybrid theory"" is the best selling album of the 21st century."	agent_1:its really good , paper cut, with you,  runaway...... good songs	agent_2 likes music. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'music', 'no'].

Do you know why managers wear uniforms during the game? agent_1:I think they can rush on the field at a moment's notice to play a position. Highly unlikely though. agent_2:Yeah, interesting and good for them just in case. Do you know what kickball is called in Canada? agent_1:I dunno. Canadian kickball? agent_2:It is actually called soccer-baseball agent_1:That makes sense. Canadians would find the middle-of-the-road term for the sport. What about the man who found three million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic? That's pretty cool. agent_2:That is for sure, he made a lot of money there. DO you know who used to do the schedule for the major baseball league games? agent_1:I figured the schedule would be done by computer. Who does it? agent_2:It was a couple who did it for 24 years straight agent_1:Wow. That must have been a pretty sweet job. I wonder how much it paid.  agent_2:Yeah that is a sweet gig for sure. They scheduled 2430 games a year agent_1:That is a lot of games, but maybe year to year it doesn't vary so much. Get it right once and the following years are straightforward.	agent_2:True.

You know they published the government's plans to destroy them.  agent_2:That's right. I forgot that he found Wikileaks also. I didn't know that, but I recently learned that the government owns 86% of NV land. agent_1:That's a lot of land to be own by the government, what's their game plan, lol agent_2:Maybe Snowden knows! Apparently governments are to abide by governing principles that are to balance individual freedom and tyranny. agent_1:Yeah sounds suspect. In 2006, the us passed legislation that would protect government employees from being prosecuted for violating the Geneva conventions agent_2:Also sounds suspect. Did you know that Albert Einstein was asked to be Israel's president? But he declined. agent_1:That's deep. Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to invite Albert Einstein to the White House.  agent_2:Yeah, and the letter was intercepted and then the invitation was declined by Flexner. agent_1:Sounds like another administration i can think of.  agent_2:Einstein was very involved in American politics.

Did you also know that kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada? agent_2:No, that's an odd name. Did you know in baseball if a player catches a ball in their hat  the opposing team gets three bases instead of being out? agent_1:That's cool. Did you know that after the Chicago Cubs won the 2016 World Series, over 5 million people celebrated in the streets, making it one of the largest gatherings in human history? agent_2:No but I'm not surprised, it had been 108 years since the Cubs last won a world series agent_1:Yes, and the Chicago Cubs were the first baseball team to win back-to-back world series, and didn't win again until 2016. agent_2:I never knew the Cubs used to be named the Orphans, I wonder why they were called that agent_1:Not sure but I know that the Chicago Cubs and the Atlanta Braves are the two oldest teams in the major league baseball, both having been founded the same year as the Battle of the Little Bighorn.	agent_2:Interesting, I never knew the Cubs had pitchers with 4 and 6 fingers on their pitching hand, I wonder if those features gave them an advantage	agent_1 likes sports. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'baseball', 'Chicago Cubs'].
13468	agent_1:Hello! Are you interested in astronomy? I just learned some interesting facts about Mars. agent_2:I am interested, I think the universe is full with wonders! what did you learn about Mars please tell me. agent_1:I heard that in 2023, a Mars colonization project will launch! It'll be funded by a reality show based off the project. I would love to see something like that! agent_2:It would be nice to see indeed, although Im not sure if they are going to make, its going to be interesting since episode 1 agent_1:Agreed. That is a pretty major undertaking, I would be surprised if it worked out. Do you know any cool facts about Mars or Earth? I know a little bit. It's terrible, over 80% of the natural forests on Earth have been destroyed, I think mostly by humans. agent_2:That is a lot of trees!! we are seriously abusing the planet, it's curious how a day lasted 5.5 hours at the begining of earths creation agent_1:That's so interesting! I guess the Earth was a lot smaller then. Sometimes I think about whether there's life beyond Earth. The UN actually appointed an official ambassador to Extraterrestrials in the event that ETs ever made contact with humans. agent_2:Thats interesting, I think there is life outside earth, the universe is just too big.  agent_1:Agreed. Even if there's no other life in our Solar System, I have to believe that somewhere in the entire vast universe that life exists. Humans definitely have a fascination with the idea of ET life. It's interesting how sometimes people are scared of aliens (like in the movie Alien) and sometimes people see aliens as friends (like the movie ET) agent_2:And I bet aliens are totally different from what we have imagined, I would like to go to Jupiter it has a moon that could be considered a planet agent_1:Wow, that must be really large! I think I heard it would be a planet if it orbited the sun, but since it just orbits Jupiter it doesn't qualify as one. Moons are so powerful, Earth's moon is what causes the tides and stabilizes Earth's axis you know. agent_2:I know! our moon influences life on earth in many ways, we sure are lucky to have one.  agent_1:Yes. I wonder what life would be like without the moon. You know there was a red moon the other week? I saw it through a telescope and it was so beautiful. I think that's caused by a lunar eclipse but I'm not sure exactly. agent_2:I didn't see it, too bad that I missed it, I didn't know that was possible and it would be nice to watch the universe from Mars. agent_1:That's a really interesting perspective, I never thought of that. Well maybe if that colonization project goes through, eventually we COULD end up watching the universe from Mars! agent_2:I hope I can live to see that, earth is going to be helium free by the end of this century! agent_1:That's crazy! Do we humans need helium to survive? Hopefully the scientists can figure out a way to prevent that from happening.  agent_2:I dont think we do but not having helium might have an effect on something we do need to exist, its amazing how 71% of earth is water. agent_1:That's a lot of water. And I'm pretty sure the sea level is rising because of global warming and the ice caps melting. We need to take better care of our planet, we're going to run it into the ground if we're not careful!	agent_2:I agree, if we don't take care of it it might end up like Venus although a cool thing about venus is that it does not tilt.	agent_1 likes astronomy. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['astronomy', 'UN ambassador', 'moon'].

Ha! Unless they change the locations up!  Are you also a fan of Bill Nye? He actually served as a science consultant on Flubber, believe it or not! agent_1:i guess he knows a bit about the science of hypothetical substances. he is an entertaining fellow for sure. agent_2:Indeed he is! I also think it's amazing that Big Hero 6 was rendered with a 55,000 core supercomputer. That is amazing! agent_1:that is astonishing. i wonder how many processors theyll need for big hero 7. i dint see the other big hero movies. agent_2:Probably a lot more than 55,000. Ha! Did you ever see Wall-E? If so, the name is actually a tip of the hat to Walter Elias Disney himself! agent_1:that is cute. i wondered why they pickt such a strange name for a robot but now i see. but he dint have a mustache. agent_2:You're right, I don't think he did! Ha! I'd like to see Wall-E with factual hair like Kanye West's. I bet that'd be funny. Speaking of Kanye, you know he believes aids is man made?  agent_1:yes Kanye is an oddball when it comes to science.  agent_2:That is true. But he does do cool stuff every now again like the time he gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair at one of his concerts. That was nice of him! agent_1:i think that he undersatnds entertainment good but he doesnt have the knowledge for science.  agent_2:True. I loved how he did an SNL skit where he mocked himself interrupting award shows ironically two years before he interrupted Taylor Swift at an award show. Ha! agent_1:he knew the depths of his depravity and told the whole world first. i think that is honest of him  agent_2:Agreed. Since we're on the subject of rap, are you a fan of Tupac. I'm so glad his music is in the library of Congress of cultural significance. He was a talented musician! agent_1:Tupac is not my cup of tea but the man could rap the street an urban lullaby. Anyway, great chat! agent_2:Indeed he could! I also think Eminem can as well. I'm glad he became a rapper instead of becoming a comic book artist as he wanted to do growing up. Oh what might have been! agent_1:he could still DO that! the man has got years in front of him and tales of the street to tell. Have a good one! agent_2:So true. And speaking of Eminem, it's hilarious the judge who was trying a suit against Eminem back in 2001 delivered her ruling in the form of a rap. Glad some judges still have a sense of humor. Ha!

It was about Billie Bean managing the A's. agent_2:Yes.  Do you know how many baseballs are used in a season? agent_1:I have no idea. I assume a ton. They lose a lot for home runs, foul balls, and then you just see them switch out balls occasionally. agent_2:160,000 i understand. agent_1:Wow. Have you ever caught a ball at a game? agent_2:No but we had someone who worked there that we know give us one haha. agent_1:I don't think I ever have.

How cool is that. agent_2:I had no idea, I find it so funny that the boy from the shining had no idea he was acting in a horror movie until many years later agent_1:they do that alot with very young actors! agent_2:I had no idea, but I'm sure that would make sense since they're young and don't really know what is happening agent_1:and that way they won't be scared so much. i think it would be good. agent_2:Have you ever heard that it is not legal to own pets in boulder, CO? You can be their guardian though, whatever that means! agent_1:oh wow that's odd. i wish i could have studied zoology more in college! agent_2:Me too! Also Theodore roosevelt had a ton of pets like a bear and a hyena agent_1:that's cool!!!  i just read Under the provisions of the 1912 scottish protection of animals act, the loch ness monster is a protected species. ......how cool is that!!! agent_2:That is awesome! Never would have heard of that. In Germany in 2002 they became the first country to give animals constitunonal legal rights, crazy! agent_1:that is crazy haha! So cat lover is known as an ailurophile and a dog lover is known as a cynophile! agent_2:I wonder why I never learned any of that in school! agent_1:in kind of wondering the same thing!  The first cloned pet was a cat and its name was copy cat lol so funny  agent_2:that is funny, I can't believe there are more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia! I've never met anyone that has a pet tiger agent_1:i haven't either. that would be a bit scary!  Did you know There are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth?  agent_2:I'm not even sure that i know how many quintillion is to be honest.. I think its so crazy that animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated. I wonder how that even works?? agent_1:it's alot haha and yeah i don't know how the whole dot thing would work either. that's so odd! agent_2:That is odd, im going to have to look that one up for sure.

Those are the best. agent_2:It is amazing how star wars was created long time ago , in 1977 and with a movie made last year , the star wars fever is so alive! agent_1:It has to be one of the most sucessful franchises ever.  40 years and still has a great following. agent_2:It is incredible that the first eight films were nominated for academy awards, they were able to  create wonderful productions! agent_1:The total value of the franchise was about $65 billion.  It will definitely always be a legend! agent_2:And 20 century fox though star wars was going to be a failure!! agent_1:I heard that, apparently so did Harrison Ford, I heard he didnt want to be credited in the film initially. agent_2:Is that right! Well, good for George Lucas because this poor vision from 20 century made him a billionaire agent_1:It definitely did.  Do you know how much James Earl Jones was paid to record Darth Vader's lines? agent_2:I believe it was $7,500, and he just spent 2 hours and a half doing so agent_1:Isnt that crazy?  Some of those lines are so iconic, and he got so little for them.  Shame. agent_2:I agree, it is basically nothing.. Did you know George Luca's wife influenced the star wars movies a lot? agent_1:Yeah, didnt she receive an editing award too? agent_2:She got an award for editing!! I think she made an important contribution.. good job agent_1:She definitely changed some parts significantly.  It would have been far different without her. agent_2:Yes, she did major changes.. and is interesting George did not get the award for directing! agent_1:Eminem has more oscars than George Lucas!

They got third place back in 1930 which was the first FIFA World Cup agent_1:Nice, maybe they manage to climb back. you never know. The countries that host it do not have any net economic gains agent_2:Nope I heard about that. That's why I wonder why they're making an entire city for the World Cup. I guess the women's soccer team is better than the men's soccer team in the United States. Is that correct? agent_1:Yup, they seem to do much better. soccer players make more money than other sports combined, well the major ones agent_2:That is really crazy. I know that football the United States makes a ton of money too. I always wondered why Americans call it soccer.

Are you a big user of Netflix? agent_1:I am a big user, I have an account and use it almost every day, mostly after 9pm, what about you?	agent_2:No I don't have an account currently.

2894	agent_1:Dogs or cats!? agent_2:Dogs!  100% agent_1:I KNEW I LIKED YOU! Google likes dogs too! agent_2:Hahaha.  yes,  definitely,  I know a few people who work there and they get to bring their dogs to work!!!!  I wish I could do that.  agent_1:what, me too. I wouldn't get anything done but it would be amazing lol! Did you know dogs have 12 different blood types? agent_2:I did.  I guess I should get my dog checked for her blood type next time I see the vet.  Do you have a dog? agent_1:I will have to, yes, his name is rocky, he is my favorite pet of all time, what is your dogs name? agent_2:her name is Yuki, it means snow in Japanese,  she is a white dog lol She is a rescue so we dont know the breed,  shes a mutt.  agent_1:aww that is cute, rescue dogs tend to be the best! I want to clone my dog when he passes he is that good. They have cloned cats before, but no thanks to a cat agent_2:lol that would be cool if you can clone your dog after they pass!  Ive had a few dogs and its heartbreaking.  I even took like 5 years break in between getting another one because I didnt know if I was ready.  Im not a cat person at all,  they are cute. 	agent_1:ha i agree with that.

12439	agent_1:What do you think of remakes of movies and cartoons? agent_2:I enjoy remakes if they are done well.  agent_1:I think Disney is planning to remake the Lion King.  Disney released the first trailer for next year for the Lion King remake. agent_2:That's correct. Disney is calling the new Lion King remake a live action film but it relies almost exclusively on CGI so a lot of people consider it annimation. agent_1:I do too. A related debate arose when Avatar was released, with the Visual Effects Society honoring James Cameron's 2009 epic for, among other trophies, animated character in a live-action feature motion picture agent_2:I agree that these kinds of films are skirting the line between traditional annimation and heavily CGI assisted live action films. With the improvements in the technology I'm not sure it makes sense anymore to feel the need to classify such films in the traditional modes. agent_1:Yeah I feel the same way of course Jon Favreau, the director of the Lion King remake has naturally walked down this valley before, with his update of The Jungle Book.  agent_2:Yes, the difference being that the Jungle Book still had a human character and therefore a true live action person was seen on screen. The Lion King contains no humans and so it is likely that everything is CGI. agent_1:Technology is all consuming. During the 70s, disney recycled a lot of their animation frames, resulting in identical scenes in some movies agent_2:That was a different time, generating those frames took so long that it made sense to recycle those that you could. Creation is a much quicker process now with the aid of computer programs. agent_1:Did you know that Frozen was the first animated Disney film directed by a woman. agent_2:Yes I had heard that. Disney does a good job trying to increase representation in their films and parks when possible. They also dubbed the Lion King into Zulu for its African release. agent_1:Makes sense i wasnt at all surprised when Disney acquired Marvel.  agent_2:I was. Disney has made some major moves lately but acquiring the much more adult properies of Marvel Studios was a bold move to me. agent_1:Yeah Bold but incredible lucrative. They certainly have their eye on the future.   agent_2:True. They will make a lot of money off the films but even more in merchandise. They are also adding a Marvel Land to Disneys California Adventure that will be a big money maker for them. agent_1:Yeah i considerate a smart but gutsy play as you said. On another note did you know that Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total agent_2:That's hard to imagine so many unknown species. I wonder where the estimate comes from. agent_1:Speaking of animals In 2002, germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights. agent_2:I think that is much needed. All countries should honor and respect animal rights. Scotland has declared the Loch Ness monster a protected species. agent_1:I agree i just hate it when animal lives some how trump human ones. nice talking to you agent_2:I'm not sure I've seen many situations where that occurs. It was nice talking to you as well. agent_1:Last bit of info about animals is there are about 20 Quintilian individual animals on planet earth.	agent_2:Interesting.

I like lizards but not snakes agent_2:What is your favorite type of lizard? agent_1:Iguana by far. I almost bought a baby one yesterday. I was looking at Chameleons too agent_2:Would you ever consider owning a larger one like a crocodile? agent_1:Heck no. They are illegal too, aren't they? agent_2:Oh I didn't realize they were illegal to own. agent_1:They are more closely related to birds and I only like parrots for birds, and the bald eagle of course agent_2:Do you like Taylor Swift?	agent_1:I do, kinda.

11030	agent_1:Hello.  Did you vote in the mid term election? agent_2:Hi yes I did. How about you? agent_1:I did. I think it is very important for all of us to vote. agent_2:It is important. I also like trivia about politics. Did you know that the senate used the same gavel for 165 years until Richard Nixon cracked it? agent_1:I heard about it.  Why did Nixon crack the gavel? He was not supposed to use it. agent_2:I doubt that he did it on purpose. He probably just got carried away. But I'll bet he felt pretty bad. agent_1:I said earlier that voting is important.  In India, they went even further.  They set up a polling booth in a forest full of lions just to give one person the opportunity to vote. agent_2:I don't think we would go that far do you? agent_1:No, I do not think so.  Did you hear about the senate and their candy drawer?  	agent_2:Yeah, it must be nice. But I guess you have to give some of them free candy just to show up. Look at the Senator they had to drag in by his feet in 1988.

2512	agent_1:hey there do you watch any shows on Netflix agent_2:Yes I have a subscription, been watching The Office.  They have come out with their own originals too called Netflix Original.  What about you? agent_1:oh ya I love stranger things and other shows they have, I do the digital though not with dvds agent_2:Oh no I don't do DVDs either just the streaming service.  It's too bad it doesn't have Game of Thrones though, that show has gotten 37 emmy awards. agent_1:I do like GOT! George RR Martin is the author and a genius! agent_2:It is such a hit parents are naming their kids Arya.  Only a couple more months until the last season starts. agent_1:ya I can't wait, weird that charlie Chaplins granddaughter is in the show too! agent_2:Wonder if they ever offered Tom Cruise a part, he has won so many awards for best actor, they probably can't afford him. agent_1:ya, he is a great actor though, so many classic roles like Maverick in Top gun and Ron Kovic in Born on the Fourth of July	agent_2:Yeah I really like him in The Last Samurai.

3144	agent_1:Hey how is it going, you ever cook a turkey during Thanksgiving? agent_2:No, the only bird I ever cook is chicken; I'm looking to expand my skillset, though! They're the most numerically successful class of tetrapods. agent_1:Ah I gotcha, I was going to say there are some tips to maximize space in the oven during Thanksgiving, but that might just bore both of us haha. That's pretty cool about chickens, there are over 10000 birds that classify as tetrapods. agent_2:I'm sure that some like hummingbirds don't lend themselves to eating, but I know that ostrich steaks are a thing; I wonder how to cook those! I guess they can be so big because they don't fly. agent_1:True, I'm surprised they still have wings. I cannot believe how small hummingbirds are, only 2 inches! agent_2:I guess they're still evolving to the point where the wings disappear. Some birds don't get that chance--the famously extinct dodo bird is actually a sub-family a pigeon that I guess didn't evolve as much as it needed to! agent_1:Interesting, it's funny that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. That is really cool to me. agent_2:That's very resourceful. Some wild birds in Australia are resourceful in mimicking the human world sounds of cameras, car alarms, and chainsaw, although I'm not sure exactly what purpose that would serve. agent_1:I've heard that, they're pretty resourceful. I didn't know how light birds were, their skeleton is hollow and weighs less than the feathers. agent_2:Maybe that's why some birds are able to migrate from Alaska to northern Mexico without sleeping; the light weight must keep them from getting too exhausted. agent_1:That is some cardio! They all have feathers, beaked jaws, lay eggs and have a four chambered heart, I wonder how far they are from dinosaurs. agent_2:Even if they are distantly related, I bet dinosaurs didn't dance the way some birds do to impress their potential mates. They're more closely related to humans in that way. agent_1:I bet not. At least they don't have to worry about having 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week to go through like professional ballet dancers. agent_2:That's a lot, but I guess that kind of dancing is stressful on shoes that are supporting the weight on such as small surface. Did you know that Tupac danced ballet in high school and was even the mouse king in a production of the Nutcracker?	agent_1:I never knew that, I did know Bruce Lee was a great dancer that won a dancing championship in 1958.	agent_2 likes movies. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movies', 'hobby', 'bird'].
3192	agent_1:Do you like birds?  I love watching them! agent_2:I do, too! So many of them are beautiful, and even the ones that aren't are still incredibly unique. They can be anywhere between 2 inches or 9 feet! agent_1:I think it's incredible how easily they can fly.  It's probably because their bones are so hollow that the entire skeleton weighs less than the feathers! agent_2:Probably! Did you know one of the smallest birds, a hummingbird, will actually steal spider webs construct and repair their nests? agent_1:That's funny!  There are wild birds in Australia that can mimic the sound of cameras, car alarms, and chainsaws. That could get noisey! agent_2:Wow. I wonder if they're in the parrot family or if other birds outside of the parrot family can mimic sounds like that? agent_1:That's a good possibility!  The extinct dodo bird is actually a sub family of pigeon.  Interesting. agent_2:That is interesting! Can you believe there are some birds that will migrate all the way from Alaska to Mexico without sleeping? agent_1:That's pretty incredible!  Do you like to dance? agent_2:Only if I've had a couple of drinks, but I respect the art form absolutely. How about you? agent_1:I can't dance but wish I could.  Tupac danced ballet in high school and ended up portraying the mouse king in the Nutcracker! agent_2:That's pretty impressive! Bruce Lee was also evidently a pretty good dancer. He won the Hong Kong Cha-Cha Championship in 1958! agent_1:Wow.  I had no idea he danced but I can see that going hand in hand with the karate moves. agent_2:Most definitely. Did you know babies spontaneously dance when they hear music? I guess we as humans appreciate rhythm regardless of age! agent_1:I didn't know that.  Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week.  That could get expensive! agent_2:Definitely! Though I can imagine why, standing on your tip-toes so frequently with all of your body weight must be extremely taxing on shoes! agent_1:Ouch!  That's all I'll say.  I would have broken toes.  Michael Jackson has a patent on a device that was used to help him achieve the extreme lean in some of his dance moves. agent_2:Hey, have you ever played Tetris? agent_1:I did back in the day.  The 3 best selling videogames of all time are Tetris, Minecraft, and Wii sports.  I had fun chatting with you! agent_2:You, too!

I didn't know Tom Hanks had a brother that does his voice on video games and merchandise... agent_1:Jimmy Hanks!  I think I have heard about that before, good call! agent_2:I guess ya gotta help out your bro.  Video games were once called ""cathode ray tube amusement devices"" by the military...

Did you know that Venus doesn't tilt so it has no seasons? agent_1:That is interesting, I think it is the only planet that rotates clock-wise as well.  agent_2:For really weird rotation, Uranus actually rotates sideways and seems to ""roll"" around the sun.  agent_1:Thats crazy, I wonder what earth would be like if we weren't spinning around, and we were rolling like uranus lol.  agent_2:I guess we'd have really burned and cold poles.  Jupiter has a moon. Ganymede, that's more than big enough to be a planet if it were rotating the Sun. agent_1:Very interesting.  I guess there is a planet out there that has crazy winds of glass that blow at 4500 mph! agent_2:Wow, that would require a bit more than an umbrella...

You? agent_1:I didn't love poetry either! But I do like individual poems. There's a poem that read normally is sad but becomes inspiring when read backwards. agent_2:That's great! Words can be depressing or uplifting depending on their order. Edgar Allan Poe only received $9 for the publication of ""The Raven."" I wonder if he got royalties. agent_1:That's surprising! I'm sure he got compensated somehow. I think words can be beautiful when orchestrated properly. Once I read a 224 word long poem, that turns out to be an entire palindrome! agent_2:HOw long did it take to write that poem? It sounds like something that would require a computer. I wonder if it's a pretty poem. agent_1:I'm sure it must have taken forever. On the other hand, the Japanese alphabet is naturally a poem when recited in order. agent_2:I think you mean the Javanese alphabet. The Japanese alphabet wouldn't work. Do you get a chance to go to concerts much? agent_1:Oh I think you're right! And I do sometimes! I saw Linkin Park in 2001, I thought it was very unique until finding out they had almost 324 concerts just that year. agent_2:They were on a tear, weren't they. I think they must have made a ton a cash that year. The following album must have had high expectations. I couldn't tour like that. agent_1:Oh I'm sure it must have been exhausting. Then again imagine the Ramones, they played 2,263 concerts total over 20 years, that's insane! agent_2:The Ramones must have discovered the secret of youth. How could they maintain that pace? Their fans must love them. agent_1:I'm sure they appreciated them like crazy for doing that. On the other hand I remember there was a Creed concert that was so awful that people actually filed a lawsuit against them. agent_2:Creed must have done something so bad for their own fans to sue them. Did they won? Does it matter? I hope they learned a lesson. agent_1:I have no idea, I'd guess they didn't win. Maybe it was the fault of the theater and not Creed? Like there's an ancient Roman amphitheater in Croatia, I bet the acoustics there are awful. agent_2:I bet it wouldn't matter for Creed. They would get sued no matter where they played.

This year we recently had a bunch of hummingbirds..that was a first for me and so exciting. SO TINY.. agent_1:I also find it interesting that some birds can fly from alaska to north america without sleeping when they migrate. agent_2:Birds are very interesting because of a lot of facts.  I think it helps with their flight that their bones are hollow so not weighed down.  agent_1:Yes, they are interesting. I did not know that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. I find that very interersting. agent_2:I have watched them pull some to make them nearby.  The way they flit about is so beautiful to watch.  It is almost elegant like a dance. ..performing art! agent_1:Yes, did you know that Jackie Chan manages a k-pop band. I did not know that but i think it's cool. agent_2:It seems that so many you wouldn't think to have other interests do.  Jackie in music, Bruce Lee in dancing.  A championship even! agent_1:It seems to be in a kpop band you have to be tough because they go through bootcamps before being signed. agent_2:Boot camps for bands.. Guess it takes a lot of stamina for the dancing and singing.  Kind of the same I would assume for figure skating.  Can you imagine the work to land a triple axel? agent_1:That is true. It looks hard. Did you know babies spontaneously dance when they hear music. They are cute. agent_2:Music is a wonderful thing, so much to come out of it.  Symbiotic relationship with dance and music. Tupac was able to do both- never would have thought ballet for him though. agent_1:Yes, that definitely does not fit his image. I was surprised that ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week. That is a lot. agent_2:The tip starts to break down and doesn't hold form.  Same with skates, have to keep them sharp or can't get the edge for spins and jumps. Would have to assume that Nagasu goes through a lot of skates for this reason. agent_1:I like that she wanted to do the triple axel so bad that she dreamed she could . That shows heart for wanting to do something. agent_2:Especially when she had been passed over for the previous Olympics.  Rippon omitted his quad jump at the start, not as much heart I guess. agent_1:And she is part of the record books for being the first U.S. lady to land triple axel in olympic competition. agent_2:She had her wish of making America proud.  Guess the same can't be said for the Russians because of the prior doping scandal. agent_1:Yes, the doping scandal can be hard to come back from. It is amazing the amount of doping in sports today. agent_2:You would think that rather than compromising, like the Olympic committee did, they would just start to ban them.  Isn't teaching them anything to allow certain numbers to still participate and medal. agent_1:That's true. Did you know Michael Jackson had a patent on his leaning dance move. agent_2:I didn't know that there was a device involved in it.  Wonder with his death if the patent transferred to someone? agent_1:Maybe it got passed down to his children. agent_2:He certainly was talented.  Wonder if he did his own choreography? agent_1:I think he did. He worked too hard and I think that is what caused his death. He had his whole family to take care of really. agent_2:So much control.  At least after he left Jackson 5 he had some freedom unlike the kids in K pop. Agencies controlling everything. Yikes!	agent_1:That is true and to think K-pop had it's first group of women in the 60's is surprising.

Do you? agent_1:Don't have a favorite team either but my friends are huge Red Sox fans not sure if it's because they have gone on to win nine world series championships or what but with those stats, seems like a great accomplishment. agent_2:Well they have an amazing performance. Did you know Lebron James partly own the boston red sox? agent_1:Oh really? I didn't know that, that must be a great investment! Lots of fans have superstitions surrounding games, do you have any?  agent_2:Indeed. Do you like the mlb? agent_1:Not really, the only player I'm familiar with is Babe Ruth who was caught stealing to end the game and lose the world series in 1926. agent_2:Well it has its pros and cons. After a 17yr old female pitcher struck out babe ruth and lou gehrig, she was banned from pro baseball agent_1:I wonder how that banning action would fare in today's world and society, you think it would receive negative press? agent_2:I think it would. Most men sports leagues don't outright ban females. They usually just have very difficult requirement to meet for females like the nfl agent_1:Oh yeah, I heard about that. I wonder if thee were collectible cards and females did make it to play on the male dominant teams, would the cards be as valuable as other cards or extra valuable, like a man found three million dollars worth of cards in his grandfathers attic! agent_2:I guess attics are treasure troves	agent_1:For some, unless its the attic of a hoarder.

Looks like it is not meeting it's potential as an educational tool agent_2:Hello there, I know just a little bit, I heard that is true though, that they don't really have the ability to customize the material to the individual or coach.  agent_1:That seems odd and something that would be easy to fix if the effort was put in. Learning history and geography seems like a perfect fit for VR agent_2:Yeah I think you are right, especially for those children that are strong visual learners.  agent_1:VR does sound like a great tool for those who struggle with time limits agent_2:Yeah I think it has the potential to be.  Do you know much about AI? agent_1:Not much except for what's in pop culture, I definitely couldn't explain Tesler's Theorem that well agent_2:I think I'm about the same, I know IBM's Watson is very helpful in the medical field.   agent_1:Yea I've heard of Watson and a little about Stanford's ai class which I might have to take a look at when I got the time agent_2:Did you know the actress Kristen Stewart co-authored a paper on AI? agent_1:No, I had no clue. I don't know if I'm more surprised of that or the first vr game being made in 1968 agent_2:Holy cow, I never would have guessed that about VR.  Did you know doctors are using it to treat phobias? agent_1:Yea, I've heard of that, very cool. Lockheed Martin uses VR to tour Mars which is pretty cool also agent_2:Wow, that would be pretty cool to try, I wonder what you have to do to be a part of that? agent_1:I don't know, maybe be in a smart class or just be in a school that is nearby a Lockheed Martin facility agent_2:Yeah you are probably right.  On a different note, are you a user of Facebook? agent_1:Yea, I think I started using it in 2006, two years after it was first founded by Zuckerberg and his Harvard classmates agent_2:Yeah I think I am the same, I'm pretty sure my roommate in college set one up for me in 2005.  agent_1:I use to like myspace a lot better in high school, Tom must be kicking himself for not buying facebook in 2005	agent_2:Yeah think about how much money was lost not buying it way back then.

9994	agent_1:Hey! Did you watch FIFA World cup the last summer? agent_2:Hey yeah I caught some of it. I love it because it is an international competition! agent_1:I'm wondering about 2022 in Qatar. They even didn't build city for the final. It's small country actually. agent_2:Yeah they better get going. They promised air conditioned arenas that would reduce temps by 30 degrees celsius! agent_1:But I guess the decision to make it not in the summer 2022, but in low season like February or November. However, there is conflict with major championships. Anyway it would be fun. Do you watch tennis? agent_2:Yeah I definitely enjoy watching tennis. Back in 1978 they could use anything for a racket-that would make it more interesting! agent_1:Do you know that the longest match in history was 11 hours or about 3 days to play? It's incredible!!! agent_2:Wow they must have been exhausted. Whereas the longest point was a 643 point rally lasting 29 minutes! agent_1:I guess if in 2019 they make video how a helicopter is used to dry the glass tennis courts, it is going to be viral everywhere! haha agent_2:Oh that is so cool I wanna look that up! Ping pong is like tennis but it isn't the sports name. The sport is actually called table tennis. agent_1:do you play table tennis? agent_2:Yes I do it's a fun sport. you? I think it's funny how some people consider grunting before a tennis shot to be cheating. agent_1:True. I used to play a lot in my school years, but just don't remember when I played the last time. I didn't kniw that Lacoste was invented for tennis players. I was always sure for polo players, but they just adopted it. agent_2:Yeah same. I never knew the tennis ball was covered with felt, I thought it was a different type of material.	agent_1:I've read something about it. Anyway despite all, soccer makes much more money that football, basketball, baseball, golf, tennis and hockey combined.

8924	agent_1:Hi there. Do you enjoy to travel? I love visiting distant geographical locations! agent_2:Yes, I was actually in Paris last week. Do you travel? I was surprised there a website for people with couches to crash on, wish I knew it last week I had a long layover. agent_1:Whoa that's awesome! Did you eat crepes? I want to go to Iceland but it sounds like the public transport isn't great-will probably rent a car. agent_2:No crepes, I did have snails which I like. I've had a layover in Iceland, it looks like the moon. Flying it a lot of volcanic lava flows turned to rock. Did you know about that gnome stealing thing, take a picture, then return? That a lot of work. agent_1:Haha yeah I heard about that. Does sound like a lot of work. Did you fly any domestic flights in Iceland? That seems like a good way to get around there. agent_2:No, Iceland Air is cheapest to Sweden, I work there a couple times a year. I'm on the east coast so it's a quick flight though.

11844	agent_1:Do you shop at LL Bean? agent_2:Yes, I do.  I wondered when they would stop their lifetime refund guarantee.  People nowadays are just plain crooked. agent_1:I was only just made aware of that offer.  There are always people willing to exploit a system like that. agent_2:But, to go as far as to buy things at a yard sale and try to return them, that's just taking it to a new level of exploitation.  A crook will always be a crook, for sure! agent_1:This kind of promise works well in a small group, but once it goes national you lose the personal connection, and some will exploit it. agent_2:How true.  On a side note, do you own any UGG boots? agent_1:Not my style.  I see them around all the time now, are they comfortable? agent_2:Yeah, they are very comfortable and quite warm.  Do you know they were invented by surfers? agent_1:Looking at Uggs I would not associate them with surfing.  I suppose they keep you feet warm? agent_2:Yes, the surfers would put them on after leaving that cold ocean water, to warm up! agent_1:My boot and shoe supply is limited.  I have some work shoes and some running shoes, and one pair of dress shoes.   agent_2:Well, that's really all one needs! agent_1:I've tried the trick with the tea bag and smelly shoes, it does remove the smelly odor, replaces it with Earl Grey. agent_2:How cool, I'll have to give that a try, I have a stinky pair of gym shoes! agent_1:So Nokia use to make boots, difficult to see how they got into phones from that. agent_2:Rubber boots to be exact, and I think they still make them, too! agent_1:Probably best to stick with the boots.  The whole Smart Phone thing has left Nokia behind.  Maybe they need to pull themselves up by their boot straps. agent_2:That phrase got its start by meaning to do something that is pretty much impossible.  At this point, I think Nokia has lost the phone game!	agent_1:Thinking about that phrase you can see what it's original meaning was.  Maybe it changed because no one has boot straps now?	agent_2 likes hobby. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobby', 'outdoor activity', 'finance'].
11398	"agent_1:Hello,  how are you doing?  Did you know There is a programming language in which the programs are written in musical composition, and functional programs have jazz-like harmonies. agent_2:That's interesting. I guess there is a reason some jazz trumpeters have goatees. It provides comfort when playing. agent_1:hmmm didn't know that. Clint eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast, pianist, and scored several films, including million dollar baby agent_2:Speaking of celebrities, Pixar has a secret room that is often visited by celebrities. I wonder what is in it. agent_1:thats awesome! Robin williams in aladdin was the first actor to start the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films. agent_2:And apparently we even need celebrities in our kids tv shows. Carol Burnett was the first celebrity to appear in Sesame Street. agent_1:Thats interesting.  Judge judy makes $123,000 per episode, making her the highest paid celebrity only after lebron james. agent_2:Some celebrities try to do noble things with their fame. Ethiopia has a tv chef that thinks he can combat the country's hunger agent_1:Thats amazing!  agent_2:Speaking of celebrities wanting to do things for greater causes, did you know that the Beatles song ""come together"" was written for a campaign? agent_1:I did,  but I dont know which one.  agent_2:It was for Timothy Leary's 1969 California governor campaign. agent_1:Good to know! Ralph lawrence carr was the only governor to oppose the internment of japanese americans during ww2 agent_2:That is kind of depressing! agent_1:I know right. Texas elected their first female governor, the second in the nation, before some states even ratified the 19th amendment. agent_2:Well, that is kind of encouraging. Did you know that in 1934 North Dakota seceded from the US because North Dakota's governor declared martial law? agent_1:Interesting.

I dont see it as the supreme achievement in comedy like he does though. agent_2:I was going to ask what you thought about it.  Jack Black was going to star in the Green Lantern which was originally supposed to be a comedy.   agent_1:I think it would have been better as a comedy. I like Jack Black movies. agent_2:I love them!  He cracks me up.  I like corny goofball comedy.  I used to like watching 3rd Rock from the Sun when it was on tv for that same reason. agent_1:Yeah I liked the goofy brother. Dont remember his name. I thought he was funny. agent_2:Yes.  I can picture his face, but can't remember his name either.  That show won a golden globe for best comedy series in 1997. agent_1:considering the other shows that were on at the time that is surprising. agent_2:Yes.  It beat out Seinfeld, Friends, and Frasier. agent_1:Well me personally. I would rather watch third rock any day. Those other shows were quite popular in their day though. agent_2:Yes.  I agree.  Do you know who the highest all time box office star is? agent_1:Yeah its Tom hanks. Over 8.5 billion in the Box office. Thats a lot of money. agent_2:Holy smokes!  You're not kidding!  Did you know Disney's animation studios almost shut down after ""Sleeping Beauty"" was a box office failure? agent_1:It may have flopped in the box office, but it became pretty popular after that. I would say they made a good bit of money off sleeping beauty. agent_2:I would think so too.  However it wasn't their biggest flop.  That would have been ""Treasure Planet"" which was one of the most expensive box office flops of all time! agent_1:I dont think I even saw that one. agent_2:I remember it, but don't remember seeing it either.  Silence of the Lambs had a box office of over $270 million and came out on Valentines Day 1991."	agent_1:That was a good movie. Still a classic.

Have you ever heard of their unwritten rules such as if you hit one of our we'll hit one of yours? agent_1:Well, Yes and yes. I do not like the unwritten rules. Seems too unfun... Do you like them? agent_2:Some of them seem more like common sense to me.  I mean, not bringing a pet to the batting cage for one makes sense. agent_1:That one does make sense. Mine are more like, pimp your HR trot. Go ahead. Ill be better next time... agent_2:I like the unwritten rule of don't eat baked beans before a double header and don't order out for sushi during a rain delay. agent_1:I understand the baked beans, that's common courtesy... But what's wrong with sushi? agent_2:I don't know, maybe they think the guy will get sick or something.  The players do do some running to bases and maybe they think that'll slow them down. agent_1:Makes sense. I do hate the rule about stealing when you are down or trying a bunt when you are getting no-hit. agent_2:What does the rule say about those? agent_1:Don't do those things. If you are down big, you shouldn't steal. If you have not gotten a hit, you shouldn't bunt. agent_2:I don't think I like those either.  It would seem to me you would want to steal and try to make some runs.  Hey did you know that a team will get three bases if the opposing team catches a ball in their hat? agent_1:I know a ton about baseball but had no idea that is a rule. Thanks for the knowledge! agent_2:I've watched my fair share of games and never knew that till recently myself!  I just thought of some more common sense rules though.

I do that more than I would like to admit. I wonder what the loch ness monster evolved from. agent_2:I did, I hate it when that happens, and I have no idea, good thing Nessie is a protected species. Since 1912 at least. agent_1:How long do loch ness monsters live for? How many are there? I have questions! I do not need answers though. I would like to know more about a sound frequency that causes fear in humans. I have enemies I need to vanquish! agent_2:Well Nessie is a myth, hopefully one day we can find out if the myth is true or not, and thats sounds interesting didnt know there was a fear frequency for humans. agent_1:Me either. Did you know we may have lost all of our body hair as recently as 240000 years ago? As a swimmer, I still see a lot of hairy humans! agent_2:I guess many of them didnt lose it lol, there are some hairy humans out there I agree with you agent_1:Did you know ribs grew back? That's crazy! How come other bones don't grow back? I broke my arm and that didn't grow back. agent_2:I didnt know that, how long does it take for them to grow back? and that sounds painful agent_1:I wonder if they regrow in other animals like horses? agent_2:Not sure about that, but that is an intersting question do you like horses? agent_1:I do like horses but I am a little afraid of them.

I wonder why it doesnt happen often, I havent seen it, that would be interesting to see though.  agent_2:nope I think they should do that more, do you like the Yankees? agent_1:I think they are a great team, the team has a lot of history for sure, do you like them? agent_2:I do actually, they win a lot and I like winning teams haha, I guess they were created in 1901	agent_1:Its a winning team for sure lol, you know that in 1973 pitchers just swapped families permanently, that seems really odd	agent_2 likes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'team', 'baseball'].

In fact, one of its moons (Ganymede) would actually be considered a planet if it orbited the sun. agent_1:That is pretty cool. And Venus does not tilt hence it only has one season agent_2:Thats kind of similar to Uranus as well. It rotates sideways and basically rolls around the sun unlike the rest of the planets that spin. agent_1:And how about that planet where it precipitates shards of glass? That sounds scary agent_2:Yikes! That is scary thankfully we don't have to worry about that here. Did you hear that astronomers detected a planetary system with building blocks of life roughly 455 lightyears away? agent_1:I am so curious about that, so intrigued. How about planet earth? Too bad we have already destroyed 80% of the forests in it agent_2:I know! That's sad, isn't it? If our entire history was seen in a 24 hour period, we as humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds and in that brief time, we've already destroyed most of the natural forests. That is so upsetting.  agent_1:It is very upsetting and we do not seem to be stopping at all. What a shame. When earth was formed the days were only 5.5 hours long. Can you imagine that? agent_2:Wow! I honestly couldn't. We would never have time to accomplish anything! Ha! Can you also believe earth will be basically free of helium when the 21st century ends? agent_1:Yeah that is crazy to me. What about those balloons? Do you believe in extraterrestrials? agent_2:Well, since the UN appointed an ambassador to extraterrestrials, I believe they do expect to make contact eventually. It would truly be neat to see! agent_1:I guess it is better to be prepared, just in case. Did you know sounds in Mars have a different pitch agent_2:That doesn't surprise me honestly.  Just as it would only take 2 or 3 days to get there if one traveled at constant 1G acceleration! Wonder if that's possible?	agent_1:Science is moving pretty fast, you never know.

I guess they started that in 2018, it sounds like a lot of people on Twitter were upset too agent_1:About Pride Month or something else? agent_2:I think they were mad that one of the rapper's was supporting president Trump, and they were very happy to hear that Disney was making the LGBT ears or something like that, I don't pay attention to Twitter so I'm not a hundred percent sure agent_1:Got it. Yeah, the rapper is Kanye West. Another singer, John Legend, asked West to ""reconsider"" agent_2:Speaking of Disney, what are you like about their movies? Did you know that for instance Minnie Mouse's real name is Minerva LOL agent_1:Nope. Glad they used the nickname, Minnie. What's your favorite Disney film? agent_2:I really like The Little Mermaid and I also like The Lion King, what about you? I don't really like Wall-e myself agent_1:Lion King was a fav of mine. Loved James Earl Jones, who voiced the father lion character. Little Mermaid had some great music like ""Under the Sea"". Disney is a huge studio today agent_2:Yes I agree with you! I also like the movie Big Hero 6, have you seen it? Apparently it was rendered using a 55000 core supercomputer agent_1:Haven't seen. Wonder what that computer looks like - Apple makes a lot of computers used by artists & filmmakers. agent_2:Yep you're right about that. Back to Kanye West though, what do you think about him giving a mic to one of his fans in a wheelchair at a concert? That was nice of him agent_1:Agree, but calling Trump a ""brother"" went too far. Trump is no bro! Kanye is big music celeb, though. agent_2:Yeah, he's definitely an interesting guy, his ideas are not always good though, for instance he thinks that aids is a man-made disease agent_1:Heard that. Since when did people create viruses like HIV? West has made a lot of big $$$ producing records, fwith influences from soul, to electro to gospel. agent_2:Yes that's a really crazy thing. Kind of like when he mocked himself on SNL for interrupting someone at an awards show, and then did it in real life to Taylor Swift, definitely the guy has some issues agent_1:Think so. His main genre, Rap, is huge, though. Has lots of components, like what is said, rhythm or flow, and tone. Are you a fan of Rap? agent_2:Yes I do like rap. I mostly like Tupac Shakur stuff, apparently some of his music is in the Library of Congress actually"	agent_1:'bout time.

I hear that is where it originated. agent_1:Yes, it did!! I have been there! You will love it! Lots of music and energy...It was developed from the blues and ragtime. agent_2:I guess Pakistan has a very good jazz orchestra. agent_1:Really, I didn't know they like Jazz, that's interesting! Did you know Jazz trumpeters like to wear a goatee? It gives comfort when playing. Makes sense. agent_2:I better not tell my son, or he will be trying to play my daughter's sax.

My goodness what's with the fire? I was interested to know about the computer program you mentioned? agent_2:He was recording a solo for Beat It. agent_1:Yes, hmmm seems like MJ's songs can cause fires! lol I think it would be pretty interesting to be on Pink Floyd's houseboat called Astroria!  It's a recording studio. agent_2:It's funny the sound that using coins as guitar picks lends to a song. Queens' guitarist does that. agent_1:Yes, he likes the English sixpence.

And you? agent_1:I also enjoy it when I can.  A while ago, ancient babylonians understood astronomy so well, they were able to track planets with mathematical precision!  agent_2:Its amazing that they were able to do that without the modern optics and computers we have today.  It seems the interest in astronomy is so great that even the Vatican has an observatory!  agent_1:I went to the Vatican a few years ago, and did not know that!  Wi-fi was actually a byproduct of research into improving astronomy imagery. agent_2:I doubt the younger generation would know how to live without WiFi.  They seem to live their life on the internet via social media.  Did you know that Finland has made access to the internet a human right? agent_1:I did not know it is a right in Finland! I agree with too much reliance now.  I don't know how many will need this, but there is 3g service and internet capabilities at the peak of mount everest.  So you can take the selfie up there before passing out.  	agent_2:LOL.  What amazes me is how people assume they can do anything, even on their employer's internet!

I didnt realize that they dominated in the northern states either. agent_2:ya I didn't either, also didn't know that red and blue weren't associated with republicans and democrats until the year 200 agent_1:Same here!  I thought those had been around forever! agent_2:I know! It seems like forever since we had a president who wasn't a Democrat or Republican, since 1853 actuallY! agent_1:That is a long time.  Just goes to show you how long the two party system has really been in power. agent_2:yup I agree, we should change how elections are run, did you know that Back in athens a long time ago, they would just do a lottery to elect officials	agent_1:I heard that was because they wanted to avoid oligarchy.	agent_2 dislikes politics. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'history', 'history'].

I guess dogs and elephants can do that. agent_2:Yeah they are smart. Did you know that they are not color blind, but they can't see as many different colors as humans? agent_1:I didn't know that, but that's cool.

It was about Billie Bean managing the A's. agent_2:Yes.  Do you know how many baseballs are used in a season? agent_1:I have no idea. I assume a ton. They lose a lot for home runs, foul balls, and then you just see them switch out balls occasionally. agent_2:160,000 i understand. agent_1:Wow. Have you ever caught a ball at a game? agent_2:No but we had someone who worked there that we know give us one haha. agent_1:I don't think I ever have.

Did You hear about that ? agent_2:No I didn't ...I'd bet it was more soothing that  the news agent_1:what do You mean, You don't like regular news ? ;) agent_2:Absolutely not. News is often depressing, and I could stand without it. Now, toss on a piano song, or music....now you've got me. Though I hate classical music. Well, most of it. agent_1:I wander if Brits were surprised when instead of news they got piano music instead ;) lol agent_2:They may have thought they won the lottery. I'm an older dude, but give me a nice pounding Elton John or Billy Joel rocker on piano, and I'm rockin' away! agent_1:Hey I'm with You, I mean I'm only 37 but yeah... I'll take ""Piano man"" instead of news any day ;) agent_2:It makes me happy when a younger guy like yourself, I'm 61, still could listen to a good piano song. Didn't realize people your age still know what musical instruments are? Well, not that you're that young. agent_1:hey ! :) I'm young inside ;) but yeah... I listen to all kind of rock, blues and metal... Pink Floyd, Joe Bonamassa, Dire Straits, Metallica, Nirvana... and many more ;) agent_2:Nice! I used to be a DJ in clubs back in the day....remembered playing a ton of that stuff. Been to a lot of concerts? agent_1:Oh yes, I think I've beat my record last year... I saw Nick Cave twice, I won tickets to see Metallica, and I saw King Crimson for the first time. Oh, and I saw Joe Bonamassa too ;) agent_2:You got to see some good ones, that's for sure. I stopped going to concerts years ago!, but man....back in the 70's, seeing Pink Floyd, Bachman Turner Overdrive, Heart and Electric Light Orchestra on the same bill was fantastic....and it was only $15.00 a ticket."	agent_1:Holy Crap ! ;) Now to see phil collins it's like $350 and those are not even good seats... ;) times changed, that's for sure...	agent_2 likes music. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'concerts', 'music genre'].

1975	agent_1:Hello!  Are you a tennis fan or do you play? agent_2:No, my dad used to, though. It seems like it's too intense for me agent_1:I only tried playing in college to kill time.  I stunk up the courts I was so bad.  The longest tennis match in history went on for over 11 hours and was spread over 2 days.  Crazy. agent_2:Was that at one of the big competitions, like an open or Wimbledon? agent_1:I'm not sure.  They once had to use a helicopter to dry the grass courts for the 1969 US open.  Bet that dried it fast. agent_2:That was the year after the first open when a black player won. But no black player has won since agent_1:Wow.  I didn't know that.  Polo shirts were originally invented by a tennis player and were later adopted by polo players.  Interesting. agent_2:So maybe we should really be calling them tennis shirts? Just like sneakers are often called tennis shoes agent_1:lol  Good point!  They say that 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes.  I question that... lol agent_2:Same. How do people know? How many pairs have survived since then? And what constitutes better performance? agent_1:I have no idea.  I bet those would be some smelly shoes though!  They say putting a dry tea bag inside smelly shoes will absorb the unpleasant odor.  I'll have to try that to try that on my smelly stinky shoes. Lol lol agent_2:Oh wow, I never knew that. I actually have a huge problem with that, so that will help. Surprised I didn't learn that when I googled solutions to that problem (which I've done like 100 times) agent_1:I'm a big googler myself.  A single google search requires more computing power than it took to send astronauts to the moon. Crazy how far technology has come since then.	agent_2:I can't even begin to understand how that makes sense.

Can you believe Jeff Bezos built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years? agent_1:No that's a really crazy thing to build. What do you think about the fact that the first customer to buy something on Amazon got a building named after him agent_2:I wish I was that person! When I was at Amazon I walked miles. Did you know that the workers walk between 7-15 miles each day. I believe it! agent_1:Wow that is crazy that's a lot of calories to burn in a day! I'm just glad that Amazon has an exclusive contract with USPS to deliver on Sundays, that makes me happy agent_2:Me too! I see them out delivering all the time! agent_1:Yeah I've seen them too, do you ever use the site IMDb by the way? agent_2:Yes. When I want to find out more about a person who is in the entertainment industry. agent_1:Yep I use that site almost everyday, it's crazy that Amazon owns them, they own almost everything LOL	agent_2:Yes they do.

Pretty sneaky.  agent_2:I suppose, do you play video games on consoles like the PlayStation? agent_1:I used to play video games a lot as a kid. Don't play now. No time. Little interest. Do you like to play? agent_2:No, but the US department of defense used over a thousand of those consoles to build a supercomputer because it was cheaper than the alternative! That sounds like massive processing power! agent_1:That's a smart way to go. Scale up simple units to get the power. I don't really know the PS. Aren't they up to PS4 or something? agent_2:Not sure since I don't play as well either, all I know is that it is created and owned by Sony who launched it in Japan. They were so popular and successful that they've sold at least over 100 million units! Wonder what X-box's numbers are. agent_1:Sony has made a great platform. Are the games good? Usually that drives the sales of the machine. Are the games on all the platforms now? agent_2:Not sure since those consoles can be used for research purposes, like researchers are using them to research black holes, maybe they are not only used for games. agent_1:I did hear that the military used the controllers for training troops on equipment. Very intuitive. They learned fast. I don't know why black holes for research though. Why not regular computers? agent_2:Probably since it was cheaper like the supercomputer they built out of the consoles. I wonder if I went on YouTube whether or not I could learn how to build a supercomputer as well. Do you use YouTube? agent_1:That's true. Cheaper.

Apparently baseball managers wear uniforms in case they have to play to replace players. agent_1:I wonder if that's ever happened before? Did you know that baseball use to be referred to as the Fall classics? agent_2:I will research about it later.  No, I did not know that (the fall classics). agent_1:Because in north america it is played during the fall season.  agent_2:I see.  Thank you for the information.  A married couple used to schedule all 2430 major league baseball games played each year for 24 years.   agent_1:That must of been pretty cool for them to do together. so the baseball season is how many games. do you know? agent_2:2430 games, I think.  I might be wrong. agent_1:That's a lot of games, no wonder pitcher arms get burned out.

X-files on the other hand... agent_2:The aliens missed their colonization date. Why so close to Christmas? I guess the winter solstice is a good date. agent_1:What a bunch of downers. At least we have will smith to protect us! agent_2:Did you know that over 80 percent of the Earth's forests have already been destroyed?

It think it is pretty crazy that parachutes of space vehicles are made from fabric you can buy at a fabric store. agent_2: Yeah it seems like that material is very high tech but easily accessible. Do you follow science news alot? agent_1:Not really. I do like reading articles like these though because I do like learning new things and I find science pretty interesting. I can't imagine all of the tests that scientists must have to run in order to figure out what materials to use for things. agent_2:I beleive the scientists doing this research will eventually find and even better material for a supersonic parachute. I think space exploration is the future of the US.  agent_1:Yeah I think you're right. What do you think about life on Mars? Do you think that Mars or any other planet will ever be able to sustain life on it? agent_2:I think there is microscopic life on mars possibly but more likely there is something on one of the outer moons of saturn, jupiter.  agent_1:Yeah. It would be pretty crazy to see that happen in our lifetime but it seems like it is pretty far off. agent_2:I think they should send a rover soon to one of the outer planets to get a closer look and potentially find life. If a rover can find something then we could potentally send a human to check. agent_1:One thing I found somewhat surprising was that 80% of our forests have been destroyed. I did not realize that it was that high. agent_2:I think the planet earth is very resiliant to us but it will only take so much damage to start a bad event for the human race. agent_1:Yeah. We definitely need to make sure that we are keeping good care of our natural resources. I think that most countries around the world though are taking climate change and protecting our earth pretty seriously which is good. agent_2:I dont agree that much that most countries are taking this seriously. There is china and india that are throwing garbage in the ocean. agent_1:Yeah I guess that is true. I guess I was thinking of most European nations but I didn't really think about a lot of Asian countries. It is astounding the amount of trash that is floating around the Pacific Ocean. agent_2:It could get so bad that eventually we may need to go to a new planet in the future.

If you went on Mount Everest would you take a selfie at the top?

I think it would be more accurate to say humans lost their fur (a consistent/extensive hair covering) within the last 240,000 years ago. agent_1:wow ;) we had fur ? ;) agent_2:What do you think animal hair is? That's why I find wearing actual animal fur so disgusting. I wouldn't wear the skin and hair of another human. Why would I want to wear the skin of an animal? agent_1:no, what I meant was - did WE - humans had fur in the past ? agent_2:Well, yes. Technically we still have fur today (although it is spotty). Fur is the covering of hair used to protect an animal and help it control its temperature and reactions to the climate. agent_1:ok...

I have heard of Tommy Orange's fiction novel about Native Americans. agent_1:That's interesting!  He is a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes.  I don't know much about those two tribes.  His book is about a boy? agent_2:Yes.  It is fiction however.  It provides insight into the challenges that the boy has in grappling with his identity.  We have a national history where many atrocities and slurs dot the history. agent_1:True!  I went to an indian reservation this past summer in New York.  It was the Seneca nation and I went through one of their museums.  They pretty much got kicked out of their land just like all the other tribes in the nation. agent_2:A people divided into tribes cannot stand against a unified enemy.  But, my wife's best friend has a Ph.D. and the government paid for all of her education because she is Cherokee.  But if one knows the facts, a lot of interesting history can be written. agent_1:Wow.  That's really interesting.  Hopefully Tommy Orange's book does well.   agent_2:Books can be fiction with a lot of facts or not so many.

The FDA also burned 6 tons of literature in an act of censorship. agent_1:I think I remember reading about that before.  Literature was an olympic event from 1912 to 1952.

Are you? agent_1:I think it's fun to read sometimes. The origins are more interesting for me. Early poems in the Eurasian content evolved from folksongs.  agent_2:I dont much about poetry. that is interesting. i guess poetry and songs would be closely related. agent_1:Yes I suppose they would. They tried to define poetry in ancient Greece such as Aristotle's poetics. It focused on the use of speech in rhetoric, drama, song, and comedy. agent_2:I guess poetry is spoken and written, so it is related to many arts. Do you have a favorite poet? agent_1:I think it's funny when comedians do poetry. I don't really have a favorite poet. Demetri Martin wrote a 224 word palindrome! agent_2:that must have taken him quite a while. 224 words, backwards and forwards? my head hurts. agent_1:Yes mine hurts just thinking about it. Edgar Allan Poe is another classic poet and he only received $9 for the publication of his poem the Raven. agent_2:He probably spent it on drugs and booze too. the man was so decadent, but maybe it inspired him.	agent_1:Yeah you probably did.

I wonder if she started seeing tetris blocks in her sleep. That happens to some people who play tetris for an extended period of time. agent_2:That is so weird! As an adult I wish i was good at Tetris when I quit smoking or trying to diet because it can offer a quick fix when people are struggling to stick to working on either. agent_1:Yeah, and they also will regularly identify tetromino shapes in real life like in patterns on buldings or in layouts of boxes. Haha, hilarous. agent_2:Okay, well then maybe I'm not so sad that I am not good at it. I would not want to deal with that. agent_1:Right? Haha. I didn't know that Tetris was actually from the Soviet Union. I thought it was just part of the Tetris design where there were Russian buildings. agent_2:Yes, Alexey Pajitinov was the original designer and programmer.	agent_1:You mentioned that Tetris can help with addictions.

5791	agent_1:hey there what do you think of the game of baseball? agent_2:Baseball is ok. I remember hearing my older relatives calling the World Series the Fall Classic. It sounds very retro. agent_1:haha that is retro, I never knew that baseball managers could start playing if they wanted to, and thats why they wear uniforms agent_2:Yes I just recently learned that, too, and thought it was very interesting! It might be like an embarrassment to the team to have to bring in a manager like that, though. What do you think? agent_1:haha ya I would think so, can you believe that baseball is super popular in Japan, I had no idea agent_2:Yea, when I worked for Target a few years ago I remember they'd have Japanese baseball on in the break room along with other TV's with American Sports. agent_1:ah that is interesting, I wish I was like the guy who found millions of dollars of baseball cards in his attic, now that would be a surprise agent_2:As long as I'm not like the guy found in a beer cooler behind a concession stand at a baseball stadium. He was found just before a braves game, too. agent_1:ya I heard about that that was crazy, did you ever play kickball as a kid? I guess it's called soccer-baseball in canada agent_2:Canadians do have some different ways about them. Soccer-baseball does sound hilarious. So does poutine, though. agent_1:haha well I do like poutine, but I think that yes soccer-baseball sounds incredibly dumb haha agent_2:I wonder if they have poutine at American baseball games? I heard they started a poutine restaurant in California.	agent_1:wow that sounds delicious right now, do you ever shop at Target btw?	agent_2 likes food. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['food', 'hobby', 'collecting'].
7002	agent_1:Did you hear about the 300 crocodiles killed in Indonesia? agent_2:Yeah I think that is sad. Us humans are invading these animals' space and we think we own the place. agent_1:I agree.  We dont even respect other humans, so animals definitely dont get any resepct.  We really need to treat every living thing with respect. agent_2:It's especially bad because it was a licensed sanctuary that Sugito wandered into to collect food. This was undoubtedly done without permission. agent_1:It is like when the kid fell into Harambe's cage.   agent_2:Right, I was mad about that one too. Police tried to stop the killings but there were 600 people so it was impossible. agent_1:That is horrible.  There are 20 quintillion (yeah that is a number) animals on earth and humans are one.  Id say we are slightly outnumbered. agent_2:Killing a protected species is a crime in Indonesia so it was just those people who were out of control. What's gross is the villagers took selfies with the crocodiles afterward. agent_1:I would get killing the one, but trying to exterminate a species because of one bad one is stupid.	agent_2:Yeah, and I still don't think it's bad because the villager wandered into its habitat. But some people did question the logic of having crocodile ponds so close to a village.	agent_1 likes environment. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['environment', 'entertainment', 'TV show'].

13766	agent_1:Hi. Did you know that moon dust can cut through kevlar like material? agent_2:No, that's fascinating. Did you know the highest point on the moon is 1938 meters taller than Mt. Everest? agent_1:I didn't know that.  It really makes you think about how it must be walking around on the moon doesn't it? agent_2:Yea, I wouldn't want to catch hay fever walking around with all that moon dust agent_1:i've heard that hay fever from moon dust is harmful to people. agent_2:I heard apollo 11 considered placing a UN flag on the moon instead of the US flag agent_1:Hmm, that could have been a good thing.  It would have included the whole planet.  What do you think? agent_2:I prefer the US flag, I mean everyone on Apollo 11 was from the US 	agent_1:True. It was definitely an American accomplishment.

3143	agent_1:Hey how is it going, you ever cook a turkey during Thanksgiving? agent_2:No, the only bird I ever cook is chicken; I'm looking to expand my skillset, though! They're the most numerically successful class of tetrapods. agent_1:Ah I gotcha, I was going to say there are some tips to maximize space in the oven during Thanksgiving, but that might just bore both of us haha. That's pretty cool about chickens, there are over 10000 birds that classify as tetrapods. agent_2:I'm sure that some like hummingbirds don't lend themselves to eating, but I know that ostrich steaks are a thing; I wonder how to cook those! I guess they can be so big because they don't fly. agent_1:True, I'm surprised they still have wings. I cannot believe how small hummingbirds are, only 2 inches! agent_2:I guess they're still evolving to the point where the wings disappear. Some birds don't get that chance--the famously extinct dodo bird is actually a sub-family a pigeon that I guess didn't evolve as much as it needed to! agent_1:Interesting, it's funny that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. That is really cool to me. agent_2:That's very resourceful. Some wild birds in Australia are resourceful in mimicking the human world sounds of cameras, car alarms, and chainsaw, although I'm not sure exactly what purpose that would serve. agent_1:I've heard that, they're pretty resourceful. I didn't know how light birds were, their skeleton is hollow and weighs less than the feathers. agent_2:Maybe that's why some birds are able to migrate from Alaska to northern Mexico without sleeping; the light weight must keep them from getting too exhausted. agent_1:That is some cardio! They all have feathers, beaked jaws, lay eggs and have a four chambered heart, I wonder how far they are from dinosaurs. agent_2:Even if they are distantly related, I bet dinosaurs didn't dance the way some birds do to impress their potential mates. They're more closely related to humans in that way. agent_1:I bet not. At least they don't have to worry about having 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week to go through like professional ballet dancers.	agent_2:That's a lot, but I guess that kind of dancing is stressful on shoes that are supporting the weight on such as small surface.

Even the ramones who toured for 20 years only played like 100 per year agent_2:Yea that's pretty amazing. I love Linkin Park.  agent_1:Also that is almost one every day. Must have been incredibly taxing agent_2:I bet. In Croatia there is an ancient amphitheater that is still in use as a venue today. agent_1:Isn't there also one in pompeii? I believe pink floyd performed there agent_2:Yes, I've seen the Pink Floyd performance in Pompeii.  agent_1:Do you mean the recording?

I guess he played for 5 different english clubs during his career.  agent_2:He sure was and wat about Eddie Johnson, his been a pro since age 16, he sure has a good level of skill agent_1:Yeah Eddie Johnson and Freddi Adu were touted as being the next big things in soccer.  They both had pretty good careers but not as big as hyped up to be.  agent_2:Well its hard since there is a lot of good players out there, sometimes its just a matter of luck , did you watch the last FIFA World Cup? agent_1:Yeah I get so excited each summer the world cup comes around.  How about you? agent_2:I did, I thought it was a great World Cup, I was rooting for Argentina but I guess France was the best team of the cup overall, I also liked how Croatia played.	agent_1:Yeah France had an amazing team and they finally played like it.

Did you also know that dogs are not color blind like most people think? agent_2:Yeah, I heard that they can see colors, not as well as we do but still in color agent_1:They also, along with elephants, are the only two animals the seem to understand pointing by instincts.  agent_2:They are definitely mart animals.  That might by Google prefers them to cats. agent_1:That is so weird, and I guess they came out and declared they were a dog company.  agent_2:Yeah.  I dont know why, but that is how they identify. agent_1:Did you know that in Istanbul, they have a vending machine for stray dogs? agent_2:Yes!  It is such a cool concepts.  Recycle bottles for  dog food.  How neat! agent_1:Yeah I think that is really cool, and I know other countries around the world have big stray dog problems.  agent_2:I think even one place in Russia dogs are trained on using the subway. agent_1:That is incredible.

I don't remember this ""monster"" thing.  I think I'm reading the exploits of a snowflake millennial.  agent_2:Mine are gen Z, (early 2000), so I don't have any experience with the 90's millennials.

They tend to exaggerate for social media. I would love to go to the unclaimed luggage store in Alabama. Maybe I could find mine from several years ago. agent_1:Yeah but I don't like it when people make it look like kids are a huge problem even if it's for their own attention.  Yeah, I probably have luggage somewhere in ATL.  agent_2:If anything, all that does is show your lack of parenting skills...and alcohol problem. agent_1:Yeah, like that's a good solution -- getting lit. Funny, polo shirts should actually be called tennis shirts because a tennis player invented them. agent_2:I prefer the office attire of Hawaii. Suits and ties are too stifling in that heat. agent_1:Amen to that.  Or maybe a colorful wardrobe full of Pilgrim clothes?  The Pilgrims got a bad rap for always wearing black.  Not true... agent_2:I like the uniform at Billy Mays' funeral. Blue shirts and khaki pants were what the pallbearers were wearing. May as well be comfortable. agent_1:Yes, that's cool.

I'm a noted tie-hater... agent_2:Are you familiar with the theory that the universe is one giant hologram? agent_1:Yes, I'm an engineer that wishes he was and astrophysicist.

I would sell some and keep some.  agent_1:ya kind of a bum move to sel all your grandpas cards, especially since theyve been there since 1940 agent_2:He might have needed the cash. Did you know that the opposing team receives three bases if a player catches a baseball in their cap? I've never heard that rule. agent_1:wow didn't know that! also didn't know baseball is super popular in Japan agent_2:Very popular, but not as good as the US version.

I can see why voter turnout has been under 70% in the past hundred years. agent_2:Yes that's true, are you plan to vote in next election? agent_1:I try to vote every time. I missed the first election when I was eligible, but the last presidential election was very interesting, so I try to research and vote every time now. agent_2:Not being personal but do you that your entire voting was negative and no positive with the president? agent_1:I definitely felt like I was voting against someone more than I was voting for someone. Was that how you felt too? agent_2:Well, I felt a little like that, My main concern is that I knew this country is going down hill with killing, drugs, rich, poor, I just wanted a change. agent_1:That's how I felt too. I think the influence of the media was a major factor. According to actual rates, it's safer than it ever was in the past, but we're able to hear about so much more. agent_2:Yes, you are right and nothing to very little is been done about it. We really need a strong and respectful leader. agent_1:Most of all we need a leader that can unify us. Elections seem so polarized lately that it will be hard to find one, though. Nobody wins if they campaign as a compromiser. agent_2:That's true, but it doesn't matter what kind of president we get, he or she will not satisfy everyone, so that's why I always say do what best for our country, this is just my opinion.  agent_1:I agree with you completely, and I appreciate the way you say it in a respectful and nonpartisan manner. The best for the country is something that everyone should strive for. agent_2:That's true such as jobs, health Insurance and so many other things.  I thinks a leader like that will be hard to find. agent_1:The difficult part is that everyone has their own idea of what's best for the country, and sometimes the politicians they agree with don't fulfill their promises. agent_2:You are right, since I was voting, Presidents speak of good things that people want to hear and after 8 years nothing change and this was going on for years. agent_1:I think it would help to get some new faces in politics and reform some of the systems that may have worked decades ago, but aren't as functional in modern times.	agent_2:Did you know since 1900, the tallest candidate has won us presidential election 75% of the time? 	agent_1 dislikes politics. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'politics', 'no'].

They said that they never had been caught until Trump's laws. agent_2:Yeah, I'm not sure if that actually made any difference. It just really sucks that even after his executive order ending the separation reuniting families is still so difficult agent_1:Yes, I know. I don't know how they are not keeping track of what child belongs to what mother. It's terrible to know that the kids were heard wailing and asking for their family members. agent_2:It's even crazier that the grandmother could recognize Ximena's voice. I guess since I've never been a parent, I can't comprehend that agent_1:You are right. Nobody knows how a parent feels until you are one. Is terrible. I myself I was thinking that I would prefer stay in my country and don't enter the USA at least while they are taking these measures. It would be terrible to lose my son or grandkid. agent_2:I understand that. I can also understand wanting to leave when there are gang members on every corner and your little one is just starting school agent_1:Yes, I understand that. It has to be very, very difficult, a terrible decision to make. But, me, personally, I would prefer to face it together than not know what happened to them. I don't know, this is a very difficult situation. agent_2:Plus, she had to leave her dog behind :( Poor little Cookie agent_1:Yes, this is such a terrible story. Well, Cindy was robbed twice on the bus. That makes it very difficult to live in a place where you don't have any safety. agent_2:I watched an episode of a TV show Shameless recently and it showed an immigrant child separated from his parents in Texas who ended up in foster care in Chicago! agent_1:I wonder why people are adopting them.

How cool is that. agent_2:I had no idea, I find it so funny that the boy from the shining had no idea he was acting in a horror movie until many years later agent_1:they do that alot with very young actors! agent_2:I had no idea, but I'm sure that would make sense since they're young and don't really know what is happening	agent_1:and that way they won't be scared so much. i think it would be good.	agent_2 likes activity. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['activity', 'family', 'family'].

It doesn't draw the attention of the World Series. agent_1:huh I'll look into it, can you believe until 2005 a husband and wife team scheduled all the MLB games? agent_2:They must have had a computer to help them. All those games? It couldn't be done on paper. agent_1:ya I agree, like 2500 games to schedule a year, that would get tedius! agent_2:I wonder how much they got paid. The Cubs haven't had much luck, have they. They were the first baseball team to win back-to-back world series; and haven't won since. agent_1:no you're right, what do you think about the Yankees? agent_2:They have too much money. In general, there is too much superstition  in baseball. Ben Affleck caused the production of Gone Girl to shut down for 4 days because he refused to wear a Yankees cap on screen. agent_1:its funny they started out as the Highlanders but changed their name in 1913 agent_2:The Yankees is a very American name. Their logo comes from a medal designed for a police officer.  agent_1:oh thats cool, wild that they have the 2nd highest attendance in the league! agent_2:The Yankees are an institution.

7632	agent_1:Do you watch Game of Thrones? agent_2:Hi, I have never seen it. What about you? agent_1:Are you kidding? its like the best show ever you should really watch it it has about 8 seasons agent_2:Haha I've been wanting to watch it. I saw Harry Lloyd is the great-great grandson of Charles Dickens. agent_1:You should watch it, and yeah the show has a great casting, its based on the novels by George R.R Martin, his a great writer.   agent_2:Very cool. I saw Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter plays Talisa. agent_1:Yeah she is one of the main characters of the show, I feel sad because the eight season is the final one so in April the beggining of the end will happen.  agent_2:Oh wow that is sad. I saw there is a Nat Geo show called Game of Lions that follows a pack of lions around. agent_1:That show must be really good, I wonder if they named the show after Game of Thrones.  agent_2:I think so. Do you know much about the universe? agent_1:I love reading about the universe its one of my passions, what about yourself?  agent_2:I feel the same way. There are scientists who think the universes evolve through natural selection like species here on Earth.  agent_1:That is an interesting theory, they might be on to something, there is also a theory that states that the universe is one giant super hologram. agent_2:Interesting...a giant hologram! I saw there are stars cold enough to be touched by human hands. agent_1:That is also a cool fact, then there's also the theory that there's only one electron in the universe. agent_2:That is a very interesting theory. Do you follow celebrities? agent_1:I do follow them, many of them make lots of money I kind of envy that agent_2:Me too. Pixar has a secret room often visited by celebrities. agent_1:It does? I wonder who has been there before, maybe Robin Williams before he past away. 	agent_2:Possibly.

13197	"agent_1:It's crazy the way technology is taking off. I was reading that robots are being created to basically be our pets. agent_2:In fact, the word ""robotics"" was invented by a person named Isaac Asimov! agent_1:They apparently even have robots that can break down a chicken with surgical precision. agent_2:Wow! talk about accuracy! The curiosity robot on mars sings happy birthday to itself. It must be very lonely. agent_1:Apparently, robots can be controlled by rat brains and its personality changes depending on which rat is controlling it! agent_2:Human thoughts can also control robots. This paralyzed woman has a robotic arm that she can control with her thoughts. agent_1:Apparently, the military just uses an Xbox controller. agent_2:Artificial intelligence is similar to robots. Artificial intelligence are now able to self drive cars. agent_1:Very cool. Michael Jackson wanted to buy a giant moon walking robot to moon walk around Las Vegas. agent_2:Haha. Did you know that Amazon holds a patent on one click buying? agent_1:I'd love to be Amazon's first customer.

3869	agent_1:Hello, did you know the dodo bird is actual a sub-family of the pigeon. agent_2:I didn't know that- of course I believe the bird is extinct, isn't it?  This year we recently had a bunch of hummingbirds..that was a first for me and so exciting. SO TINY.. agent_1:I also find it interesting that some birds can fly from alaska to north america without sleeping when they migrate. agent_2:Birds are very interesting because of a lot of facts.  I think it helps with their flight that their bones are hollow so not weighed down.  agent_1:Yes, they are interesting. I did not know that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. I find that very interersting. agent_2:I have watched them pull some to make them nearby.  The way they flit about is so beautiful to watch.  It is almost elegant like a dance. ..performing art! agent_1:Yes, did you know that Jackie Chan manages a k-pop band. I did not know that but i think it's cool. agent_2:It seems that so many you wouldn't think to have other interests do.  Jackie in music, Bruce Lee in dancing.  A championship even! agent_1:It seems to be in a kpop band you have to be tough because they go through bootcamps before being signed. agent_2:Boot camps for bands.. Guess it takes a lot of stamina for the dancing and singing.  Kind of the same I would assume for figure skating.  Can you imagine the work to land a triple axel? agent_1:That is true. It looks hard. Did you know babies spontaneously dance when they hear music. They are cute. agent_2:Music is a wonderful thing, so much to come out of it.  Symbiotic relationship with dance and music. Tupac was able to do both- never would have thought ballet for him though. agent_1:Yes, that definitely does not fit his image. I was surprised that ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week. That is a lot. agent_2:The tip starts to break down and doesn't hold form.  Same with skates, have to keep them sharp or can't get the edge for spins and jumps. Would have to assume that Nagasu goes through a lot of skates for this reason. agent_1:I like that she wanted to do the triple axel so bad that she dreamed she could . That shows heart for wanting to do something. agent_2:Especially when she had been passed over for the previous Olympics.  Rippon omitted his quad jump at the start, not as much heart I guess. agent_1:And she is part of the record books for being the first U.S. lady to land triple axel in olympic competition. agent_2:She had her wish of making America proud.  Guess the same can't be said for the Russians because of the prior doping scandal.	agent_1:Yes, the doping scandal can be hard to come back from.

Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis by famous player rene ""the crocodile"" lacoste and only later adopted by polo players agent_2:I once watched a match where single point lasted nearly 30 minutes. It was historic agent_1:Wow, They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 us open agent_2:I remember when players could use just about everything for a racket except the kitchen sink agent_1:Haha, The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days. agent_2:Do you know who played in that match? agent_1:No, I sure don't.  I bet they were worn out though. agent_2:Tennis players make quite a bit of money if they win a tournament but not as much as soccer players agent_1:Yes, they do.  On another note, did you know that the rapper drake graduated high school on october 2012 at the age of 25 agent_2:That is a little late isn't it or do Canadians graduate at a later age? agent_1:Haha, that is very late.  Probably a ssllooww learner.

The country is a crazy place lately.  agent_1:I agree. There hasn't been a US president who wasn't a rep or dem since 1853. agent_2:Wow, I guess that doesn't surprise me lol. Did you know the use of RED and BLUE for each party color only began in 2000? Weird agent_1:Oh wow I didn't know that. I saw that Ronald Reagan compaiged for democrats. agent_2:That's odd, he wasn't a Democrat, interesting. i didn't know that. agent_1:Very interesting I think. 15% of the tea party movement identify themselves as democrats. agent_2:Interesting! I was watching a vlog on Youtube who was talking about how many people are not Democrats or Republicans.

Are you Clint Eastwood? LOL. I've never ridden a horse, but they seem like majestic animals. agent_2:I wish I were Clint Eastwood! But I never knew that Iceland actually has a specific horses with a fifth speed, other horses do not have this ability for some reason agent_1:I don't understand the speeds. Trot, gallop, ??? What else is there? agent_2:yes its something called Tolt, I don't know exactly how fast that is though lol agent_1:I guess they have used horses there for many purposes. What do you think of the two high school students who rode their horses to school on 'no vehicles to school day', and got suspended? agent_2:I think that was genius but pretty dumb that they got suspended haha. What do you think about Dalmatians? Do you know how they are related to horses agent_1:I know that they are used by firefighters. I heard that they were deaf or something. agent_2:Yes a lot of them are actually deaf. What do you think about Elon Musk by the way? I know that's a change of topic haha agent_1:That is a change of topic. He is not a dalmatian, or a horse, or deaf. I think that he is ambitious and trying to create new technology.

I also read that the original light saber that he used is in the space station. agent_1:thats some cool stuff. It seems to be an extremely well-liked franchise, I personally really like how the writers changed up the script so the secret of darth vader being Luke's father wouldn't be leaked  agent_2:I never knew that there was a radio broadcast of the film in 1981.  It would be fun to listen to as a podcast now. agent_1:Agreed! though 5 hours is a little long of my liking lol agent_2:I knew that luke was a twin to Princess Leia but i can't keep up with the other relatives and relationships. I would have to binge watch all of the movies. agent_1:that's going to take you a few days to do! It's cool how scientists have discovered a planters that has the ""building blocks of life"". Maybe the star wars franchise depicts what the entire universe would look like in a few hundred years agent_2:That would be amazing. The UN made an ambassador of extraterrestrials incase we ever make contact with any. Ha! agent_1:ahaha very true. The UN definitely knows something that the rest of us don't. Seems like an odd job to have, how would you even have the qualifications for something like that agent_2:And are they really paid? Who knows? Are you interested in Earth science? Did you know that when the earth was first formed, a day was only 5 and half hours long? agent_1:how would you even communicate with ""aliens"", i doubt they would speak a recognizable language lol if they already created this positions maybe we'll have contact with extraterrestrials sooner than we thought. If they came to earth do you think it'd be a friendly visit? and yes I am! so cool! agent_2:I have watch enough science fiction movies. It seems that other beings would be more advanced than we are.We seem to not be able to solve global warming. The earth is 71% water and I am afraid the polar ice caps are melting! agent_1:yeah thats a common theme i noticed in movies too! They're much more advanced and powerful, yet humans always seem to win the battle some way. But maybe aliens would be chill and would want peace with humans. You're so right, and to think that there are people who don't believe in global warming agent_2:I also read that 80 % of the earths forests have already been destroyed. Very sad agent_1:Seems like we're destroying Earth very quickly. the article mentioned that human's existence would represent 1 minute and 17 seconds in comparison to earth's entire history. Yet already we've done so much damage  agent_2:We really do have an amazing planet in that it sustains life but  there are so many planets in the universe. I wonder how uranus rolls around the sun rather than spins? agent_1:Honestly to think about how any of this exists is amazing. have you read that there's a planet with pieces of glass that perpetuate sideways at 4500mph? that almost sounds made up  agent_2:That is not something I have never heard. The fact that building blocks of life we detected 455 light years away is difficult to fathom. agent_1:Maybe there's a planet in our universe that also has living life forms. It's interesting how Venus doesn't title so therefore it has no seasons agent_2:Also I had known that Jupiter had moons but that one of them would be considered a planet if it rotated around the sun is pretty cool. agent_1:Funny how the definition of ""planets"" is controversial and how Pluto is technically no longer considered as one agent_2:That involves a lot of updating of text books! agent_1:I guess this is just the natural progression of science. definitions will change and we'll continue to discover new things agent_2:It has been nice chatting! agent_1:yes! enjoy the rest of the day! agent_2:Thanks!"	agent_1:thanks!	agent_2 likes greeting. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['greeting', 'movie', 'movie character'].

The universe is certainly fascinating. agent_2:It is indeed, have you ever observed Mars in the sky ? NASA wants to send people there in 20-25 years.  agent_1:I have a few times, but never by telescope or anything like that.  I have heard that a colonization project was planned for 2023 and was going to be funded by making some sort of reality show.  That would be a fun one to watch. agent_2:There is a few contests about the colonization of Mars, NASA has also one, you have to submit a concept for  a house on Mars.  agent_1:the 3.15 million dollar prize would be a nice one to win for that.  I would love to see humans make it to mars in my life time.  I wonder if the first country there would try to claim it as their territory. agent_2:I don't think they will claim to Mars, it will be more like the Moon, even Antarctica does not belong to a country.   agent_1:True.  It is also crazy that a satellite was lost on Mars because Locheed Martin used the imperial system but NASA used metric.  How could they not get that detail in order? agent_2:Locheed is a big company based in the US. The Imperial system is still used there, maybe they had an European subcontractor and units got mixed up.   agent_1:Very possible. I think it is neat that the planets are named after Roman Gods and Goddesses.  With Mars being the God of War   agent_2:It has a reddish tone, it is the most war-like planet. It is crazy that some of Earth's bacteria could live on Mars.   agent_1:That gives promise that Mars could become sustainable for earth life.   agent_2:Would you go live on Mars ? - 81 °F is too cold for me.  agent_1:Id seriously have to bundle up.  I live in Florida, so it gets in the 20s here and I start to freeze.   agent_2:Maybe it is something that will have all have to do, Earth has already lost 80 % of its natural forest.  agent_1:It is amazing that in humans short period on earth we have done so much damage to the natural resources on the planet.  I mean if earths entire history was put in to one 24 hour period, humans have only been here less than two minutes. agent_2:But humans have a big impacts on Earth'S ressources, at this rate there won't be any Helium left at the end of the 21st century.  agent_1:That's crazy, I cant believe that people aren't actively trying to stop some of this, or those that do are met with such opposition.  I mean if there is a UN ambassador to extraterrestrial life we can certainly advocate for saving this planet. agent_2:I wonder if they choose someone serious, or the most incompetent guy in the UN since he won't probably won't ever have any real responsibilities. 	agent_1:That's a good question, never thought about that.

Do you know why managers wear uniforms? agent_2:Yep, because they are technically able to play for their team if the need arises. I don't recall ever seeing one play though. agent_1:That's correct. I've never seen it happen either.  agent_2:I've heard that up from 1981 until 2005 a married couple actually scheduled all 2,430 major league games played each year. agent_1:Wow! That's some serious devotion to the game.  agent_2:Yeah it is. I find it fascinating that baseball is so popular in Japan. I remember watching games when I was stationed there and the crowds were amazing, even for small local games. agent_1:I had heard that it was so huge over there that they are surprised that it is our past time.  agent_2:Did you ever collect baseball cards? agent_1:I did not. How about you? agent_2:I collected them with my dad when I was a kid. I wish I could have found a collection like this one man did. He found three million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfather's attic. They had been hidden since the 1940s. agent_1:Wow! That's amazing. I wish I came across something like that myself.  agent_2:Do you know that kickball is called soccer-baseball in Canada?  agent_1:I did not.

I wonder why he went from medicine to humor? It's a good thing because he saved the woman in the story. agent_1:Yes, I heard about this awhile back.  A women was having a seizure.  He first thought she was a heckler. agent_2:Hecklers are not funny at all. I went to a comedy show where there were several and they ruined the whole performance. I don't think I could be a comedian you have to have a tough skin. He is good, though. agent_1:It is said that once he realized what was going on, he jumped off stage and into action. agent_2:I suspect that the training never leaves you. I would rather be a doctor but I guess he does really well acting. Comedy is a lot of fun if you don't hurt other people with jokes.	agent_1:I'm sure he makes more as a comedian and actor.

Jack Black was going to star in the Green Lantern which was originally supposed to be a comedy.   agent_1:I think it would have been better as a comedy. I like Jack Black movies. agent_2:I love them!  He cracks me up.  I like corny goofball comedy.  I used to like watching 3rd Rock from the Sun when it was on tv for that same reason. agent_1:Yeah I liked the goofy brother. Dont remember his name. I thought he was funny. agent_2:Yes.

11597	agent_1:I recently learned that the earth is the densest planet in the solar system.  I wonder if that helps it to support all of the water on it. agent_2:That is one possibility. Water is a very important resource that helps give life on earth. agent_1:Yes it does and the earth's surface is covered by about 71% of water.  The polar regions are covered in ice but that is just frozen water so-more water on the earth's surface.	agent_2:That is true although I am not much into the science of earth.

10497	agent_1:Hi, do you use Amazon? agent_2:Hi, are you interested in Google, Amazon, or Artificial Intelligence? agent_1:All three of those actually. They are two of the biggest innovators we have and one of the most interesting scientific fields. agent_2:Yes, I agree. I really enjoy AI although all three of these topics are probably so interrelated that we don't realize it. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is sometimes called machine intelligence (which is actually demonstrated by the machines) in contrast to human intelligence. agent_1:Yes it is amazing what we can hopefully apply AI to in the future. It can really help out with some difficult tasks. agent_2:I took Computer Science in college and it is defined as the study of 'intelligent agents' or any device that perceives the environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. agent_1:I only took a basic Computer Science course, we never delved into Artificial Intelligence. I don't know too much about it besides some basic reading. agent_2:I learned some stuff in Master's level courses and colloquially, the term 'artificial intelligence' is applied when a machine mimics 'cognitive functions' that humans associate with other human minds such as 'learning' and 'problem solving'. agent_1:What do you think the biggest priority should be in the application of Artificial Intelligence? agent_2:Actually, the scope of AI is disputed as machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered as requiring 'intelligence' are often removed from the definition, a phenomenon known as the AI effect, leading to the quip in Teslar's Theorem, 'AI is whatever hasn't been done yet.' agent_1:I know some people are afraid of AI and think machines will become too self aware. I don't think we will ever run into that problem, science fiction has made people too paranoid. agent_2:I totally agree with that since machines are run on computer programs that humans wrote.  Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems such as chess and Go. agent_1:I know I have lost my fair share of chess games to a computer, I even saw a computer compete at very high levels at Jeopardy. It only slipped up when questions were worded somewhat ambiguously. agent_2:Yes, computers could NEVER actually think like humans can although they can autonomously operate cars, provide intelligent routing in content delivery networks and military simulations. agent_1:Yes they can really help us out when the task is something that lends itself to automation but not when there are moral or ethical complications. agent_2:Very true. Did you know that Stanford's free AI class uses Google plus Hangouts to help them teach more effectively? agent_1:I did not know that, I have used Google Hangouts for interviews and meetings. We even used it once for a fantasy football draft that a lot of people couldn't attend in person. agent_2:Awesome use of it. Did you know that there is a non-profit organization for the advancement of Artificial Intelligence? agent_1:That's great, it's an area that we should definitely fund as there are a lot of great applications of the technology. Just the medical field alone could immensely benefit from it.	agent_2:I agree, even Facebook is developing an AI designed to understand user emotions, identify objects in photos, and predict user actions.	agent_1 likes technology. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['technology', 'hobbies', 'hobbies'].

Did you know ballet dancers can go through four pairs of pointe shoes in a week. agent_1:if i were a dancer, i would go through a dozen. LOL. i cannot dance. really. agent_2:Me too! Did you know Michael Jackson has a patent? agent_1:is that the patent on the shoes for that special lean? he really was a genius. agent_2:It was a device used to achieve the extreme lean in some of his dance moves. agent_1:yeah, thats it! i was never any good at dancing. i wonder if you have to start when youre young. agent_2:Well, I know babies spontaneously dance when they hear music. Maybe the better dancers heard a lot of music when they were younger. agent_1:i wonder if i heard enough music. maybe that was it. maybe i missed by window. oh well. agent_2:Yeah, maybe. I know they smile more when they hit the bet. agent_1:I use smile when i hit a bet too.

I guess they found one on the southern Border in Texas, a bag with a baby tiger that is agent_2:Was it a smuggling thing? agent_1:Yes I think so unfortunately. the smuggling industry is a billion dollar trade unfortunately agent_2:With 20 quintillion animals in this world, why would anyone feel the need to smuggle one? agent_1:Haha well different animals are definitely worth different amounts, I don't think a mosquito is worth anything LOL. Why do you think animals can get white patches on their foreheads? agent_2:Once domesticated, animals develop white patches on their foreheads, likely because once indoors, they run into painted walls and doors with their heads. I know i do. agent_1:Haha I wonder if humans developed these white patches as well. What do you think about Germany giving constitutional rights to animals? They did that back in 2002 agent_2:I think German constitutional right for animals are pretty cool. Pretty, pretty . I learned about that while watching the German remake of the classic film, ""12 angry hamsters"" agent_1:Well I'll have to watch that movie. I just think it's cool that hiccups are relics of When Animals had both lungs and gills, so next time you have the hiccups think about that LOL agent_2:Does that mean putting a bag over your head while hiccupping may cause you to de-evolve? Maybe that is what happened to the Loch Ness Monster! I'm glad  she is a protected species. Hate to think someone might bag Aunt Matilda.  agent_1:It's funny that it's protected by 1912 Scottish law, the ""protection of animals act"". hopefully that means that it's a real animal LOL but I doubt it agent_2:Yeah. Aunt Matilda would make a better hag fish anyway, or maybe a seahorse, since they are the only fish with a neck.  agent_1:That is crazy! I also think it's crazy that there is a jellyfish breed that can never die AKA its immortal agent_2:Does that mean they never get cancer, or they get cancer forever? You know, 84% of genes associated with human disease are also found in the zebrafish, but I have never seen a zebrafish with MS or Parkinson's disease... agent_1:Haha I haven't seen it either! Maybe some people have the black swallower fish disease, because black swallow fish Can Eat Prey twice their length and 10 times their weight haha agent_2:Haha. If  freshwater fish can drink through it's skin, why don't you ever see a freshwater fish floating in a margarita?"	agent_1:Haha I wish I could drink through my skin and float in a margarita LOL.

Supposedly she is the youngest self made billionaire ever. agent_2:Yeah I do not know anything about her.  Did you know there was a dwarf planet between Mars and Jupiter?  I had never heard of it agent_1:Kylie Jenner is one of the Kardashians, I believe. I never knew about the dwarf planet between Mars and Jupiter! Does it have a name? agent_2:I am not sure of its name.   I do know that the sunset on Mars is blue!  Is that not weird? agent_1:That would be pretty neat to see!

Speaking of movies, Black Panther has the richest superhero out there, worth $500 billion! agent_2:That's a lot of money. They are re-releasing th emovie for free from February 1 - 7 for african american month... agent_1:Wow!! Thats amzinzing. I know there was a lot of confusion when the movie was first released...many people confused it with the black panther party.  agent_2:Yeah, they are a lot different. T'challa is the richest superhero/ agent_1:That's interesting! You know, there's a lot that we can do with this extra day off with the cold and all...we have the whole day to indulge. Did you know that when the Earth was first formed, a day was only 5.5 hours long? agent_2:I had no idea. I do know that I am working on this cold day and worked out this morning. It has been a cold day! agent_1:Yes it has. The weather and the earth's atmosphere is forever changing. By the 21st century, we anticipate running out of Helium. That's going to significantly impact human life...scary!! agent_2:How is it going to impact humans> I am curious to know more!	agent_1:Well, for one, Helium makes up a large portion of our atmosphere.

But any concert that they ever played would be really cool to attend.  agent_1:Yes, they have the best shows that I have seen. Aerosmith puts on a great concert too. agent_2:That sounds good as well.  I really like the Apples in Stereo, they put on a good show.  Radiohead was really good as well, although I really went to see the opening band, thats sad but true.  agent_1:I love Radihead, who was the opening band at that concert? agent_2:Yeah they are awesome, and I wasn't aware of how little they toured!

The only thing I know about it, is that it's a drama show. agent_1:I've watched it a few times, it's a pretty good show.I've never seen the National Geographic show called Game of lions, though.  Have you? agent_2:No, I can't say that I have. I haven't even heard of that either. What did you like about Game of Thrones? agent_1:I like fantasy type shows and this one has a large cast with several plot lines going on at the same time.  It holds your interest and is never boring. Scenery is beautiful, it gets filmed in Ireland, Canada Iceland, Malta Scotland, Spain, and the U.S. agent_2:I think the only guy I really know from the show is Peter Dinklage because he won an Emmy for being on the show. agent_1:Well. Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter plays Talis on the show, also. agent_2:That is interesting! The show comes on HBO right? I'll have to check it out sometime. agent_1:Yes, it does.  Just binge watch it, all seven seasons.  The eighth season doesn't premiere until April, so you have some time to get up to speed, it's worth watching! agent_2:Eight seasons? That means it came out in 2011. That is a long time for a show to be on and still being successful. agent_1:Yeah, that long.  It has a big following, so much so that Arya the name of one of the characters is the fastest rising baby name for girls in the U.S. agent_2:That is a little disturbing. Not sure I would name my kid from a TV show. I think the actor that played Arya was actually her first role in anything. agent_1:I know right.  I wouldn't either, but some people are very big fans. Lol agent_2:I'm not that big of a fan of anything. Lots of celebrities are overrated. In 2007 Paris Hilton was voted the most overrated celebrity. agent_1:Me either and I remember when Paris Hilton was everywhere.  I wish the Kardashians would go the same way.  They are way overrated, as well.   agent_2:Yeah, the Kardashians are the very definition of celebrity. They garner so much public attention by mass media and I have no clue what they are actually known for. agent_1:I don't think nobody does. Lol Do you know that Robin Williams started the trens of celebrities doing the voices in animated movies?

And then they run around the bases, if they are lucky enough to hit said ball. agent_1:Yeah that is true. It's crazy that baseball managers can actually join in the game, that's why they wear uniforms agent_2:Yes, if they need to play for their teams, I dont know why that would happen, but it might be fun to watch! agent_1:Yeah that could be cool. It's also cool that a man found millions of dollars worth of old baseball cards in his attic haha his grandfather and put them there and I guess forgotten about them? agent_2:Maybe, I should start checking my attic and see what treasures are stored up there.  I might have an early retirement.   agent_1:Haha yes I hope so! You know what is weird though? Have you ever played the game kickball, apparently it's called soccer-baseball in Canada for some reason agent_2:I guess it is a pretty accurate name too, however I much prefer kickball. agent_1:Uranium kickball sounds a lot better haha. What do you think about the Japanese? Apparently they are shocked to learn that baseball is actually America's pastime and was not invented in Japan agent_2:It is surprising, I bet they wonder why they are not invited to the world series either. agent_1:Haha yes I bet! I think it's interesting that the Women's World Cup higher television ratings than the World Series. I don't like soccer myself. agent_2:I would actually say I am a bigger soccer fan than Baseball.  Especially when it comes to world cups. agent_1:Yeah I don't really like either game haha. It is crazy though that the World Series actually started back in 1903, so I do respect its long history. agent_2:The cubs won the first back to back series and then didnt win again until 2016.  That is a long time. agent_1:Yeah that is a long time, and apparently the Ottoman Empire was still a thing back when they first one at haha agent_2:Wow, I guess I hadnt realized they had overlapped.  Did you hear about how they were ""cursed"" agent_1:yes I heard about that! Its great that they finally broke the curse and 5 million people were celebrating in the streets! agent_2:Supposedly it was one of the largest gatherings in Human history. agent_1:ya you're right, I do like that they have employed handicapped players, they have had pitchers with 4,5 and 6 fingers!  agent_2:That is really cool.

He was a fantastic martial artist. Did you know that Tupac danced ballet in high school? agent_1:Yeah!  He was the mouse king in the Nutcracker.  Thats pretty cool, I would definitely never have guessed that about him. agent_2:Neither did I. That is insane because Tupac was a famous rapper.  agent_1:He was indeed, his music is even in the library of congress. agent_2:I didn't know this thanks for sharing. agent_1:Sure thing!  Did you hear about Michael Jackson's special patent shoes? agent_2:No. I know that Michael Jackson was a fantastic dancer but can you tell me more about his patent shoes if you don't mind. agent_1:There was a specific device in his shoes that helped with his extreme lean in some dance moves. agent_2:Wow!!!

It'll be funded by a reality show based off the project. I would love to see something like that! agent_2:It would be nice to see indeed, although Im not sure if they are going to make, its going to be interesting since episode 1 agent_1:Agreed. That is a pretty major undertaking, I would be surprised if it worked out. Do you know any cool facts about Mars or Earth? I know a little bit. It's terrible, over 80% of the natural forests on Earth have been destroyed, I think mostly by humans. agent_2:That is a lot of trees!! we are seriously abusing the planet, it's curious how a day lasted 5.5 hours at the begining of earths creation agent_1:That's so interesting! I guess the Earth was a lot smaller then. Sometimes I think about whether there's life beyond Earth. The UN actually appointed an official ambassador to Extraterrestrials in the event that ETs ever made contact with humans. agent_2:Thats interesting, I think there is life outside earth, the universe is just too big.  agent_1:Agreed. Even if there's no other life in our Solar System, I have to believe that somewhere in the entire vast universe that life exists. Humans definitely have a fascination with the idea of ET life. It's interesting how sometimes people are scared of aliens (like in the movie Alien) and sometimes people see aliens as friends (like the movie ET) agent_2:And I bet aliens are totally different from what we have imagined, I would like to go to Jupiter it has a moon that could be considered a planet agent_1:Wow, that must be really large! I think I heard it would be a planet if it orbited the sun, but since it just orbits Jupiter it doesn't qualify as one. Moons are so powerful, Earth's moon is what causes the tides and stabilizes Earth's axis you know. agent_2:I know! our moon influences life on earth in many ways, we sure are lucky to have one. 	agent_1:Yes. I wonder what life would be like without the moon. You know there was a red moon the other week? I saw it through a telescope and it was so beautiful.

12824	agent_1:hey my friend did you ever see the movie Jaws? agent_2:I did, I thought it was scary back in the day, what are your thoughts on the movie? agent_1:oh its scary and its a classic, and I guess the director played the clarinet in the soundtrack agent_2:Yeah I heard Spielberg played the clarinet, I must say he is pretty good, never imagined it was him agent_1:did you see the movie o brother where art thou? Directed by the coens? agent_2:No, I think I didnt watch that one, who is Coens?  agent_1:theyre brothers that direct movies together, but anyway the soundtrack is good it was certified platinum 8 times agent_2:It was pretty good, scary as well, I think the soundtrack is one of the most important factors for the success of the movie agent_1:oh ya definitely, do you like Phil collins btw? agent_2:I do like him, he recorded the sountrack for Tarzan right? agent_1:ya he did, in like 5 different foreign languages too, that's impressive! agent_2:It is impressive he must be really smart, that's not an easy feat	agent_1:no I agree, I would definitely have gone right for the professionals, I wouldn't have stayed in college haha	agent_2 likes work. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['work', 'movie', 'movie title'].
13076	agent_1:Hi, how are you? agent_2:I am ok. Have you visited Aspen Colorado? agent_1:I have not. Have you? Why just ok? agent_2:No, I have visited Denver, Colorado, but not Aspen, Colorado. agent_1:Me too! What would be the three meals you would have? agent_2:I did order a bagel, meal balls and I love cheesecake, what about you? agent_1:Probably some protein like steak and a bunch of carbs. The egg and bacon bagel sounds really good though... agent_2:I guess Aspen and Denver Colorado are a lot the same, both places have lots of mountains great for skiing. agent_1:Yeah. Do you ski? agent_2:Very little, but I fell several times before getting the hang of it, what about you? agent_1:Not since 8th grade. I had a spill and didn't see the fun in it after that. I do love winter though. Do you enjoy the winter and snow? agent_2:Yes, I love the winter and snow, that is why I will like to visit Aspen, Colorado. agent_1:Very nice. Where are you originally from? Im from chicago... agent_2:I am from Las Vegas. Do you see and like different types of birds? agent_1:I do. What about you? The famously extinct dodo bird is actually a sub-family of pigeon. agent_2:I like birds a lot. I once owned a parakeet. agent_1:Nice.

1230	agent_1:Did you know that summer was considered a bad time to release a movie? agent_2:In the past it may have been.  agent_1:Yes, it was until Jaws was released. That was a scary movie back in the day. agent_2:Yeah, that was a good movie. Did you like it?  agent_1:I use to. I think I have seen it too many times now. Spielberg played the clarinet for the soundtrack. agent_2:Yeah, that is pretty interesting. Did you see the Goonies?  agent_1:I have. That is a cute movie. I love how they get the jewels at the end to pay the mortgage. agent_2:It is pretty good. I'm fairly certain Stranger Things is a rip off of it.  agent_1:I've never seen that movie. There are so many rip-offs these days. agent_2:It is a show on Netflix actually. The first season isn't that bad.  agent_1:I don't have Netflix. These days, I'm sure that sounds weird. agent_2:I don't either. I saw it at a friends house.  agent_1:I heard that Netflix is losing a lot of money because of password sharing. Did you know Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office star? I would believe it. agent_2:Yeah, that could be, they are creating a lot of their own content. 	agent_1:All the streaming channels seem to be doing that now.	agent_2 dislikes TV. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV', 'movie', 'movie series'].
4662	agent_1:Hi there! Do you think voting is important? agent_2:No today i don't, sorry i think it's all rigged.What about you?  agent_1:Yeah, sadly, I feel the same. Maybe the system still needs to be developed. Up until 1918 not all men in UK had the vote. agent_2:Right i heard that. Did you know astronauts get to vote from space?  agent_1:Neat! And in India they even set up a voting booth for one voter in area saturated with lions. agent_2:Guess they did want him to vote. That sounds unusually cruel.  agent_1:I wonder if in India they vote what to name their garbage dumps. In Austin, Texas they voted to name theirs after Fred Durst. agent_2:Wow that is to funny, i wonder why? Another unfortunate fact is that 34% of black males will never have the chance to vote agent_1:That's sad. And a lot of eligible voters do not show up. The turnout for presidential elections has not reached 63 percent in the last 100 years. agent_2:Right! heres an interesting fact since 1900 the taller candidate has always won. agent_1:Wow! So officials in Ancient Athens were appointed by lottery. They thought elections would cause oligarchy. And knowing the fact you just told me doesn't make me have faith in the system either! agent_2:It' supposed to be a formal group decision making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office. We know it;s not.  agent_1:Do you think they should add a none of these candidates voting option for all elections? agent_2:I'm on the fence about that. I know Nevada has it but i wonder what the benefits are beside knowing who voted and who didn't.	agent_1:Yeah, there needs to be electoral reform, so that fair electorial systems are put in place.	agent_2 likes politics. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'politics', 'no'].

Animals and plants synthesize their own vitamin c, But humans cannot. agent_2:That sure is an interesting fact, you know humans can regrow ribs and they will be as strong as before in about 2-3 months agent_1:Yes, But there is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans. agent_2:I bet that frequency is used a lot in horror films.	agent_1:Yes.

9460	agent_1:Hey how often do use the internet? I know that I'm using it right now haha agent_2:I use it really often and Im using it right now as well lol so a lot  agent_1:Well I personally like clicking on hamburger buttons, they're the buttons that are made of three horizontal lines,+ the name makes me hungry agent_2:That makes me hungry as well, crazy how only 7% of the people read the terms on a service or product on the net agent_1:Yeah I know that I never read them haha. If you went on Mount Everest would you take a selfie at the top? Apparently they have 3-g service there agent_2:That would be great, taking a selfie in the top of the tallest mountain, I didnt know you could get addicted to the internet agent_1:I did know that, I'm probably addicted right now haha. And yes if you use the internet too much you can get addicted to clicking links agent_2:That is just crazy, its a good thing there a copy stored in the library of Alexandria, I cant imagine my life without the internet now agent_1:No I agree with you. I wonder how often they back it up at the Alexandria library though? Do you believe that there is extraterrestrial life in the galaxy? agent_2:I do, we are not alone in the world, the universe is so big that there must be alien life in other planets, galaxies agent_1:Yes I think you're right. Have you heard of the Drake equation? It's an equation that calculates the probability that life exists outside of hours in the universe and I think that it has determined that there should be life there somewhere agent_2:No havent heard of it, and then I agree with that equation, there are firefighters that are trained on how to treat aliens in case of a crash or an invasion agent_1:Well that's pretty cool. Did you ever hear of the show X-Files? Apparently in that show aliens began to colonize Earth back in 2012, so maybe they already are here haha agent_2:I used to love that show, and who knows maybe they are I try to keep an open mind about that agent_1:Yes it's best to keep an open mind. What do you think about Tom Cruise? Did you know he built a 10 million dollar bunker in his basement to protect him from Aliens LOL agent_2:I think he is a great actor, he definitely has the money to do that, I think his a bit too paranoid though agent_1:Yep it seems like a really weird thing to buy, have you seen the movie Aliens though? Apparently those aliens were based off of deep sea creatures agent_2:Wow, those creatures must be really scary Im guessing you also like astronomy right? agent_1:Yes I definitely like astronomy, what about you? Did you know that after they created Wi-Fi, they were able to use that technology to improve astronomy and imaging in outer space agent_2:That is amazing, I dint know that but I can see how the net has improved many things, astronomy one of them	agent_1:I agree, do you like Bill Nye the Science Guy?

13485	agent_1:Hello. Can you believe The Onion voted Kum Jong Un as the sexiest man alive, and China actually believed that nonsense? agent_2:No way! I didn't see that! I love reading articles about that part of the world, though. Like, did you read about the missile alert in Hawaii? agent_1:Yes, I remember when that happened. The entire state thought they were being attacked by North Korea. agent_2:I bet he won't shoot a missile! agent_1:I don't put anything past him. Even though we don't know how old he is, he is very intelligent and knows his way around arms. agent_2:You're right about that. He may not make the rational decisions you might expect from other leaders. agent_1:He does have a degree in physics, that alone makes him dangerous, when you factor in all the military equipment he has to play with. agent_2:In addition to the physics degree, he received one as at a military university. Plus, since his father and grandfather were leaders, you might assume that he has been aware of military and political strategies from a very young age, don't you think? agent_1:I don't know. DPK is such a secretive country. Supposedly, he learned how to drive at 3. agent_2:At 3?! I wonder if he missed out on his childhood experiences, and that is why he is spending so much money on renovating theme parks in North Korea? agent_1:I honestly don't know much about the country, or him. I'm still marveling that trump met with him. agent_2:Indeed! I truly didn't think that 2018 would see a US President visit with the North Korean leader, or that  the North Korean leader would visit South Korea for the first time since the end of the Korean War. What a strange year. agent_1:In Hawaii, the official business shirt is an aloha shirt. Much better look than a suit and tie, in the tropics, have you been? agent_2:Is that right? I didn't know that. I have never visited Hawaii yet. I hope to go some day. It would take a long time though. Did you know air travel is actually slower now than in the 1960's to save on fuel costs? agent_1:I didn't know that. I know that Japan is crazy expensive to travel, as they have mainly toll roads.	agent_2:I didn't know about the toll roads. I visited Japan and only took trains. there is a website for people that will let you crash on their couch while you're traveling.

Did you know Tupac was a ballet dancer? agent_1:Yes and he even was in the production of the nutcracker agent_2:Yeah. Ballet dancer go through 4 pairs of shoes a week agent_1:Yes that is a lot of shoes and also a lot of money agent_2:Yeah true. Did you know babies are really good at dancing? agent_1:Yes and they smile more when they hit the beat agent_2:Yeah they are much smarter than we give them credit for agent_1:True Did you know Jackson had a patent on a dancing device? agent_2:Yes it helped him smooth out his dance moves agent_1:Nice. Do you like Shakespeare? agent_2:Yes I do. Do you know that he popularized many phrases agent_1:Yes like good riddance, in my heart of hearts and such agent_2:Yes and then he also invented names like Jessica, Olivia and Miranda agent_1:Yes. And for his works you have to use old english for it to make sense agent_2:Yes otherwise the rhymes and puns do not seem to work out agent_1:Yes.

9479	"agent_1:Did you know in the ""x-files"" aliens begin their colonization of earth on December 22, 2012? agent_2:I had no idea! I've never watched the show, but I wonder if it gives you tips on what to do in case of an invasion? I understand there are some firefighters that are trained to treat aliens. agent_1:I used to watch the show. Pretty weird that Tom Cruise has a $10 million underground bunker to protect himself from aliens.  agent_2:It is curious. I mean, since the leader of his religion is an alien, as I understand it, you'd think he'd be okey doke with aliens. agent_1:Crazy, what religion is he?  agent_2:Scientology. It's a mix of sci-fi and self help, with a nice dose of pyramid scheme added in.  agent_1:Oh yeah, I've seen shows on that. That is crazy. I wonder if they could make a franchise out of that similar to the Alien's movie franchise.  agent_2:With aliens from the deep? I'd love that. Of course, the Scientology aliens come from volcanoes, which is a whole other...thing. agent_1:That would be a pretty cool movie. They could even have a cameo from Bill Nye the science guy! agent_2:Aw, he's the best! He's the executive director of the Planetary Society! I love astronomy. agent_1:I used to watch his show a lot. Did you know that the Ancient babylonians had a sophisticated understanding of astronomy?  agent_2:I'm not surprised. Once you observe the sky regularly, you start to see where everything is. I'd like to go to the place in Iran they call astronomy town. They've cut back on light pollution to see the sky better.  agent_1:Interesting. Were you aware that only 7% of people read the ToA for a product off of the internet. Seems a bit high to me.  agent_2:That seems like an optimistic number! I don't think I've ever read it. Now, if the library of Alexandria has a copy of the internet saved, does the internet have a copy of all the things in the library of Alexandria? agent_1:Interesting, the wayback machine might actually have that. agent_2:I'd forgotten about the wayback machine! I hope my old website hasn't been saved. Though it's nice to know that I could read it from atop Mt. Everest, if I had to. Can you imagine being up there and wanting to be on the internet? agent_1:I would never climb up there. I'm scared of heights. But that is interesting that there is 3g service up there.  agent_2:I wouldn't either. It's amazing how interconnected our lives are because of the internet.

12438	agent_1:What do you think of remakes of movies and cartoons? agent_2:I enjoy remakes if they are done well.  agent_1:I think Disney is planning to remake the Lion King.  Disney released the first trailer for next year for the Lion King remake. agent_2:That's correct. Disney is calling the new Lion King remake a live action film but it relies almost exclusively on CGI so a lot of people consider it annimation. agent_1:I do too. A related debate arose when Avatar was released, with the Visual Effects Society honoring James Cameron's 2009 epic for, among other trophies, animated character in a live-action feature motion picture agent_2:I agree that these kinds of films are skirting the line between traditional annimation and heavily CGI assisted live action films. With the improvements in the technology I'm not sure it makes sense anymore to feel the need to classify such films in the traditional modes. agent_1:Yeah I feel the same way of course Jon Favreau, the director of the Lion King remake has naturally walked down this valley before, with his update of The Jungle Book.  agent_2:Yes, the difference being that the Jungle Book still had a human character and therefore a true live action person was seen on screen. The Lion King contains no humans and so it is likely that everything is CGI. agent_1:Technology is all consuming. During the 70s, disney recycled a lot of their animation frames, resulting in identical scenes in some movies agent_2:That was a different time, generating those frames took so long that it made sense to recycle those that you could. Creation is a much quicker process now with the aid of computer programs. agent_1:Did you know that Frozen was the first animated Disney film directed by a woman. agent_2:Yes I had heard that. Disney does a good job trying to increase representation in their films and parks when possible. They also dubbed the Lion King into Zulu for its African release. agent_1:Makes sense i wasnt at all surprised when Disney acquired Marvel.  agent_2:I was. Disney has made some major moves lately but acquiring the much more adult properies of Marvel Studios was a bold move to me. agent_1:Yeah Bold but incredible lucrative. They certainly have their eye on the future.   agent_2:True. They will make a lot of money off the films but even more in merchandise. They are also adding a Marvel Land to Disneys California Adventure that will be a big money maker for them. agent_1:Yeah i considerate a smart but gutsy play as you said. On another note did you know that Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total agent_2:That's hard to imagine so many unknown species. I wonder where the estimate comes from. agent_1:Speaking of animals In 2002, germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights. agent_2:I think that is much needed. All countries should honor and respect animal rights. Scotland has declared the Loch Ness monster a protected species. agent_1:I agree i just hate it when animal lives some how trump human ones. nice talking to you agent_2:I'm not sure I've seen many situations where that occurs. It was nice talking to you as well.	agent_1:Last bit of info about animals is there are about 20 Quintilian individual animals on planet earth.	agent_2 likes animals. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['animals', 'movie', 'director'].
8909	agent_1:Hi, how are you on this fine evening? agent_2:hi I'm doing great how about you, did you know Julius Caesar would write fan fiction when he was young, It was about hercules haha agent_1:I'm with George RR Martin on this issue. Fan fiction sucks. it is copyright violation. Someone should sue Julius Caesar! agent_2:haha yes! Maybe hercules can prove he is real by suing! I guess Edgar allen poe has the title for oldest example of a cyborg in fiction agent_1:Hercules never understood copyright law! Poe wasn't perfect, but he knew sci fi. agent_2:haha I didn't know that, what did he do? agent_1:He married a gal that was like 13 or something. I guess in his day that was not unusual but still. Probably to an author and alcoholic these were normal things. agent_2:ah I see well that is definitely weird, what I'm not surprised with is there is a wikipedia that ranks fictinoal characters, it does it according to their abilities, I'll tell you some people have a lot of time on their hands agent_1:I think that some people live for such things! They get notoriety from such endeavors, but no money. Can you believe that in the 1950s a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic because it featured a black character? That's an amazing judgement. agent_2:that is pretty bad for sure, what I want to see is the violin made of stone that you can actually play, I play the piano do you play any instruments agent_1:I used to play the guitar, but I weren't any good. I would blow hard into it, but it never sounded quite right. Perhaps I should have tried the violin, but I mistook it for a form of violence. agent_2:haha I like that, ya my uncle plays the violin but he says its really hard to learn, the piano isn't that bad in my opinion, it has a good amount of challenge but I think anyone can get pretty good with enough practice	agent_1:I would like to think that I could be as good as Einstein.

I see their code of conduct state they are a DOG company.  agent_1:lol, I heard you can bring you dog to work while working there, kind of discriminating against cats though! agent_2:Kinda odd since dogs are normally louder and more likely to poop somewhere. Looks like Istanbul even has vending machines to release food and water for strays. agent_1:that is a great point! The US needs to get those vending machines, I would donate so many plastic bottles. That is nice of that country agent_2:I wonder where else the dogs go if not for vencing machines? agent_1:right, they probably go for trash cans unfortunately. Did you know dogs have 12 types of blood? agent_2:Makes sense for variety. Apparently they have doggie blood drives too! agent_1:that would be so awesome to volunteer at. I will have to look them up. Did you know dogs and elephants are the only animals that respond to pointing, sorry cats agent_2:My cats responding to pointing, and throwing. agent_1:That is true, so I wonder if there are more we don't know about lol. Do you like horses at all? agent_2:I took a horse ride once and live in an area with lots of horses. They are beautiful animals. you? agent_1:They are so beautiful, I like petting them but never rode one. I wouldn't ride Icelandic horses because they are super fast. agent_2:I wonder if riders trained horses to do that? agent_1:I am sure they did. I just wouldn't ride horses to school on no vehicle day and get suspended like two students did. I feel that was pointless agent_2:That's funny and rather stupid at the same time. agent_1:For sure lol, it was so nice talking with you, say hi to your cats for me!	agent_2:My cats will run away, but sure!	agent_1 likes pets. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['pets', 'hobby', 'dog blood drive'].

I do not play any more though. how often do you play? agent_2:I play in the summers we play a couple times a week, we play this game called pickleball a lot too its similar to tennis, did you hear that in 1969 they used helicopters to dry off the grass tennis courts, thats funny  agent_1:I had no idea. I am in parks and recreation and pickleball is a huge sport for us. At least compared to some other sports.  agent_2:ah nice have you ever played? its more action packed and easier than tennis I think agent_1:I have not but it does look fun. I am usually working when they are playing and would feel like too much of a slacker if I played instead of worked. agent_2:haha ya you have to work so thats fair, can you believe the longest tennis match ever lasted 11 hours spread over 3 days, I would be so tired agent_1:I think that was john isner, no? agent_2:oh I'm not sure, I would hate to be the loser of that match though? It does seem like you know a lot about tennis players agent_1:I watch way too much sports. If it is a big moment in sports, I know about it. I wish I watched less tv though but I love sports so much. agent_2:ya I agree, do you know the origin of the polo shirt? like who invented it and such? agent_1:I do not. Was it Ralph Lauren? agent_2:well it was created by a tennis player named Rene lacoste actually, and his nickname was the crocodile agent_1:I think I did know that, or at least now that you explain it to me it make sense. Lacoste is popluar attire for tennis. agent_2:ya you're right, do you know any soccer facts? thats one sport I never watch haha	agent_1:European soccer is on before college football and the nfl so I watch it on saturday and sunday mornings.

Mookie Betts seems to really be getting some distance on his hits.  agent_1:That's a new name to me, seems like a name from a Star Wars movie.  I wonder if they are the best team in baseball right now? agent_2:I really don't know.  They have a picture named Porcello that is really good.  It sounds like they have a good balance between pitching and hitting. agent_1:I'm originally from a different country but my wife is from Cleveland.  She used to get very excited in the late nineties when they had a good team.	agent_2:That's cool.  I guess FanGraphs estimates that the Red Sox have a 71% chance to win the division.

I know people like to know what they are wearing and stuff, but it seems trivial to me. agent_2:Very true, but no matter what they must conduct themselves with dignity, and their past all of a sudden becomes more in the public eye.  I never care who/what/where people wear.  Id rather see their actions. agent_1:The first lady is damned if they do and damned if they don't, get involved in policy that is. agent_2:It is sadly true.  Supposedly Melania wore a Jacket saying ""I dont care.  Do U"" to the boarder separated children agent_1:Probably not the best choice, but I'd hate it if every choice I made was monitored by hundreds of people every day. agent_2:Very true, It is hard to make any statement without a certain base of people hating on it. agent_1:The thing now that everyone has iphones and can take pictures of you every second of the day. agent_2:That does make things so much harder.

Now it can be at the store."	agent_1:The only place they can escape the constant media is in the White House, or any other private residence they may have.	agent_2 likes entertainment. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['entertainment', 'technology', 'smartphone'].
2117	agent_2:No I didn't know that either. I wonder if other animals can do that? Like can we Harvest Pig ribs for food and then they will regrow that way we don't have to kill the pig haha agent_1:That would be awesome! I'm sure science will figure that out someday! We can already use our current technology to date the extinction of ground sloths and determine where ancient human footprints led to. agent_2:That's really cool. I would love to see that. They should put that in the movie! I think it's cool that humans are adapted for persistence running. We are some of the best animals in the world at it agent_1:Haha yea that would be cool. That's really surprising humans are the best at persistence running! I wouldn't have guessed that. As long as those pesky hiccups don't attack while running! Darn evolution leftovers! agent_2:Haha yep hiccups are so annoying! So is that frequency that causes fear in humans ,have you heard about that LOL? agent_1:No, I had not. So fear comes from sound...? I thought it had to do with the autonomic nervous system, fight or flight thing? That would be really interesting to look into further.  agent_2:Can come from sound. And yes I'm going to look into that further as well. Do you like any animals by the way? agent_1:I used to own two cats, no current pets though. I would love to go to Japan and play with some cats at a cat cafe though! haha agent_2:Haha that does seem like a great idea! Get a drink and pet a cat LOL. Did you know that a cat will spend 10 years of its life sleeping when it's only 15 years old LOL that's a long time agent_1:That is nuts! What I wouldn't give to trade places! Or trade places with Stubbs, the cat who is the mayor of Talkeentna, Alaska! Sounds like a sweet gig.	agent_2:It does sound awesome!

Who's your favorite team? agent_1:I'm a Yankees fan, I never knew Babe Ruth was caught stealing home in the 1926 World Serires agent_2:It's surprising, you don't hear many bad things about Babe Ruth. I like the Dodgers therefore I am anti-yankee. agent_1:They had a great rivalry when both were in NY. It's crazy Babe Ruth would ever try to steal a base considering how big he was agent_2:I wonder how many stolen bases he had in his career. Maybe he thought he could just run the catcher over. agent_1:That would be an interesting fact to know. It's pretty crazy the Ottoman Empire was still around when the Cubs won back to back World Series agent_2:Yes the Cubs have suffered from the curse of the goat. agent_1:Who knew a man with a goat could wield such great power agent_2:Remind me not to make an enemy of anyone carrying a goat. I wonder if that's where the saying being a goat came from. Like Ruth was the goat after losing that game. agent_1:I don'tknow, maybe, Billy Sianis goat did stink agent_2:Probably so. Did you know the Cubs and Braves started playing the same year as the battle of the little bighorn? agent_1:That is pretty crazy, I wonder if any of the people from the Battle of Little Bighorn ever saw a Cubs game agent_2:I don't know. How do you feel about people today complaining about teams that are named after Native Americans, like the Braves? agent_1:Depends on how respectful it's done, the Braves don't have a bad logo but the Indians logo is pretty messed up	agent_2:The native americans don't seem to have a problem with it.

What does RBMG mean? agent_1:Taj Mahal is bigger than the white house. agent_2:Wow, I didn't know that, did you know the president's guest house is larger that the white house? What do you think about Robots? agent_1:i think president's guest house is small agent_2:I have lived in Washington DC and have never seen the guest house, but I was shock when I read upon it. Do you think it dangerous for men to built robots like human to go into dangerous places? agent_1:Definitely, it was very dangerous. agent_2:Did you know that Amazon ceo built a clock into the mountain that should run for 10,000 years? agent_1:Wow, it's wonderful. But i don't know. agent_2:Did you also know that the first Amazon.com first customer spent $27.95 got a building after him? that's something to think about. agent_1:I think the first customer was john wainwright. agent_2:Oh ok, did you know a single Google search required more computing power that It took to send Neil armstrong and eleven other astronauts to the moon?  agent_1:i don't know about it. agent_2:I don't either, do you used google alot?

Did you know he popularized many terms that we use to this day? agent_1:Yes terms like, good riddance, in my heart of heart and such agent_2:Yes. He lives at the same time as Pocahontas did agent_1:I wonder if they had met what he would have written about her. agent_2:Yeah good point. He also invented some women's names agent_1:Yes among those are Olivia, Miranda and Jessica agent_2:Yeah.

10243	"agent_1:Hi There! Do you like movies? agent_2:I like movies, it is a form of art. .  agent_1:This is interesting..Even though spartacus had a cinematographer, stanley kubrick took the camera away from him and did it himself.  agent_2:You have to do it yourself, he was very talented, I saw some of his films, but never Spartacus, is it good ?  agent_1:It is! But this is interesting too..even though he did almost none of the work, when spartacus got the academy award for best cinematography, it went to the credited cinematographer, and not kubrick. agent_2:Probably, some kind of union thing, like he was not an official cinematographer.  I wonder if they gave him something for it.  agent_1:Thats a good question! No woman has ever been nominated for the academy award for best cinematography. agent_2:I guess it is because there is not many female cinematographer because they would not hire them. Sexism still exist.  agent_1:That is terrible. A woman has never even been nominated. agent_2:Yeah, do you see movies made by a woman ? agent_1:I haven't paid attention to that. I'll have to now. Cinematographer roger deakins has been nominated 13 times for the best cinematography oscar, and has never won. agent_2:He was good but not enough, did he do any comedies ? I like those kind of film.  agent_1:I don't think he did. Do you like Bill murray? Bill murray thinks kung fu hustle is ""the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy"". agent_2:I like Bill Murray, Chinese comedies can be really funny. But I never saw kung fu hustle. Did you ? agent_1:no, not my type of movie! I do like Jack black though. The green lantern film was originally going to be a comedy starring jack black agent_2:That would have changed the tone of the movie, he is very slapstick.  agent_1:Some of his stuff is good, Some bad. Did you watch 3rd rock from the sun?  agent_2:I did when I was young, it was good but not memorable, not like Seinfeld.  agent_1:3rd rock from the sun won the golden globe for best comedy series in 1997, beating seinfeld, friends, and frasier. agent_2:That is surprising and not surprising at the same time, we don't know what will stand the test of time, disco was not forever.  agent_1:True! Wow! Comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows since its creation in 1989 agent_2:You have to try new thing and not be afraid to admit your mistakes. Comedy central would have been bankrupt if they continued to produce those 100 unfunny shows.  agent_1:True, I learned this the other day..The creator of the python programming language named it partly to honor british comedy group monty python agent_2:Do you like Monty Python ? I like absurd comedy, so I like them. agent_1:Not really, I never really understood it. agent_2:Don't worry I don't think I would find funny an ancient greek comedy.

I've had cockatiels, parakeets, and some fancier parrots when I was a kid. Did you know the famously extinct Dodo bird, is closely related to the pigeon? agent_2:That is awesome, so you are quite the bird expert.  I didn't know that, very interesting though.   agent_1:Haha! I know a few fun facts about birds. Such as in most birds the bones are so hollow that the feathers weigh more than the entire skeleton!  agent_2:That is awesome, I guess it makes sense though when you figure they have to be able to stay airborne.  agent_1:Apparently, humingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. I was always curious how they built such strong little nests! agent_2:That is so cool, I love learning about how different species in nature interact with each other to help themselves.  agent_1:Yeah, we are learning so much about so many things, these days! There are birds in Australia that can mimic the sound of car alarms, cameras and chain saws. I wonder if they are mockingbirds. agent_2:That is awesome, and yeah good one.  I wonder why they would mimic them as well? agent_1:It's interesting, but I also find it kind of sad that they mimic human made objects. Birds are amazing to me! Some birds fly from Alaska to Mexico, without sleeping when migrating!  agent_2:That is amazing for an animal to do that, sleeping is necessary, some animals sleep for crazy periods of time! agent_1:It would be pretty neat if we evolved wings from our forelimbs! Birds are called Aves sometimes, which makes sense since we call large bird houses, aviaries.	agent_2:That would be really wild, and I didn't know that, it does make sense though with the aviaries.

10577	"agent_1:lol, On april 18, 1930, the bbc decided there was no news worth reporting, so they broadcast piano music instead. Did You hear about that ? agent_2:No I didn't ...I'd bet it was more soothing that  the news agent_1:what do You mean, You don't like regular news ? ;) agent_2:Absolutely not. News is often depressing, and I could stand without it. Now, toss on a piano song, or music....now you've got me. Though I hate classical music. Well, most of it. agent_1:I wander if Brits were surprised when instead of news they got piano music instead ;) lol agent_2:They may have thought they won the lottery. I'm an older dude, but give me a nice pounding Elton John or Billy Joel rocker on piano, and I'm rockin' away! agent_1:Hey I'm with You, I mean I'm only 37 but yeah... I'll take ""Piano man"" instead of news any day ;) agent_2:It makes me happy when a younger guy like yourself, I'm 61, still could listen to a good piano song. Didn't realize people your age still know what musical instruments are? Well, not that you're that young. agent_1:hey ! :) I'm young inside ;) but yeah... I listen to all kind of rock, blues and metal... Pink Floyd, Joe Bonamassa, Dire Straits, Metallica, Nirvana... and many more ;) agent_2:Nice! I used to be a DJ in clubs back in the day....remembered playing a ton of that stuff. Been to a lot of concerts? agent_1:Oh yes, I think I've beat my record last year... I saw Nick Cave twice, I won tickets to see Metallica, and I saw King Crimson for the first time. Oh, and I saw Joe Bonamassa too ;) agent_2:You got to see some good ones, that's for sure. I stopped going to concerts years ago!, but man....back in the 70's, seeing Pink Floyd, Bachman Turner Overdrive, Heart and Electric Light Orchestra on the same bill was fantastic....and it was only $15.00 a ticket. agent_1:Holy Crap ! ;) Now to see phil collins it's like $350 and those are not even good seats... ;) times changed, that's for sure... agent_2:Yep. I wish the Factual Section 3 was Rock Music instead of Classical. The only story I have on classical music, is that I was a limo driver for an Arab shiek back in 2001. He bought me a 10 disco best of Classical artists box sex. Wasn't bad, but only listened to it once or twice. That's all I got on Classical music. agent_1:I'm not too close to classical music, but I did like the soundtrack to Space Odyssey 2001 - it's as close to classical I got ;) agent_2:LOL....I hear ya. Oh, and sorry for the spelling, it was ""10 Disc"" and ""box set"" I meant.

I'm wondering is it only Japan, but any Asian country as well.  agent_1:Interesting, do you know if they play a championship game there? And if so, what is it called?>  agent_2:I have no idea. But if so, why US teams don't play aganst Japanese? lol It could the World Cup like in soccer/footaball every January 4 teams from different continents play  agent_1:I don't know, curious why we call it a world series but the two countries never play each other.  agent_2:Absolutely.

Neat that he was a ballet dancer.  Speaking of ballet dancers, I'm told they go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a WEEK.  Talk about being on your toes! agent_1:They sure do! Michael Jackson had specially made shoes for some of his own dance moves. agent_2:Wonder if that how he was able to do that ""extreme lean"" move he does.  (I'm told he owns a patent on the device, but dunno if the device is shoes or something else...)  Did you know Bruce Lee was also a great dancer? agent_1:He won the Hong Kong Cha-Cha in 1958. my kids do the cha cha slide in Call of Duty. agent_2:Hehe. That's funny.  Speaking of kids, they say even babies spontaneously dance when they hear music.  I saw a youtube video once of a baby jamming out to Gangnum Style by Psy.  LOL agent_1:That is cute when they do that. I didn't know that moon dust is so sharp, it can cut through kevlar. agent_2:Not just that, but they say it can give you ""Moon Hay Fever"".  Had no idea there was moon hay fever... that just sounds both scary and nutty...  agent_1:Yeah, it does. I can't believe NASA thought about placing a UN flag on the moon, instead of the American flag. agent_2:Ahhh... forget that!  As far as I know, the UN didn't help the US get to the moon.  Grrr... don't get started on the subject of the UN, trying to watch my blood pressure!  :)  Speaking of moons, did you know Phobos (Mars' moon) is one third hollow?   agent_1:I've always wondered how they know things like this. Especially when you think that they once thought it was hollow. agent_2:That I can't tell ya.. it's just amazing all the stuff they've been able to discover just by telescopes and pictures.  Heck, they believe there's evidence of methane based life on Satan's moon, Titan.  That'd be pretty amazing if they can confirm it! agent_1:If they were smart, they would stay hidden. Oddly, an aluminum grand piano was built for the Hindenburg. I wonder how it sounded? agent_2:That's a good question, dunno if making it out of aluminum would make it sound different or not.  Like with violins.  There's a noticeable difference in sound with them depending on the type of wood used... agent_1:I don't know much about them, as neither of my kids play piano. It's interesting that Freddie Mercury and Paul McCartney used the same piano to record songs on agent_2:That'd probably make it one of the most valuable piano's ever (if it was up for sale, that is.)  Speaking of piano, did you know there's a song designed for stress testing auto-pianos?  It's called Circus Galop.  You can hear it on Youtube if you're interested... agent_1:I did not. I wonder how a piano got to the top of Britains highest mountain? agent_2:My guess?  Pranksters!  LOL.  I mean, seriously, who looks at a huge mountain, and says, ""Hey, lets get a piano up there!""

You earn points for doing searches but they have a limit on the amount you can earn each day.  Did you know that google was created over 20 years ago already in 1998? agent_2:Yes. Wish I'd invested in Google stock when they made 2004 public offering! agent_1:Oh yeah!  A single google search requires more computing power than it took to send men to the moon! agent_2:Right. Mind-boggling, but shows advancements in tech. svcs. and products, doesn't it? agent_1:Yes!  Google maps calculates traffic by tracking how fast android devices are moving on the road.  That's pretty mind boggling too.  So they are pretty much tracking cell phones and using some of the data for that.  Interesting. agent_2:Well said. Did you know that if you wanted, say, to find a location in the disputed region of Kashmir, Google would show you only the map of the claims of the country (India or Pakistan) where the browser you're using is located? agent_1:I didn't know that before but now I do!  Thanks!  Do you remember when Google went down for about 5 minutes on Aug. 16th 2013 and took 40 percent of the web traffic with it?  I don't remember it. agent_2:Me, either, but I do know that internet companies like Google, or Amazon, use tech that is often beyond my comprehension...Do you suppose that's the point, really? agent_1:It might be.  I'm a big Amazon customer.  Are you? agent_2:In the past few years, have ordered books and supplies from Amazon, yes. They have - almost anything, don't they? agent_1:Yes.  I have Prime and we got rid of the cable because the video streaming service for Prime is worth the price of Prime every year. agent_2:Heard that streaming is great, and that Amazon is producing original fillms and TV shows. My fav. is The Grand Tour. agent_1:My kids like the Grand Tour.  Amazon now will even deliver your packages on Sundays because they have a contract with the US post office for the delivery service. agent_2:Convenient, too. If we lived in China, the giant e-commerce co. would be Alibaba. Did you know its founder was turned down by Harvard & Yale as an under-grad. student? Think they're sorry, now?	agent_1:I didn't know that!  I bet they are.

Did you know that women are more likely than men to have an iPhone? I wonder why. agent_2:Im not sure, they probably werent the ones downloading that game send me to heaven and launching them into the air. agent_1:Ha ha maybe. Have you heard of the band Muse? agent_2:Cant say that I have, what do they do? agent_1:Kind of pop rock. Matt Bellamy of Muse recorded his unborn son's heartbeat with his iPhone and used it on a song recording.  agent_2:That is pretty neat.  It is certainly a huge part of our society today, I am glad it has developed from the first versions where Jobs had to switch it out because it kept crashing. agent_1:That's so embarrassing. I hope he pulled it off. Microsoft held an iPhone funeral when they released their phones. That was presumptuous.   agent_2:Very much so, I bet apple just laughed.  Apple's electronics are far superior, in my opinion.  Their clothing line from 1986, likely not. agent_1:Wow! I don't remember that venture. That was a bad idea. Speaking of clothing, did you know that the pilgrims were colorful clothing? agent_2:I had heard that, but I guess i just remember the white and black from all the history books, or rather the illustrations and descriptions.   agent_1:They always depicted it that way but they only wore black for special occasions.  agent_2:I wonder why they always were depicted like that, I mean color is so much more fun. agent_1:That's a very good question. There is a store in Alabama that only sells clothing and items found in unclaimed baggage. 	agent_2:It must be like a high end thrift shop.

In fact I'm wearing some right now LOL what about you agent_1:I know a decent amount although I do not care the most about fashion. Did you know that Apple had a clothing line back in 1986? agent_2:No I didn't know that. I wonder what those clothes look like? They're probably very colorful like the pilgrims original clothes, not the black clothes that they wore for special occasions agent_1:I wonder what apples clothing line looked like too. And speaking of Pilgrims, I thought that it was the exact opposite as what you said. I guess it is just me. agent_2:A lot of things are the opposite of what you would think. Like how ripcurl says on their clothes that they are made in China when in fact they are made in North Korea agent_1:I am not suprised that they tried to keep that a secret. I do not think anyone would buy something that was made in North Korea! agent_2:Nope I definitely would not! I also wouldn't buy clothes from unclaimed baggage, there's a store in Alabama that actually sells that stuff agent_1:Really? I would not trust that store. Professional Ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week! agent_2:That is impressive! How often do you wear shoes by the way? I want to try on the shoes that are 5000 years old and actually perform better than current shoes agent_1:I am sure that those shoes are also much, much more expensive to manufacture although trying them on would be a pretty neat experience agent_2:They probably smell bad because they're so old, we should put dry tea bags inside of them because that will absorb the odor LOL agent_1:I do not think that is the best idea..... It would probably damage the shoes. Maybe spraying it with bottle of febreeze would be better... agent_2:Speaking of clothes, what do you think about shirts? Did you know that you can wear a necktie under the collar with a dress shirt? I do that for work agent_1:I occasionally do that. The pallbearers wore blue shirts and khaki pants to billy mays funeral. Disrespectful much? agent_2:Haha that is either very disrespectful or very respectful LOL. I wish I lived in Hawaii though, you can wear an Aloha shirt instead of a suit and tie there agent_1:That is probably because it is much warmer there. Nevertheless, I also wish that I could show up to work in a random t-shirt! agent_2:Yep I agree with you! I think it's cool that the polo shirt was not invented by a polo player, but was actually invented by a tennis player, very interesting	agent_1:I wonder why it was called the polo shirt then, shouldn't it be called the 'tennis shirt'? Although that does sound quite weird	agent_2 likes wear. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['wear', 'Apple', 'fashion'].
3381	agent_1:Hey, you a fan of any sports involving hitting balls with sticks? agent_2:Many such games fit that description.   Golf is one I enjoy. agent_1:I like golf a lot. It's a real shame how much water is wasted per day on each course, though. It's over 300,000 gallons a day a course! agent_2:True, but consider that golf courses in America combined are larger than the size of two small US states! agent_1:Yeah, golf must be pretty popular in that case. Did you know there exists a golf course in Dubai that uses around 4 million gallons a day? That must cost a lot of money. agent_2:I suppose that comes with games that cannot and do not utilize a standardized playing area agent_1:You know what games do utilize a standardized playing area? Baseball and softball. The fields are pretty similar. agent_2:Interesting.    Babe Ruth was both a famous golfer and baseball player! agent_1:Speaking of famous people who play sports, Samuel L. Jackson actually plays golf twice a week during filming of whatever he's in. agent_2:Cool.    Did you know Jose canseco claims to hold the record for longest softball homerun at 622 feet agent_1:Woah, that's really far! Softball players don't make a lot of money. It's usually between $5,000 and $6,000. agent_2:Well, what do you expect with a game invented at the YMCA? agent_1:Softball may have been invented at the YMCA, but it's pretty much a lesser baseball, which is America's national pastime.  agent_2:Someone asked me about points in baseball, and I had to explain they are runs! agent_1:Yeah, golf uses points called strokes though. Unlike baseball, less is more in golf. agent_2:Funny how things get named - like golf uses clubs, but baseball uses a bat. agent_1:Softball uses a bat as well. agent_2:True.    I wonder if they called it that when they used an actual soft ball. agent_1:I wonder if the fact that the game used to use a soft ball but now uses a hard ball has any influence on the records.	agent_2:It probably does, although more important is that softball started as an indoor sport.	agent_1 likes sports. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'hobby', 'golf'].

Have you been to many concerts? agent_2:i used to go to concerts when i was younger. dont have the time or money now. LOL You? agent_1:Haha same here!

8473	agent_1:Hi, how are you? agent_2:I am good. How are you?  Do you like baseball?  Have you ever heard of their unwritten rules such as if you hit one of our we'll hit one of yours? agent_1:Well, Yes and yes. I do not like the unwritten rules. Seems too unfun... Do you like them? agent_2:Some of them seem more like common sense to me.  I mean, not bringing a pet to the batting cage for one makes sense. agent_1:That one does make sense. Mine are more like, pimp your HR trot. Go ahead. Ill be better next time... agent_2:I like the unwritten rule of don't eat baked beans before a double header and don't order out for sushi during a rain delay. agent_1:I understand the baked beans, that's common courtesy... But what's wrong with sushi? agent_2:I don't know, maybe they think the guy will get sick or something.  The players do do some running to bases and maybe they think that'll slow them down. agent_1:Makes sense. I do hate the rule about stealing when you are down or trying a bunt when you are getting no-hit. agent_2:What does the rule say about those?	agent_1:Don't do those things. If you are down big, you shouldn't steal. If you have not gotten a hit, you shouldn't bunt.	agent_2 dislikes baseball. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['baseball', 'work', 'work'].

6523	agent_1:When I previously thought of virtual reality I thought of gaming, but have you heard about its uses in the educational revolution? agent_2:Hello there, same here, no I haven't seen too much about the educational side though.  agent_1:Through virtual reality, children will be able to attend virtual schools and learn how they want. Through their tablets or visually. agent_2:That is really cool, I guess they can get access to things and places that they never would have been able to before.  agent_1:Yes, for example if they want to learn visually they can use the headsets to travel to ancient Egypt and watch the pyramids get built! agent_2:Wow, that is even cool for me and i'm an adult!   agent_1:It is.  It is becoming a lot more affordable too.  It used to be over $1000, but in two or three years should be less than $100. agent_2:I think you are right, I think more schools will have these in the coming years as well.  agent_1:Yes, and can even use them at home to educate.  The program will allow the parents to keep tabs on their children to see how they are doing. agent_2:And I think all of those safety features for parents are a must with all technology these days! agent_1:Yes, safety and affordability.  With a lot of companies like Google, Lenovo, Magic Leap, and Facebook involved you know there will be an affordable and great product. agent_2:Yeah and I think there will be profitable business there as well so its win win for those companies as well.  agent_1:Yes, agreed.  You even have a company like Lockheed Martin that can take kids on a virtual reality tour of Mars! agent_2:Wow, now wouldn't that be something.  I wonder if they will be able to do that with planets further out in the future? agent_1:With all of those companies and a company like Facebook worth over $100 billion I am sure they sky the is the limit. agent_2:Exactly.  Do you use Facebook much? agent_1:I do.  I cannot believe in 2005 that Myspace turned down an offer to buy Facebook for $75 million! agent_2:Right! That would have been one of those deals of a lifetime, but mistakes happen.  agent_1:It is impressive how huge it has become.  In fact, Iceland is literally rewriting their constitution using Facebook.  They allow the public to chime in with suggestions! Wild! agent_2:Yeah I saw that, very interesting.  But, it makes sense though, let the people help control how the government operates, not the other way around.

10111	agent_1:Hello how are you today? agent_2:Hello, I am good. How are you?  Do you listen to jazz music? agent_1:I like all music. Did you know jazz originated in the African American communities of New Orleans in the late 19th and early 20 century. agent_2:i think I did know that.  Seems like I've seen a movie that referenced it.  Didn't they combine jazz with some brass band marches or something? agent_1:It has roots in blues and ragtime.  It is now recognized as a major form of musical expression. agent_2:I'm glad.  It's world wide now too.  Pakistan has a jazz orchestra! agent_1:Cool jazz actually originated in the 1940s. It introduced calmer smoother sounds and long linear melodic lines you hear in todays jazz. agent_2:i like that. There's a lot of good music from the 40s. agent_1:Were you aware that Clint Eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast. agent_2:No I wasn't.  i guess going by the characters he plays in movies I just never made the connection. agent_1:Oh he is a big fan. He even scored several films including million dollar baby. That is a great movie. agent_2:He did?  What instrument does he play? agent_1:I think he played a few different instruments. There is a woman in Harlem who has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every Sunday or over 20 years. agent_2:That's cool. I bet she's pretty good to last that long. agent_1:She occasionally has top performers stop by. I wonder if Clint has ever checked it out. agent_2:You never know.  He's a top performer if he can do a movie score.   agent_1:I just figured it would be something that would interest him. Did you know jazz trumpeters grow out their goatees because it provides comfort while playing their instrument. agent_2:No lol! I just assumed it was for fashion. agent_1:So what do you think about Judge Judy making 123000 dollars per episode. I heard she retired not to long ago. agent_2:That surprises me. I mean, i'm shocked she made so much money and that she retired.	agent_1:She was the highest paid celebrity behind Lebron James.

9286	agent_1:Good morning. Do you follow politics? agent_2:Good morning, I'd say I follow some politics, but not too deeply. agent_1:Were you aware that the taller candidate usually wins in the election. since 1900 it has happened 75 percent of the time. agent_2:Is that so, maybe I should enter politics, I'm over six feet, I could have missed my calling. agent_1:Maybe so. Lol. Did you know that nevada is the only state to have a none of these candidates option while voting?  agent_2:I guess it's nice to have that option, especially if you have one one your really don't want to vote for, for example, someone who doesn't exactly agree with history textbooks. agent_1:On a funnier note. President truman in 1957 refused to have his picture taken with dumbo because he didnt want to be associated with republicans. Lol. agent_2:Media savvy in the days before camera phone and the internet, I would categorize him as forward thinking. agent_1:H sure was. Did you know that the use of red and blue for the two major parties was not used until the year 2000. Crazy huh? agent_2:That is the kind of thing you think has been around for ever.  Maybe that is why we only have two major parties, everyone's two favorites colors are taken. agent_1:I think they should just change all of their colors to brown. During the 2012 elections international electoral observrs were blocked from the polls in nine states. agent_2:That would make me suspicious of what is going on there, why don't they want to be observed?  These are the places that end up with animals becoming mayor, or cats placing high on Senate elections. agent_1:I would say a cat would be better than some of the politicians. So have you ever played fantasy congress? agent_2:Fantasy congress sound like it is taking the whole fantasy sports thing to far.  I can't see many people sitting in bars yelling at CSPAN because their politician has made the wrong move. agent_1:No janet you were supposed to be against abortion. Lol. I v could see it as well. Sorry about that last message. I dont know what happened there. Did you know that the first woman was elected to congress in 1916. agent_2:Woman are becoming more represented, may one day the Presidential job can be their, whether she is red or blue. agent_1:I just dont understand why women couldnt vote but could be elected to congress.	agent_2:Maybe it was an oversight of the rule writers, a loop hole so to speak.

5166	agent_1:Do you follow baseball? agent_2:Yes. I am a dodger fan agent_1:Awesome!  I like Walker Buehler.  What do you think of the Dodgers/Reds trade?  Think it was a good one?   agent_2:No. They gave up too much. Puig was a pain in the neck, but one of the best defensive left fielders in baseball. The pitcher wood was a young guy who was an all star 2 years ago agent_1:I was kind of surprised when they did that trade.  Did you know baseball managers wear uniforms because they can technically play if needed? agent_2:Yes. I remember Pete Rose and Frank Robinson doing that agent_1:Yes.  How about the guy who found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards that were hidden in his grandfathers attic since the 1940s.  I'm not ashamed to admit that I still a few packs of baseball cards every year.  It gives me the thrill I had when I was kid opening them. agent_2:Yes my base baseball cards were thrown out many many years ago. I wish I had those back agent_1:They were super huge there in the late 80s and early 90s but have died down in popularity since then.  Did you know kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada? agent_2:Yes. I had heard that before. agent_1:I don't know if I would like to schedule the games.  For 24 years a married couple scheduled all MLB games played each year. agent_2:That sounds like a heck of a big job. agent_1:I would want no part of it.  Babe Ruth was thrown out stealing to end game 7 and lose the 1926 world series.  First time I've ever seen that fact. agent_2:I have never heard that before.  agent_1:First time for me as well.

Maybe one of us will win soon, it hasn't happened since 1853. agent_2:Well I am just hoping Trump doesn't win a second term next year, but with how corrupt everything is now it is looking like a very likely outcome. agent_1:I do too, I don't particularly like him. Did you vote last election agent_2:I did, I voted Hillary even though I didn't really care for her either, but she was a much better choice than what we ended up with. agent_1:For sure, I voted third party. I was part of the problem, I wanted a 3rd party to win because it has been years! agent_2:Well Bernie Sanders just announced his 2020 run, so if he actually makes it onto the ballot this year I will vote for him. agent_1:Yea, he got taken out of the running in 2016 by hillary. I am voting BIDEN! agent_2:If Biden decided to run in 2020 i would probably choose him over Bernie, I always liked him when he was VP. agent_1:For sure, and he would take Trump down. agent_2:I am not sure anyone can take Trump down at this point, with all the rumored election rigging and ties to Russia, I personally think he will just cheat to win again and no one will do anything about it, just like these last 4 years.	agent_1:Right, I figured the same thing!

We gotta start looking for some tall people to run in 2020 agent_2:lol, Using the lottery to appoint leaders is scary like they did in ancient Athens!  agent_1:Very true.  I wouldnt just want any random politician in charge. agent_2:True, They thought it would lead to oligarchy. agent_1:It could have.  I think we need what Nevada has, a none of these candidates option on the ballot. agent_2:I was thinking the same thing! Why are they the only state? All states should have that. agent_1:It would really let the government know what the people are thinking. agent_2:I agree, I'm surprised its only republican presidents that have had beards! agent_1:Yeah, there havent been that many at that either. agent_2:Two, lol Its funny they have a candy desk at the senate filled with chocolate bars and jellybeans! agent_1:Id be claiming that as my desk!  I heard all the candy is made in PA agent_2:Yes, I bet it helps keep their sugar levels up while making important decisions.  agent_1:When the actually do that.  It seems like they are always out and rarely in session agent_2:lol, yes. I'm surprised it wasn't until 1993 that women could wear pants on the senate floor! 	agent_1:I know.

Heard of him? agent_1:Yeah I have heard of him, he has made some good songs.  Do you know what age he graduated high school?	agent_2:They say age 25. I'm guessing that he may have received a GED.  He's been in show business, first, a TV series called Degrassi: The Next Generation, ever since Drake was a 14 year old.

10284	"agent_1:I just read a section on comedy which states that the python program was partly named after Monty Python. I love how they did that! agent_2:Yeah the programming language I think is what you mean. Classic comedy. Kung Fu Hustle is a brilliant comedy also. agent_1:I've actually never seen it, whats it about?  agent_2:It's a wacky cartoony slapstick comedy. Bill Murray loves the movie too. agent_1:i'll add it to my list of movies to watch. Bill Murray is such a great comedian, unfortunately I don't think he's been in movies as of late. Green lantern is on my list of movies to watch too, weird to think that it was initially going to be a comedy agent_2:Yeah I think Jack Black was supposed to star. Hard to believe that 3rd Rock beat Seinfeld for best comedy in '97 at the golden globes agent_1:I've actually never even seen an episode of 3rd rock. Seinfeld was revolutionary, are you more of a Seinfeld or Friends fan? agent_2:Seinfeld by far. Friends doesn't hold up very well for me. I wonder if it would have been one of the 100 shows Comedy Central cancelled over the years if it had been on that channel. You? Friends or Seinfeld? agent_1:perhaps! I'm actually more of a Friends fan myself lol. It's interesting how much tv shows and movies have changed over the years. Even just through more advanced filming abilities and styles. Shout out to James Wong for pioneering the use of wide-angle lenses amongst other things agent_2:He was quite the pioneer despite the racism. agent_1:he had a lot to overcome and still won an Oscar. I've read in other articles that the Oscars are pretty racist too, not recognizing talented individuals due to their race.  agent_2:There are definitely some problems. A woman has never won best cinematographer, or even been nominated. agent_1:that's some crazy stuff. It even must be frustrating with Roger Daekins for being nominated 13 times and never having won agent_2:And the guy who was supposed to be the cinematographer for Spartacus didn't actually do the work and won the academy award. agent_1:I'd be pretty angry if that happened to me lol. Have you heard of Gavin Free before reading about him? agent_2:Yeah he did slo-mo cinematography on Hot Fuzz. agent_1:interesting, Hot Fuzz was a good movie. I thoroughly enjoy comedies agent_2:Yeah it was. Comedy is a great art form. It all started back in ancient Athens. agent_1:Its interesting how the change of definition of ""planet"" meant that Pluto was no longer a planet.  agent_2:I'm still bitter about that.

It's crazy that baseball managers can actually join in the game, that's why they wear uniforms agent_2:Yes, if they need to play for their teams, I dont know why that would happen, but it might be fun to watch! agent_1:Yeah that could be cool. It's also cool that a man found millions of dollars worth of old baseball cards in his attic haha his grandfather and put them there and I guess forgotten about them? agent_2:Maybe, I should start checking my attic and see what treasures are stored up there.  I might have an early retirement.   agent_1:Haha yes I hope so! You know what is weird though? Have you ever played the game kickball, apparently it's called soccer-baseball in Canada for some reason agent_2:I guess it is a pretty accurate name too, however I much prefer kickball. agent_1:Uranium kickball sounds a lot better haha. What do you think about the Japanese? Apparently they are shocked to learn that baseball is actually America's pastime and was not invented in Japan agent_2:It is surprising, I bet they wonder why they are not invited to the world series either. agent_1:Haha yes I bet! I think it's interesting that the Women's World Cup higher television ratings than the World Series. I don't like soccer myself.	agent_2:I would actually say I am a bigger soccer fan than Baseball.

And with all that technology, Google built their first computer with the housing being made out of legos. agent_1:Computers can be made of anything. Russians made a computer that ran on water and someone built a working 16bit computer using nothing but basic minecraft building blocks! agent_2:Yep... and Disney definitely takes advantage of the computer making CGI movies agent_1:Indeed. Hollywood too have been remaking beloved classics with new CGI technology and overall better technology thanks to computers agent_2:and we definitely benefit from it all as consumers! agent_1:I am looking forward to the disney lion king's remake of the 1994 classic agent_2:yeah me too... but i am classic kind of person though!  should be interesting seeing it done in cgi though! agent_1:What do you think of live action remakes?	agent_2:They are ok... like i said... much prefer the old school classics!	agent_1 likes music. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'movie', 'movie company'].

It seems like he has been around forever. agent_1:Yeah he's been around for a while, he's actually going to perform at the Capital One Arena very soon. His newest album is called man of the Woods by the way agent_2:Wasn't is previous album FutureSex/LoveSounds in 2006?  What is the reason for the long dry spell? agent_1:Yeah I don't know. I think he just needed some time to get his bearings. I guess a lot of people think that his songs feel empty in this new release though agent_2:Thinking back, about the only thing I remember about Justin Timberlake is NippleGate in the 2004 Super Bowl.  From what I read, in the interim has broken into acting, gotten married and became a father.  Do people think his songs are ""empty"" because he has changed his style or do they think he has lost his musical bearing?  His major life changes may have changed his musical perspective. agent_1:Yes I think is you could alter your taste in music will change. What do you think about albums though? Who made your favorite album  agent_2:Pink Floyd ""The Wall"" is my favorite.  Did you know ""The Dark Side of the Moon"" is still one of the best selling albums after 40 years!  And yours? agent_1:Wow that's great! I also love Pink Floyd and I love Metallica, I know that my friend loves Linkin Park and they have a best selling album right now agent_2:I did not know that.  What I find interesting is the resurgence in vinyl LPs for audiophiles.  Most of my music is digital, except for some local Louisiana bands who never made it big.  I still have their vinyl albums and play them every now and then.  What do you think of NWA's Straight Outta Compton? agent_1:I think it's a great album! It's crazy that it went platinum without getting any AirPlay or without them doing a tour agent_2:Do you think that the movie by the same name had anything to do with it going platinum?"	agent_1:Yes I think it went platinum before the movie came out haha.

Are you Clint Eastwood? LOL. I've never ridden a horse, but they seem like majestic animals. agent_2:I wish I were Clint Eastwood! But I never knew that Iceland actually has a specific horses with a fifth speed, other horses do not have this ability for some reason agent_1:I don't understand the speeds. Trot, gallop, ??? What else is there? agent_2:yes its something called Tolt, I don't know exactly how fast that is though lol agent_1:I guess they have used horses there for many purposes. What do you think of the two high school students who rode their horses to school on 'no vehicles to school day', and got suspended? agent_2:I think that was genius but pretty dumb that they got suspended haha. What do you think about Dalmatians? Do you know how they are related to horses agent_1:I know that they are used by firefighters. I heard that they were deaf or something. agent_2:Yes a lot of them are actually deaf. What do you think about Elon Musk by the way? I know that's a change of topic haha agent_1:That is a change of topic. He is not a dalmatian, or a horse, or deaf. I think that he is ambitious and trying to create new technology. You? agent_2:Yes he seems very smart and also very ambitious. I think he has a dog but it's not a Dalmatian though haha. His wife also appeared in the movie Inception by the way agent_1:I thought he got divorced? Is he still married? She must be pretty. agent_2:I think he is still married. I'm not sure what she looks like though, did you ever watch the movie thank you for smoking by the way? agent_1:Yes, I did. A long time ago. An interesting film. I like Aaron whatshisname.  agent_2:Yes I did like that movie, Elon Musk apparently produced it and I forgot that he acted in it too agent_1:I'll have to check for that.

Furthermore, they have highly mobile jaws and usually fangs for venom. agent_1:That's true. My husband pulled one out of my garden. I had never seen it before. It's a rat snake. I guess they are good for killing pests. agent_2:I think rat snakes aren't poisonous? Did you know that the fear of snakes are wired into human brains? I guess people who hate snakes should live in new Zealand since there aren't any there. agent_1:Nope, rat snakes aren't poisonous. They are actually a good kind. I have always believed no snakes should exist, so I believe we are wired for it! agent_2:I wonder what differentiates snakes from legless lizards? agent_1:That is a good question. Maybe that lizards have eyelids and some snakes dont.  agent_2:That makes sense. Personally, I don't mind snakes, although I am wary since venom can be quite potent and dangerous. As long as they aren't flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey are around my area and I can spot them well a head of time, I'm okay.	agent_1:flying snakes? My worst nightmare!!	agent_2 likes animals. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['animals', 'pets', 'reptiles'].
6541	"agent_1:Hi!  Are you a facebook user? agent_2:Yes, I do use it, but mostly for the games app's social part. I'd rather play a game. I've heard the Virtual Reality video games are pretty cool. Would you try? agent_1:I think I would try it to see what it was like. agent_2:I've seen lots of examples on Facebook of people playing a VR game and getting terrified or surprised. It looks like a lot of fun! agent_1:I wonder how much the headsets cost for it?  The fist virtual reality game was made in 1968.  I had no idea they were around then. agent_2:I thought I've heard that VR has been used for training soldiers, so I wonder if it could have been around for even longer than 1968, but kept secret! agent_1:Quite possible.  I read where 40 percent of users experience motion sickness in virtual reality. agent_2:Well, that part doesn't sound very fun. Did you know there is a NASA scientist who genuinely believes we're living in a reality generated by a computer? Or maybe multiple computers... agent_1:I didn't know that.  I know that Lockheed Martin has a virtual reality ""Mars bus"" that can take kids on a tour of Mars.  That would be neat. agent_2:Wow, I was excited when I heard a company was starting art buses to park in lots of shopping centers to look after kids while parents shop. I can't even imagine how great a VR Mars tour bus would be!!! agent_1:Hahaha  Do you know anyone that has the Oculus Rift VR headset that Facebook released? agent_2:I don't, but I'd love to try it. I am really interested in those augmented reality systems that area a type of VR. I had an idea for those Google glasses before they came out, even! agent_1:Nice!  Stanford's free artificial intelligence class uses Google plus hangouts to help them teach more effectively.  What do you think of AI?  It kind of scares me. lol agent_2:Meant to say augmented reality. I think it's strange how Tesler's Theorem for AI is whatever hasn't been done yet. Does that mean he wouldn't call the VR games AI? agent_1:I have no idea.  Good question.  AI has crushed all human records in the puzzle game ""2048"".  I haven't heard of that game. agent_2:I haven't heard of that game, either. There's a game I play where you get better by doing daily tasks. I should make an AI device to do it for me! agent_1:lol Nice!  Did you hear about the promotion that Burger King ran where if you were to unfriend 10 people on Facebook they would give you a free whopper?  I would have taken them up on that."	agent_2:I think there were probably people catching on and adding 10 random people just to unfriend, though!

5897	agent_1:Hi, how are you? agent_2:Good, how are you? Celebrities in science are quite rare aren't they? I was a fan of Stephen Hawking. I'm sad he finally passed away from ALS. agent_1:He was tremendous thinker. Gosh, I wonder if he was as smart as Kim Jong-un, who has a degree in physics, supposedly.  agent_2:I would think that he is smarter. I wonder how it felt to have such a physical disability but yet such a sharp mind. agent_1:In his younger years, he wasn't badly afflicted. I wonder whether he was one of the  scientists who theorize that universes evolve through natural selection agent_2:Hmm, it wouldn't surprise me. Hawking went further than Einstein did on understanding of gravity. Hawking developed new graphical methods that let him visualize physics of light paths in warped space, black holes, and the convulsions of the universe. agent_1:And he did all that while battling ALS. There is a theory that there is only one electron in the universe. Does this make any sense? I wonder who came up with that. agent_2:Hmm, it does not to me but I know I'm not much of a scientific mind. Hawking strengthened the Big Bang theory as well that says that the galaxies were in a compressed area smaller than a single atom before the big bang. agent_1:Hard to imagine, but I guess the mathematics supports it. The universe could have come from nothing without violating physics. Particles can pop in and out of existence, so I guess a universe worth could as well. agent_2:Yeah, it's hard for me to relate to scientists and all of their elaborate theories but Hawking was blessed with wit. He was quite the jokester, which makes him very relatable. agent_1:I think he took to his celebrity status quite well. Pixar studio has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities. I wonder if Hawking ever got a chance to see it. agent_2:Speaking of celebrities, did you know that Judge Judy is the highest paid celebrity after lebron james? agent_1:The woman is a legend. Over $100k per episode. Probably a longer career too. But she probably hasn't done any animated voice work. agent_2:I guess celebrities doing voice work is a fairly new thing in terms of history. Robin Williams was the first to start the trend of celebrities doing animated film voices. This was for the movie Aladdin. agent_1:Did he ever appear on Sesame Street? Carol Burnett was the first celebrity to appear on the children's series. He would have been great on that show! agent_2:That is a good question! Do you like celebrity chefs? agent_1:Not especially. I think it's more about them than the food. You?	agent_2:Yeah, not really. It's cool that a celebrity chef from Ethiopia is using his fame for good. He believes he can combat his country's hunger problems	agent_1 likes food. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['food', 'science', 'famous scientist'].
5448	agent_1:The Braves sure are a pupular team, they seem to be well rested for the playoffs agent_2:Is that good or bad.  They have had no real good teams to play against. agent_1:I think its a bad thing, practice is everything and not playing enough games can result in lack of chemistry agent_2:Thursday at 8:07 am eastern time, the Braves play their first playoff game since 2013.  Many new players going to playoffs for first time. agent_1:They have many young players so its going to be a great experience for them hope that they can make it agent_2:As long as they do not forget that runners advance counter clock wise around four bases to score a run, they will be fine. agent_1:Yeah I think they have a great team so as long as they remember the rules everything is going to be ok, the manager can always step in and play with them agent_2:I guess thats why the manager dresses like a player.  Is there really a rule that catching a ball in a players hat gives the other team three bases? agent_1:I dont know I haven't seen that, then again I dont watch many of the games, baseball is really popular in Japan so maybe they know if its true over there agent_2:Baseball came from Japan.  Makes sense.  The pitcher throws a ball which the opposing team tries to hit with a bat.	agent_1:Oh so the game originated in Japan? baseball card collectors can have a hidden fortune and people wouldnt know	agent_2 likes hobby. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobby', 'baseball', 'sports'].
10845	agent_1:So do you go to a lot of concerts? agent_2:I actually do!  Love music and going to concerts!  Do you like Linkin Park?  They played 324 concerts in 2001 alone.  That's a lot of shows in one year! agent_1:Yes it is. I don't like them though. I'm more of a country person. agent_2:Country is good too!  I was never much of a Ramones fan but they toured almost non stop for 20 years playing a total of 2,263 concerts.  That's a crazy high number of shows. agent_1:Definitely! I've never heard of them though. Did you know that Creed was sued in 2002 because their concert was so bad? agent_2:I didn't know that!  They must have been really really bad. lol  There's an old ancient Roman amphitheatre in Croatia that's still used as a concert venue.  That would be neat to see. agent_1:Yes it would. Do you play piano. I love it but can't play it. agent_2:I like it and tried several times when I was younger but couldn't get the hang of it. In 1930 there was no news worth reporting so the BBC decided to just play piano music instead. agent_1:That is something. I am astonished that someone managed to get a piano on top of Britain's highest mountain lol.	"agent_2:Wow.  Wondered how in the heck they did that?  I couldn't even imagine taking on that task.  Both Freddie Mercury and Paul McCartney used the same piano to record their hits ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and ""Hey Jude"".

9915	agent_1:did you know between 9pm -12 am netflix accounts for a third of the bandwidth in north america agent_2:I can believe that. My son watches movies all the time along with TV shows and Netflick originals. He got me hooked on Stranger Things. agent_1:a guy racked up $40 in late fees on a vhs so he started netflix agent_2:I remember the days of rentals. What a pain that was. Now we sit at home and just stream everything. I still like to get Netflix dvds cause I don't understand how to stream. My son laughs at me. agent_1:well apparently netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth so maybe you aren't the only one! agent_2:Yes, there's a lot of us old fogeys around. I liked them better before they changed their homepage. I find it very hard to find films anymore.Amazing that they are almost totally world-wide. agent_1:I agree. I hate the new set up. I didnt realalize netflix started its own content in 2012. I thought it was much more recent than that agent_2:Well at first I'm sure everyone thought that their self production shows would be like Japanese sci-fi films, not worth watching. but some of their shows are very highly rated. agent_1:do you like star wars? james earl jones only spent 2.5 hours recording all of darth vaders lines and was paid $7500 i cant decide if that was a lot or a little in the 70s agent_2:It was low for voice actors then but he certainly made the character more evil than anyone else could have. That series has made so many people rich. Especially George Lucas. agent_1:in 2018 the total value for the star wars franchise was $65 BILLION. Thats insane agent_2:Yes and that launched the career of many people, the most notable being Han Solo. The acting in the first was atrocious but got better as more movies were made. All told a great movie. agent_1:I think its great that george lucas' wife marcia won an academy award for editing while george didn't win any for directing agent_2:He got his through notoriety. I think everyone knows his name. Some of the lingo has worked it's way into our language. Did you know that watching that movie was what made James Cameron go into directing? agent_1:I did not know that. In the original transformers movie there are 1.53 explosions per minute lol. Michael Bay must love to blow things up agent_2:I think so! Special effects have become a huge part of action movies now, along with CGI of course. I guess the dept. of Defense has big ideas about transformers. agent_1:well those CGI effects took 38 hours to render one frame of movement	agent_2:I'm not a computer whiz but I have watched my son do his tricks as an IT expert and sometimes it takes him hours to resolve issues.

4574	agent_1:Have you ever seen the movie Snowden agent_2:Not yet. I know that's about the whistle blower who escaped to Russia, right?  agent_1:Yeah founder of Wikileaks. You know they published the government's plans to destroy them.  agent_2:That's right. I forgot that he found Wikileaks also. I didn't know that, but I recently learned that the government owns 86% of NV land. agent_1:That's a lot of land to be own by the government, what's their game plan, lol agent_2:Maybe Snowden knows! Apparently governments are to abide by governing principles that are to balance individual freedom and tyranny. agent_1:Yeah sounds suspect. In 2006, the us passed legislation that would protect government employees from being prosecuted for violating the Geneva conventions agent_2:Also sounds suspect. Did you know that Albert Einstein was asked to be Israel's president? But he declined. agent_1:That's deep. Franklin D.

I am kind of frightened that there is a breed of jelly fish that are immortal. Yikes! agent_1:And lobster!  They are immortal in a sense that their organs dont age,  so as long as nothing kills them they can technically live forever.  agent_2:Yuck. I don't like that at all. One of the most interesting fish is the balck swallower fish that can eat prey twice its own length and ten times its weight. Sounds like one of those creepy snakes that eat huge animals.	agent_1:Yuck?  Ah you dont like seadfood?

I'm curious. agent_2:I honestly never heard about it, but read couple minutes ago. I'm wondering is it only Japan, but any Asian country as well.  agent_1:Interesting, do you know if they play a championship game there? And if so, what is it called?>  agent_2:I have no idea. But if so, why US teams don't play aganst Japanese? lol It could the World Cup like in soccer/footaball every January 4 teams from different continents play  agent_1:I don't know, curious why we call it a world series but the two countries never play each other.  agent_2:Absolutely. Have you read an article about Chicago Cubs recently? agent_1:No, I didn't see it. Apparently when they won the 2016 series 5 million people celebrated.  agent_2:It also was the first baseball team to win back-to-back world series. I actually didn't know it. agent_1:Awesome. They are one of the oldes teams. agent_2:True. As well as Atlanta Braves. It's wonderful! 	agent_1:I didn't know that.

Did you know there is a planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways? agent_1:Did not know that! It seems to me that you are interested in space? agent_2:I like space.  Not enough to be hugely educated in it though lol I know Jupiter's storms can be heard on an Am radio though!  Never actually listened to it.  agent_1:Do you believe that life exists outside of Earth? I'm on the fence, but I've heard that astronomers have some evidence of life 455 light-years away. agent_2:Yes,  I think so.  Its just weird that out of all those planets and space and galaxies that we are the only planet with life.  agent_1:I agree. Sometimes I just look at the moon at night and think about how small we all are compared to what else is out there! agent_2:I know right,  just thinking about space and everything out there is very humbling.  We are so tiny.  agent_1:We definitely are. Have you ever seen the movie Wall-E? Some of it takes place on a spaceship! agent_2:I have seen it but I dont remember all of it lol.   agent_1:I just love that movie. I love Pixar. Did you know that they have a secret room that is often visited by celebrities? agent_2:I did,  Ive always wondered what was in there lol I hope free sandwiches lol  agent_1:I'm sure there are. Celebrities have a lot of perks. Wish I was one! agent_2:Robin Williams was the first actor to start the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films.  That seems fun,  I wouldnt mind being a voice actor,  I do not want to be a celebrity at all,  just rich lol Seems like they have a tough life.  agent_1:Yeah, but being rich takes a load of stress off of your shoulders. For example, Judge Judy makes $123,000 per episode! agent_2:Yeah thats why I would just want to be rich,  i dont care about being a celebrity at all.  agent_1:Well, I guess normal people have it easy. We can just play video games all day! agent_2:Tom Hanks' brother does the Woody voice in the video games and merchandise.  agent_1:Interesting! I guess kids in South Korea have it rough. It's illegal for them to play video games past midnight. agent_2:Wow really,  I had no idea,  I wonder how they regulate that  agent_1:Same here! I think I'm going to go play more video games now.

That's pretty cool about chickens, there are over 10000 birds that classify as tetrapods.	agent_2:I'm sure that some like hummingbirds don't lend themselves to eating, but I know that ostrich steaks are a thing; I wonder how to cook those!

You? agent_1:I use that and bing so I can earn some amazon gift cards. agent_2:How does the gift card thing work? agent_1:Look up bing rewards.  You earn points for doing searches but they have a limit on the amount you can earn each day.  Did you know that google was created over 20 years ago already in 1998? agent_2:Yes. Wish I'd invested in Google stock when they made 2004 public offering! agent_1:Oh yeah!  A single google search requires more computing power than it took to send men to the moon! agent_2:Right. Mind-boggling, but shows advancements in tech. svcs. and products, doesn't it? agent_1:Yes!  Google maps calculates traffic by tracking how fast android devices are moving on the road.  That's pretty mind boggling too.  So they are pretty much tracking cell phones and using some of the data for that.  Interesting. agent_2:Well said. Did you know that if you wanted, say, to find a location in the disputed region of Kashmir, Google would show you only the map of the claims of the country (India or Pakistan) where the browser you're using is located? agent_1:I didn't know that before but now I do!  Thanks!  Do you remember when Google went down for about 5 minutes on Aug. 16th 2013 and took 40 percent of the web traffic with it?  I don't remember it. agent_2:Me, either, but I do know that internet companies like Google, or Amazon, use tech that is often beyond my comprehension...Do you suppose that's the point, really? agent_1:It might be.  I'm a big Amazon customer.  Are you? agent_2:In the past few years, have ordered books and supplies from Amazon, yes. They have - almost anything, don't they? agent_1:Yes.  I have Prime and we got rid of the cable because the video streaming service for Prime is worth the price of Prime every year. agent_2:Heard that streaming is great, and that Amazon is producing original fillms and TV shows. My fav. is The Grand Tour. agent_1:My kids like the Grand Tour.  Amazon now will even deliver your packages on Sundays because they have a contract with the US post office for the delivery service. agent_2:Convenient, too. If we lived in China, the giant e-commerce co. would be Alibaba. Did you know its founder was turned down by Harvard & Yale as an under-grad. student? Think they're sorry, now? agent_1:I didn't know that!  I bet they are.  Jeff Bezos has made so much money off of Amazon that he built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years! agent_2:Far out - in time, that is. Brilliant guy, though. Has vision. Even named a building on Amazon's Seattle campus after his 1st Amazon customer! Why not? agent_1:That is neat!  IMDB is also owned by Amazon since 1998. agent_2:Yes. Whether it's Amazon (big, powerful warriors) or Alibaba (magical) the AI these giants employ is beyond me. How about you? agent_1:AI scares me.  lol  I don't trust it.

I know that it can earn some people lots of money. agent_1:Well, let me inform you! They once used a helicopter to dry the grass for the 69 us open! agent_2:A helicopter? Well, I guess rich folk have all kind of resources at their disposal. Never needed to do that again, I guess. agent_1:I would have just had to tried to blow it dry with my breath. Would have taken forever! agent_2:They know how to think big in tennis, that's for sure. The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days. I wonder if anyone watched the whole thing. agent_1:They would have been sleepy after! Like I am after binge watching some netflix. agent_2:Netflix has fostered so much binge watching. People spend weekends immobile because of Netflix. agent_1:I know! hey have 137 million subscribers worldwide! THat's crazy! agent_2:The cash flow must be solid. They are expanding all the time, but still pay a lot in postage. I wonder why. agent_1:I wondered that too! They do make up half of internet traffic along with youtube! agent_2:That's intense. People love video. The origins of the company are funny, though. agent_1:What is the origin? agent_2:After racking up a $40 late fee on a vhs copy of apollo 13, reed hastings was inspired to start Netflix. Reed got angry, and started a new company that put Blockbuster out of business. agent_1:What a dumb and inefficient way to make $40! That came back to bit them in the rear! agent_2:Yes. Blockbuster underestimated the value of Netflix too.  agent_1:Yeah! They were off by quite a bit. Like $2B!	agent_2:I think BB imagined that they could copy Netflix easily.

What do you think? agent_1:To be honest it has to be possible think about all the species of animals especially the ones we don't even know about in the ocean. Dolphins are already smarter then us so how could aliens not exist agent_2:I so believe we'll eventually find some.  But, I feel kind of like Stephen Hawking, it's dangerous to be communicating with them. agent_1:But what if people like stephan hawking understood things we dont' he is on another level of intelligence kind of like elon musk they are the human versions of aliens with their brains agent_2:I agree with you about that.  If we found some aliens, I'd say let's watch them for a good long time before any attempts at communication and they probably feel the same way about communicating with us. agent_1:Exactly if aliens wanted to harm us they could have easily already have done it, they don't want to interfere with us we shouldn't interfere with them agent_2:I agree, there's something to it, though when the UN has a contigency plan in place should aliens ever attempt to contact the Earth.  So, somebody knows something, they just can't alert the masses and create panic around the world.	agent_1:So true and don't you find it wierd how drones were first military technology and then a couple of years later it becomes available to the public.

But, I haven't been able to afford them in recent years.  agent_1:What type of shoes do you think best for protecting one's feet? agent_2:I think any shoes with good soles are the best for protecting your feet. You need good support.  agent_1:I have little arch in my feet and I am seeking comfortable shoes. Do you have any suggesting? agent_2:I think the higher end shoes have better support in the soles. But, if you can't afford better shoes, you can always add sole supports in the shoes.  agent_1:Yes, I agree, I am referring to steel toe work shoes. Would you spend $15.00 to have a piece placed under your shoes? agent_2:No, I don't think so. I think many steel toed shoes already have the pieces in place.  agent_1:Another question, did you know that a tea bag can absorb unpleasant odor in shoes? agent_2:No, I didn't. But they can remove smells from gym bags, too. That's a good way to get those smells out. I used to wipe mine out with a Lysol wipe.  agent_1:Would you wear clothes made from animal skin? agent_2:I wear leather shoes, and they are made of animal skin...so I guess the answer is yes. Would you? agent_1:Yes, if it's made from leather, but I had to wear clothes with gator skin. I guess it's a mind game with me. agent_2:It seems people think it is acceptable to wear some clothes from certain types of animal skin but not others. It always reminds me of the movie 101 Dalmatians. Did you see that movie? agent_1:I saw about 15 minutes, but I didn't get the understanding of the movie.	agent_2:I really liked the movie.

I like the Dodgers therefore I am anti-yankee. agent_1:They had a great rivalry when both were in NY. It's crazy Babe Ruth would ever try to steal a base considering how big he was agent_2:I wonder how many stolen bases he had in his career.

Just revealing their 3 rd child's name - Chicago blew up social media.  agent_1:Yeah it's crazy,  and all their businesses are completely run by other people.

Are you familiar with K-pop? agent_2:I'm kind of familiar with it. agent_1:Me too. There are several songs that stick in my head It's catchy. There is a K-pop band called Moranbong Band that is the most popular music group in the country. I am not familiar with their music.  agent_2:I've never heard of them before. I heard that rejection letters from Sub Pop Records to aspiring artists start with ""Dear loser."" That's kind of disheartening. agent_1:Wow! I new they were an edgy company but that's harsh. Did you know that Ricky Gervais was a pop singer in the 80's? I cannot picture that.  agent_2:I've heard that and I can't believe it. I'm glad he stuck with comedy instead of that. agent_1:Me too.

Did you know that Abba turned down $1 BILLION to do a 100 concert reunion tour? agent_1:I did not. Wow! They must still have a lot of money saved to be able to turn that down. I don't like to laugh at the misfortune of others but I find it amusing that concert attendees filed a lawsuit against Creed because their concert was so bad.  agent_2:That is pretty funny. It must have been towards then end of Creed.  agent_1:I would assume so. I also recently learned that Pink Floyd held a concert in 1972 with no audience. I wonder why they did that? agent_2:Oh wow, that's kind of odd. I heard that in 2010 Lou Reed and his wife held a high frequency concert for dogs. I'm sure they enjoyed it.  agent_1:Lou Reed is a weird guy so I'm not that surprised. There is an ancient Roman amphitheater in Croatia that is used as a concert venue. I bet that would be amazing.

There's a store in Alabama that only sells clothes, cameras, etc. that are found in unclaimed baggage.  agent_1:Normally bigger corporations have enough power to make decisions like that. But that's not ethical is it  agent_2:Yea I don't think that's ethical either. agent_1:I think it has a clear link with the use of animals by many companies.... Using fur without consent kinda resembles using unclaimed baggage agent_2:Yea I think so too.  agent_1:Germany was the first country to give rights to animals do you agree with that?  agent_2:Wow I didn't know that. I agree with that though.  agent_1:I do too, but I mean it includes animals like the lochness monster... haha agent_2:haha. Did you know rip curl makes clothes in North Korea yet the label says China?  agent_1:Really ?? thats crazy ! isn't that so unethical also.... the people that make the clothes probably don't even get paid enough....

Did you know years from now the earth will be helium-free?  agent_1:I did not know that.  I do find it sad however, that 80 percent of earth's forests have already been destroyed. agent_2:Yeah I think I read that somewhere as well.  It is very sad to me to think about that, and I'm sure it will continue to be destroyed.  agent_1:We think of a day as being 24 hours long.  But when Earth was first formed, a day was only 5.5 hours! agent_2:That is crazy to think how much longer the days are now.  Imagine going back to 5.5 days! You would feel like you lived a lifetime in a week lol.  agent_1:If earth's  history was viewed in a 24 hour period.  Humans would only represent about 1 minute and 17 seconds.

Some of them can be cool though, like that poem that when read normally is depressing and vice versa agent_2:there is a 274 line poem called the chaos, i am assuming becaus it has irregularly pronounced words agent_1:I would assume so too. THe Javanese alphabet too, if recited in order it forms a poem agent_2:the vikings were warrior poets. lol what the heck? did they just shout poetry at the enemy ? agent_1:Hahaha maybe that is how they fought. Allan Poe received only $9 for his poem The Raven. Not is is priceless agent_2:isn't that always the way? things don't become priceless until the person is dead. baltimore must be the place for poetry! first edgar allen poe and also tupac  agent_1:Yeah it seems that way.

Did you know they partially funded monty python and the holy grail? agent_1:I didn't know that! That's awesome though! Do you know how ""Black dog"" got its name for a song? agent_2:It appears there was a dog wandering around the studio! Interesting, I never knew that! Speaking of recording songs, NWAs straight outta compton was the first album to reach platinum status without a major tour. agent_1:That is so cool. That means it was really good haha. Did you know Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory is the best-selling album of the 21st century? agent_2:That's actually pretty surprising! Two twins in Japan released a rap album when they turned 100. It's never too late I guess. agent_1:Well said! I would love to hear it sometime haha. The Dark Side of the Moon was still one of the top albums in 2014, 40 years after release! agent_2:That's pretty awesome! Reel big fish had to rerecord all their hits for a best of album after losing the rights to their old record label. Ouch. agent_1:Well at least they could remember how the songs went haha.

12426	agent_1:What do you think of remakes of movies and cartoons? agent_2:I enjoy remakes if they are done well.  agent_1:I think Disney is planning to remake the Lion King.  Disney released the first trailer for next year for the Lion King remake. agent_2:That's correct. Disney is calling the new Lion King remake a live action film but it relies almost exclusively on CGI so a lot of people consider it annimation. agent_1:I do too. A related debate arose when Avatar was released, with the Visual Effects Society honoring James Cameron's 2009 epic for, among other trophies, animated character in a live-action feature motion picture agent_2:I agree that these kinds of films are skirting the line between traditional annimation and heavily CGI assisted live action films. With the improvements in the technology I'm not sure it makes sense anymore to feel the need to classify such films in the traditional modes. agent_1:Yeah I feel the same way of course Jon Favreau, the director of the Lion King remake has naturally walked down this valley before, with his update of The Jungle Book.  agent_2:Yes, the difference being that the Jungle Book still had a human character and therefore a true live action person was seen on screen. The Lion King contains no humans and so it is likely that everything is CGI. agent_1:Technology is all consuming. During the 70s, disney recycled a lot of their animation frames, resulting in identical scenes in some movies agent_2:That was a different time, generating those frames took so long that it made sense to recycle those that you could. Creation is a much quicker process now with the aid of computer programs.	agent_1:Did you know that Frozen was the first animated Disney film directed by a woman.	agent_2 likes movie. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'movies', 'remakes'].

He's just out there. Just like how he thinks AIDS is a man-made disease.  agent_2:I just don't care for him. I would have loved to have been in the courtroom, the day a judge decided to give her ruling to Eminem, in rap style. agent_1:That would have been funny.

They had an amazing start to the year, and then they won the World Series. agent_1:Holy crap, nice. Probably fat bonuses for everybody... but hey... if they made their fans happy, why the heck not... they earned it ! agent_2:They did.  It was almost too easy.  They have great pitchers, good hitters, and a new manager.  Normally, a new manager isn't a help, but he was from the team who won the World Series the year before, The Houston Astros. agent_1:Huh... do You think he knows a secret for winning World Series ? ;)  idk... I think it's just a well paid team ;) agent_2:Money and chemistry build winning teams, if you ask me.  Baseball is popular in the US, Japan, and a few other places.  Is it played much in Poland? agent_1:Not really, but we do buy baseball bats :) to go watch soccer games on a stadium :) agent_2:You buy bats?  Why?  I used to collect baseball cards, which can be quite valuable! agent_1:well... when one soccer team meets other soccer team and those two towns/teams are not friendly... You need to take whatever You can smuggle to the stadium to fight off the hooligans from the other team ;) lol - baseball bats are selling good in Poland but nobody plays the game ;) lol agent_2:ah ... that's a little scary.  I suppose without a baseball bat, my simple weapon of choice would be  ...  something else I can't think of.  Fascinating.  I do like soccer.  I'm a Croat (half really), so the World Cup was exciting this year.

It is a nod to Kanye's hometown and the city is special to K & K  so the name is perfect because baby Chicago was hard to conceive so she is extra special as well.  agent_1:That's a pretty sweet meaning.

I'm pretty sure her mom released it on purpose.  agent_2:Maybe. I know Kim is on the 2015 Time Magazine's list of 100 most influential people. agent_1:She definitely has a lot of influence. She recently met with trump to discuss prison reform.   agent_2:I did not know that, but good for her. I know she also has a book about how she is a trailblazer of the selfie movement. agent_1:Yeah, she's definitely a busy and hardworking person. Speaking of celebrities, did you know Judge Judy makes $123,000 an episode?	"agent_2:Holy cow! That is a lot of money! I wonder where she rates on Hollywood's likability ""q score""?

12752	agent_1:hey did you know the Senate used a gavel for 165 years until Nixon cracked it agent_2:Hello - no I did not know that. Pretty cool.  agent_1:ya he ruined it! there is a Candy desk in the senate apparently, sounds delicious! agent_2:That does sound pretty good! Michael Jordan once responded that republicans buy shoes too so he didn't endorse the democratic candidate.  agent_1:haha well I wish more people took his advice and kept out of politics, really weird that women couldnt wear pants in the senate until 1993 agent_2:haha yea I was just reading that. Said something about staging a protest wearing pantsuits.  agent_1:ya it was Barbara Mikulski and Carl Moseley who did a protest by wearing pantsuits agent_2:That's funny. Did you know there hasn't been a president who wasn't a republican or democrat since 1853? agent_1:no that is kind of crazy, also crazy is that only republicans have beards apparently, no democrat presidents have had one agent_2:Wow that's crazy I had no idea they never have had a beard as a democrat.  agent_1:no I didn't either, also crazy is that the use of red and blue colors only started in 2000 for repubs and ems agent_2:Interesting....I didn't know that either. The last republican was elected  president without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was 1928. agent_1:wow, but I think that is outdated information because Trump is now president haha agent_2:Yea I think so too lol. What are your thoughts on Trump? agent_1:Eh I don't talk politics but I do think it's funny that Truman wouldn't get a picture taken with Dumbo because he didn't want to be associated with the republican party. agent_2:haha yea that's funny! I try not to talk politics myself.  agent_1:yup jost not worth it, did you know that in athens they used to choose elections by just the lottery? agent_2:That's pretty crazy they used the lottery for elections. I saw that since 1900, the taller candidate has won the presidential election 75% of the time. agent_1:ya so the democrats should maybe run a basketball player in 2020? haha, but ya its scary that in 2012 international election observers were blocked from 9 states agent_2:HAHA that's a good one!

12339	agent_1:hi,  do you like animals?  did you know the loch ness monster is a protected species?  agent_2:I did not know that. That will come in handy once we find one. Also,Germany was the first country in the world to universally give animals legal rights that were constitutionally guaranteed. This was in 2002. agent_1:Sweet!  hmmm domesticated animals develop a white patch,  I wonder if that is only towards horses or all animals.  agent_2:Yeah, I wonder if that occurs naturally or because of how they are bred.	agent_1:Maybe.  I know Orcas dorsal fin tends to flop over in captivity but it the wild the dorsal fin it straight up. 	agent_2 dislikes captivity. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['captivity', 'animals', 'cross-breeding'].
5130	agent_1:Hello,  do you like baseball? agent_2:You bet. Do you know why the managers wear a uniform? agent_1:I believe its because they are able to play in the game if needed. Thats kinda cool,  I hope they never have to though.   agent_2:Yeah it is pretty cool. I wonder if they do that more in Japan where they take the game more seriously agent_1:I hear that they are surprised to know that baseball is an american thing lol  agent_2:Yeah it seems so. Do you know who used to do the scheduling for the major league games? agent_1:Not sure,  who?  A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in an attic!!  lucky guy! agent_2:Yeah that is amazing. It was a couple who did it for 24 years in a row agent_1:Wow, the must really love baseball!  That is a lot of time dedicated to the sport,  that is really sweet that they had something they were both passionate about though.  agent_2:Exactly because scheduling 2430 games every year is no easy feat agent_1:I know right!  Probably after a few years they developed a working system or a program. agent_2:Yeah that is a high possibility too. Do you know when the World Series was founded? agent_1:No I dont.  When? agent_2:It was founded in 1903 and at that time even the ottoman empire was in existence still agent_1:Interesting.  did you know the chicago cubs were the first team to win back to back world series? agent_2:Yes they were but then they were cursed or something because they have not won anymore since then agent_1:I hear they actually did win again,  in 2016. agent_2:Oh right when they had that huge celebration with 5 million people out in the streets agent_1:Yes,  the largest gathering of humans in history!!	agent_2:That is pretty impressive.

I've never watched the show, but I wonder if it gives you tips on what to do in case of an invasion? I understand there are some firefighters that are trained to treat aliens. agent_1:I used to watch the show. Pretty weird that Tom Cruise has a $10 million underground bunker to protect himself from aliens.  agent_2:It is curious. I mean, since the leader of his religion is an alien, as I understand it, you'd think he'd be okey doke with aliens. agent_1:Crazy, what religion is he?  agent_2:Scientology. It's a mix of sci-fi and self help, with a nice dose of pyramid scheme added in.  agent_1:Oh yeah, I've seen shows on that. That is crazy. I wonder if they could make a franchise out of that similar to the Alien's movie franchise.  agent_2:With aliens from the deep? I'd love that. Of course, the Scientology aliens come from volcanoes, which is a whole other...thing."	agent_1:That would be a pretty cool movie. They could even have a cameo from Bill Nye the science guy!	agent_2 likes movie. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'movie', 'no'].
400	agent_1:Do you like wearing hats? It has so many functions! agent_2:I don't like them on myself but I know a lot of people that can pull them off.  agent_1:Yes me as well. In the military hats denote a nationality, branch of service, rank or regiment. agent_2:I noticed the different hats in the military but did not know it had to do with rank.  agent_1:Yes they have a function to play. In the old west, the most popular hat was the bowler! agent_2:Wow! They always show a stetson or something close so I'm shocked by that.  agent_1:Yes me as well! Tipping of ones hat arises from the knights raising their face visors. Very chivalry of them!	agent_2:That's a very interesting fact.

6460	agent_1:Do you know anything about the dance program at Duke University? agent_2:No, I don't really but they recently celebrated the opening of the new Rubenstein arts center. agent_1:Who was Duke's first vice Provost for the arts? agent_2:Scott Lindroth I believe. I love how they have these applied arts programs to bring them balance and something different and meaningful to them. agent_1:I heard that since his time, Duke has grown to have 98 student arts groups. agent_2:That is really amazing, love this idea. they have so many more classes directed at the arts now more than ever which is awesome.  agent_1:I wonder how many programs are devoted to the acoustic piano? agent_2:I love the piano, but not sure how many programs are devoted to it. by aligning art making with research it makes for a much deeper learning experience though. agent_1:I am a fan too.    Odd that the modern piano has been around since roughly 1700! agent_2:Right! L played years ago, and I also love poetry. Everyone should have a creative side they let out. It is amazing that they found a piano at the top of britains highest mountain....crazy to think how it got up there lol agent_1:It is funny that they test pianos with Circus Galop, a piece no human could play! agent_2:Hahaha, that is odd! I love researching fun facts on the computer and you can find so much! I use my computer for everything, I write some poetry and save it to my computer.....you could probably find a program to teach you piano on the computer lol. agent_1:Perhaps so.    It is funny that poetry goes back to prehistorical times, but we still can not teach a computer to compose it well! agent_2:Exactly, there will always be a need for human emotion which nothing tech wise could ever do. The Edgar Allan Poe poem, the Raven was fantastic and he was only paid 9 bucks for it. Wow.... agent_1:Conversely, something as simple as the Japanese Alphabet, when recited in order is also a poem! agent_2:I think I read about that while on my computer, and that is amazing actually. I will have to look it up I want to see what it is all about! agent_1:Did you know that in 1936, Russians made a computer that ran on water! agent_2:Really? That is awesome! something else to research on my computer, I love reading cool facts. Almost all of the Hobbit's character names were taken out of an old poem, how funny! agent_1:Indeed!     I wonder if something similar inspired Demetri Martin's 224 word palmindrome poem. agent_2:Exactly! I need to read that poem, must be very good. I am wanting to find that poem that is read normally is found to be depressing but reading it backwards is inspiring!

3317	agent_1:Do you like Baseball? agent_2:I do, I watch mainly during the world series times though agent_1:Same here, I rooted for LA since I am from Cali.  But Boston is good too. agent_2:I always rooted for Atlanta growing up.  They were a lot more dominant then. agent_1:I rooted for the A's.  That was crazy when the A's played the SF Giants and we had the Earthquake here.  We won and got that Commisioners Trophy! agent_2:Wow, an earthquake during a game?   agent_1:Yep.  The big one where a section of the Bay Bridge collapsed and the Marina District caught on fire.  The game was suspended for a few days but I think A's won it 4 of 4 out of 7 games possible. agent_2:Wow.  Thats crazy.  Im from Florida, so we have hurricanes, but we have quite a bit more warning.  lol agent_1:Did you know the baseball coaches wear uniforms because they can actually play if needed lol. agent_2:Yeah, I wonder if they ever needed to step in, or it is just a tradition. agent_1:I think it is in the rule book.  It is called America's pastime but I dont know....seems like there are more NFL and NBA fans at least out here. agent_2:It does seem that way around here too.  Baseball is actually really popular in Japan. agent_1:I heard that often...what is weird is why Kickball is called Soccer-Baseball in canada? agent_2:It kinda makes since you kick it and operate like baseball, but seems clunky as a name, in my opinion agent_1:I guess a leg subs for the bat lol. agent_2:Yeah.  Did you know that the albuquerque isotopes are named after the team in the Simpsons? agent_1:Smart, use a team already branded by one of the longest running shows in history.   agent_2:It would help sell merch.  people would want some because of the show.  	agent_1:I don't think anyone will copy the Red Sox name, they have had it since 1901!	agent_2 dislikes copyright. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['copyright', 'hobby', 'sports'].

If you think about it, a lot of power comes from water.  agent_2:Yes such as hydropower. Apple computer's seem to be quite sensitive because if you smoke near an Apple Computer it voids the warranty. agent_1:Interesting. That doesn't sound true, but I wonder if it is the same for the iphone? agent_2:I don't know what you mean? There is a group called transhumanist's that want to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks! agent_1:That sounds pretty cool. I would do it, would you?  agent_2:I don't know sounds kind of creepy to me! Almost like the work of fiction! Like something from someones imagination! agent_1:I think it would be pretty cool.

Do you know why managers wear uniforms during the game? agent_1:I think they can rush on the field at a moment's notice to play a position. Highly unlikely though. agent_2:Yeah, interesting and good for them just in case. Do you know what kickball is called in Canada? agent_1:I dunno. Canadian kickball? agent_2:It is actually called soccer-baseball agent_1:That makes sense. Canadians would find the middle-of-the-road term for the sport. What about the man who found three million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic? That's pretty cool. agent_2:That is for sure, he made a lot of money there.

He plays the character of Neil Armstrong.  It was released Friday. agent_2:Did you watch the movie?  Was it really a space movie? agent_1:I haven't seen it yet.  Today was the first time I heard of it. agent_2:It is hard to talk about this movie if we both have not seen it.  Can we change the topic? agent_1:Let's talk about Earth.  It's the third planet from the sun.   agent_2:Apparently, 80 percent of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed.  It's depressing to me. agent_1:That is sad for sure.  Sad that people are the cause of it too. agent_2:When the earth was first formed, there was only 5.5 hours long in a day.   agent_1:Wow.  I didn't know that.  71 percent of the earth's surface is covered by water.  I wonder what covers the polar regions? agent_2:Ice?  I am not sure though.  Apparently, earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century. agent_1:Yes.  Ice is right.  It's almost like the history of the earth is like watching a science fiction movie only in real life. agent_2:I like science fiction.  I like to imagine things, like aliens in a different planet. agent_1:Do you like Starship Troopers?   agent_2:Yes, because it is the only science fiction novel recommended by three branches of the military.  I wonder why they recommended it though - do you know? agent_1:I have no idea.  lol  The word robotics was made up by a book writer - Isaac Asimov.  Seems like robots and space are always a big theme for science fiction books and movies.  agent_2:By the way, do you know that the United Nations appointed an ambassador to greet extraterrestrials in case they want to say hello to us? agent_1:That's interesting!  What a job to have!  That's just like something out of the movie Star Wars, which came out in 1977 and the value of that franchise is now $65 billion dollar!  agent_2:Wow.  That is a lot of money.  I heard that it is currently the 5th largest grossing media franchise.  agent_1:Initially 20th century fox was convinced that Star Wars was going to be a flop.  Wow we're they wrong. agent_2:They were wrong indeed.  George Lucas got a better deal by forgoing $500k directing fee. agent_1:James Earl Jones only made $7,500 for 2 1/2 hours of work providing the voice for Darth Vader.  Thought he would have spent more time and made more money recording that voice. agent_2:I do not think $7500 is a lot of money to provide Darth Vader's voice because the movie was very successful.  What do you think? agent_1:I wonder if the actors get any royalties from the movie?   agent_2:They should.  George Lucas should be generous since he got so much money from Star Wars. agent_1:You would think!  He's a billionaire from the movie! agent_2:Rich people are often cheap. agent_1:That's sad...but so true.  I've seen it too much during my working lifetime where the people at the top get richer and the workers on the factory floor just barely have enough money to live on."	agent_2:I wonder if someone was fired at fox because of George Lucas deal.

4722	"agent_1:What did you think of the article about the shootings in Parkland agent_2:I thought it was very thoughtful and sad about all the mass shootings around in FL and Las Vegas agent_1:I thought it was sad too. It's a shame that people have to resort to shooting students as well as teachers. It's not even safe to go to school anymore agent_2:I wish there could be non-polarizing discussions on it between society and politicians agent_1:There needs to be a conversation about it. Maybe it will reach out to people and the shootings will stop. Parents shouldn't have to worry about what's going to happen to their children when they send them to school. agent_2:I guess it's important to vote for politicians who care about the people they represent and not lobbyists or the party line agent_1:Exactly. All certain politicians care about is money.They don't care about what is best for people. If they did, things would be better and maybe the violence would end. agent_2:Yep, in ancient athens officials were appointed by lottery to avoid an oligarchy agent_1:Maybe that should be done here in the U.S. Most likely Trump wouldn't be in office if the elections was done by lottery. agent_2:No, unfortunitly voter turnout hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years so that may be why the country is in such bad shape agent_1:You're probably right. Some people feel like their vote doesn't count so they don't bother. Then again, maybe the taller candidate won as the article claims. That does explain how certain people are elected agent_2:I think Nevada has it right with the option ""none of the candidates"" as a voting option agent_1:I think they have it right too. It gives you the option not to vote for people you don't think are good enough to be in office agent_2:People vote for interesting things, Austin TX voted to rename their garbage dump to Fred Durst"	agent_1:They really do.

12912	agent_1:Good morning.  So, the other day I was shopping for a shirt and then I heard that originally shirts used to be an item worn exclusively by men.  How strange. agent_2:Maybe because women only wore dresses? agent_1:Maybe, that would make sense.  In America we will call most anything a shirt, but in British English it is specifically what we would refer to as a dress shirt.  That could be confusing if you are visiting another country. agent_2:Oh, so that is probably what they meant-women did not used to wear dress shirts. agent_1:Maybe.  I am glad I don't work somewhere I have to wear dress shirts or button up shirts.  There are also button down shirts, which is where the collar also has buttons. agent_2:If you're in Hawaii, the official business attire is the aloha shirt. That seems fun. agent_1:Which is why I love Hawaii so much.  Aloha shirts are great.   agent_2:In China gangs used to layer on as many shirts as possible. That seems, um, uncomfortable. agent_1:Yeah, and they used to pop the collars.  I remember when popping your polo shirt collar was a fashion around here. agent_2:It's interesting that polo shirts were invented for one specific tennis player. agent_1:Yeah, the ones with the crocodile on them. agent_2:It's interesting that they got named polo shirts since polo players didn't adopt them until later. agent_1:It's funny how clothing gets certain names. agent_2:Yes, it is. I like to wear polos when I go out. I think they are fancy enough for a night out. I'd like to attend a monthly music fest that occurs at Gee's club. agent_1:Oh yeah?  I have heard about that place.  What kind of music is played there? agent_2:They play oldies. Since about a year and a half ago since the death of Royal Torrence, it's been a monthly affair.  agent_1:That sounds like a lot of fun.  I heard they have a lot of different musicians that play there. agent_2:Yeah, it is pretty popular. It's only a $5 donation. agent_1:Oh wow, that's neat that it is a donation and not a mandatory cover.  I am sure a lot of people go there to drink and dance and listen to all kinds of music.	agent_2:Yeah, it's cool that it started to celebrate someone's life when they died.

About 71% of the Earths surface is covered with water. agent_2:The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands agent_1:Yes!  The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice.  I think the ice packs have been shrinking in recent years. agent_2:Yes sadly. Just like the fact Earth will be helium free in the near future agent_1:Sad indeed.  Another sad fact is more than 80% of the Earth's natural forests have already been destroyed. agent_2:We have changed the earth so much in our short time. But did you know that if earths history were a 24 hour period we would only account for 1:17 mins agent_1:That makes me feel like a tiny ant. lol  When Earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long. agent_2:I wish work days would go by that fast! There would be a lot more days though. I like our 365 days agent_1:Yes!  Wouldn't that be nice.

I thought those had been around forever! agent_2:I know! It seems like forever since we had a president who wasn't a Democrat or Republican, since 1853 actuallY! agent_1:That is a long time.  Just goes to show you how long the two party system has really been in power. agent_2:yup I agree, we should change how elections are run, did you know that Back in athens a long time ago, they would just do a lottery to elect officials agent_1:I heard that was because they wanted to avoid oligarchy. agent_2:yup you're right, its sad though, the highest voter turnout we've ever had in the USA was 62.8% agent_1:Maybe if there were options like Nevada has people would vote!

The first cloned pet was a cat and its name was copy cat agent_2:That's interesting and a little funny.  I had no idea of this, but the cat is the most popular pet in the world.  DId you know that? agent_1:Wow, no I didn't know that.  There are more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia. agent_2:Now that I had no idea of.  Did you know that some tarantulas keep frogs as pets? agent_1:Wow, that's odd. Two of the most popular pets are dogs and cats agent_2:I have dogs and used to have cats too but dogs are my favorite.   agent_1:Dogs are my favorite also.

In 2006 a group of climbers reached the top of britain's highest mountain and found a piano agent_2:neat! apparently the competition away from its usual reliance on over-the-top spectacle. agent_1:An aluminum grand piano was built for the lounge of the airship hindenburg. it weighed only 356 pounds.	agent_2:Wow! I did not know that! Portuguese broadcaster RTP had stripped the Eurovision stage of the walls of LED screens that have become ubiquitous backdrops in recent years.	agent_1 likes music. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'greeting', 'outdoor activities'].

Why just ok? agent_2:No, I have visited Denver, Colorado, but not Aspen, Colorado. agent_1:Me too! What would be the three meals you would have? agent_2:I did order a bagel, meal balls and I love cheesecake, what about you? agent_1:Probably some protein like steak and a bunch of carbs. The egg and bacon bagel sounds really good though... agent_2:I guess Aspen and Denver Colorado are a lot the same, both places have lots of mountains great for skiing. agent_1:Yeah. Do you ski?	agent_2:Very little, but I fell several times before getting the hang of it, what about you?	agent_1 dislikes falling. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['falling', 'greeting', 'travel'].
2248	agent_1:Humans may have lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago. Do you know ? agent_2:That is fascinating, also like the evidence scientists discovered in New Mexico, ancient humans against giant sloths. agent_1:Scientists recently found a human print inside a ground sloth's paw marks. agent_2:It must be really popular as each year about 500,000 people visit the museum, humans dont stop to amaze me! agent_1:NIce! Animals and plants synthesize their own vitamin c, But humans cannot.	agent_2:That sure is an interesting fact, you know humans can regrow ribs and they will be as strong as before in about 2-3 months	agent_1 likes health. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['health', 'travel', 'favorite place'].

5164	agent_1:Do you follow baseball? agent_2:Yes. I am a dodger fan agent_1:Awesome!  I like Walker Buehler.  What do you think of the Dodgers/Reds trade?  Think it was a good one?   agent_2:No. They gave up too much. Puig was a pain in the neck, but one of the best defensive left fielders in baseball. The pitcher wood was a young guy who was an all star 2 years ago agent_1:I was kind of surprised when they did that trade.  Did you know baseball managers wear uniforms because they can technically play if needed? agent_2:Yes. I remember Pete Rose and Frank Robinson doing that agent_1:Yes.  How about the guy who found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards that were hidden in his grandfathers attic since the 1940s.  I'm not ashamed to admit that I still a few packs of baseball cards every year.  It gives me the thrill I had when I was kid opening them. agent_2:Yes my base baseball cards were thrown out many many years ago. I wish I had those back agent_1:They were super huge there in the late 80s and early 90s but have died down in popularity since then.  Did you know kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada? agent_2:Yes. I had heard that before. agent_1:I don't know if I would like to schedule the games.  For 24 years a married couple scheduled all MLB games played each year. agent_2:That sounds like a heck of a big job. agent_1:I would want no part of it.  Babe Ruth was thrown out stealing to end game 7 and lose the 1926 world series.

3171	agent_1:Hi there. Do you like to play video games? agent_2:I used to play them when I was younger. I was never good at Tetris though even though it is one of three best selling video games of all.  agent_1:I was into Tetris for a while. My mom got addicted to it and stole my Gameboy a lot. I wonder if she started seeing tetris blocks in her sleep. That happens to some people who play tetris for an extended period of time. agent_2:That is so weird! As an adult I wish i was good at Tetris when I quit smoking or trying to diet because it can offer a quick fix when people are struggling to stick to working on either. agent_1:Yeah, and they also will regularly identify tetromino shapes in real life like in patterns on buldings or in layouts of boxes. Haha, hilarous. agent_2:Okay, well then maybe I'm not so sad that I am not good at it. I would not want to deal with that. agent_1:Right? Haha. I didn't know that Tetris was actually from the Soviet Union. I thought it was just part of the Tetris design where there were Russian buildings. agent_2:Yes, Alexey Pajitinov was the original designer and programmer. agent_1:You mentioned that Tetris can help with addictions. Well it can also help with PTSD. So if you can deal with seeing Tetris shapes everywhere it might be a good option for PTSD. agent_2:Oh! I'm glad you're still here. I thought you were gone. Well, that is great for PTSD sufferers.  agent_1:No, it just takes me a while to think of what to say. Do you ever play dance video games? agent_2:No, but I enjoy dance performances. Did you know Tupac was a ballet dancer? agent_1:That is neat. Speaking of ballet dancers, they can go through four pairs of pointe shoes a week. Sounds painful and expensive! agent_2:Yes, that does, I agree! I think its cute that babies hear music and spontaneously dance. agent_1:When they hit the beat! So babies can hit the beat but it seems like a lot of us adult forget how to, haha. agent_2:I know I have a hard time! When babies hit the beat it makes them smile. agent_1:One thing that makes me smileis Michael Jackson's dance. I didn't know that to achieve lean he used a device which he patented. agent_2:That was smart. those moves were pretty extreme, so that explains a lot of how it was done. agent_1:Right. Bruce Lee was another great dancer. He won a Cha Cha championship.	agent_2:Did he really? Where did he do that? In the USA?

4376	agent_1:Hi partner, what type of shoes do you like? agent_2:I like all kinds of shoes. I prefer shoes that are more fashionable. But, I haven't been able to afford them in recent years.  agent_1:What type of shoes do you think best for protecting one's feet? agent_2:I think any shoes with good soles are the best for protecting your feet. You need good support.  agent_1:I have little arch in my feet and I am seeking comfortable shoes. Do you have any suggesting? agent_2:I think the higher end shoes have better support in the soles. But, if you can't afford better shoes, you can always add sole supports in the shoes.  agent_1:Yes, I agree, I am referring to steel toe work shoes. Would you spend $15.00 to have a piece placed under your shoes? agent_2:No, I don't think so. I think many steel toed shoes already have the pieces in place.  agent_1:Another question, did you know that a tea bag can absorb unpleasant odor in shoes?	agent_2:No, I didn't. But they can remove smells from gym bags, too. That's a good way to get those smells out. I used to wipe mine out with a Lysol wipe. 	agent_1 dislikes smell. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['smell', 'shoes', 'fashion'].

We are really into the subcultural of finding the hidden mickey mouse image in all things disney, its a fun hobby.  agent_1:yeah had seen few videos of the easter eggs of mickey in every production agent_2:Oh wow, thats cool. I never heard about that one either. I know Bill Nye was involved with disney, he is a funny scientist.  agent_1:for flubber well pretty rare to involve a scientist for a fictional movie. . good move by the team agent_2:Yea, good point. It was a great movie and well done. I havent watched it in a really long time though. Disney changed its name in 1986. They make bold moves. agent_1:bold moves  may be a  album with Kanye west would be boldest and unimaginable agent_2:Oh boy, yeah. Kayne West I heard that he believes AIDS is a man made disease. huh? agent_1:really ? I think something is wrong with that man agent_2:Yeah, odd thinking. He also did a skit about interrupting on awards show 2 years prior to really doing it. The skit was on SNL and he was mocking himself.   agent_1:still could not to resist to do it with taylor . Oh boy he truly know about his future may be he was feeling dejavu agent_2:Yeah, good point. Out of the top 10 most successful songs of all time is one of his actually. agent_1:pretty much unbelievable may be he should save his talent only for music and avoid talk shows	agent_2:Thats some sound advice!

It was about Billie Bean managing the A's. agent_2:Yes.  Do you know how many baseballs are used in a season? agent_1:I have no idea. I assume a ton. They lose a lot for home runs, foul balls, and then you just see them switch out balls occasionally. agent_2:160,000 i understand. agent_1:Wow. Have you ever caught a ball at a game? agent_2:No but we had someone who worked there that we know give us one haha. agent_1:I don't think I ever have. Do you remember people going nuts for Barry Bonds homerun balls? agent_2:Yeah, people dove into McCovey Cove to get them.

I wish we had those high speed buses that the dutch are making,  it travels like 160 mph. agent_2:it would indeed be a great pleasure to ride a bus like to work. it would save me so much time! agent_1:Yeah,  and when you ride the bus you can get stuff done too,  instead of driving.  agent_2:yes, i think that i would be way more productive on the dutch bus. i should move to holland. agent_1:Yes, that would be better than moving to Japan,  I guess it costs like $300 in tolls to cross the country.  agent_2:Yes, japan is far too expensive for most people. i think that it would be good to avoid japan and its expensive highways agent_1:I'm going next Feb.,  so I will avoid driving there lol  agent_2:you could take the train there. they have many trains that go around the country. agent_1:Awesome!  Yeah, I like public transportation when traveling its fun.  agent_2:yes, it is a good way to learn about a country. public transportation is a cheap and convenient way to travel in a foreign land. i recommend it. agent_1:The first king to travel around the world was the king of hawaii. agent_2:he must have had a hankering to see the world and understand other peoples and cultures. i admire his sense of adventure and curiosity. agent_1:Yeah I wonder when he did that,  I cant remember a time where Hawaii had a king lol agent_2:I think it was King Kamehameha. he was the last king, i believe. agent_1:I see.  I hear Iceland has no public rail service,  most natives fly across the country.	agent_2:that makes sense. iceland is very small and perhaps the terrain is not good for rail. planes could be very convenient.	agent_1 likes travel. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['travel', 'transportation', 'bus'].

It does have the second highest attendance. agent_1:Baseball games are fun to go to but they take a long time. I usually end up walking around the concourse for a couple innings. agent_2:I never knew why baseball managers wore uniforms. I thought it was just to blend in with the team and support the team. Ends up they are able to play if the need arises. agent_1:Looking at some of the managers today I think it's more of a tradition now. I know in the past there were a few times where there were actual player/coaches. I believe Ted Williams was one.	agent_2:I found it very surprising that a married couple had been scheduling all 2430 major league baseball games up until 2005.

Apparently publishers were not a fan when it was first being sent out for publication.  agent_2:Interesting. There is a university where you can study science fiction and fantasy literature with a concentration in Tolkien studies. agent_1:That would be an amazing class!

I just know each player uses a strung racket and they hit a hollow ball. agent_1:Did you know Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis? agent_2:I did know. I know Lacoste shirts had the crocodile and it was a symbol for Rene ""the crocodile"" lacoste who was a famous player. agent_1:Yep. A black man won the first US open tennis title back in 1968 and no black man has won it since. agent_2:Wow! Over 50 years and still holding the record! I think the next year in 1969 they used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the US open. agent_1:I agree. They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US open. agent_2:Yes, they did. The longest tennis match went on for 11 hours over three days. I bet they were exhausted! agent_1:That's crazy long!  agent_2:I agree! It's amazing the facts you can find on Google. Did you know that a single Google search requires more computing power than it took to send Neil Armstrong to the moon? agent_1:That's pretty amazing! I saw that Google maps calculates traffic by how fast Android devices are moving on the road. agent_2:I never knew that! I wonder whose? I know I heard that back in the day Google used goats to keep the lawn under control instead of hiring people to mow. agent_1:That's hilarious! Google went down for 5 minutes back in 2013 and took 40% of the web traffic with it. agent_2:I can imagine. I use it a lot. It's hard to believe its only been around since 1998. agent_1:I agree. When there is a dispute on a border, Google maps tailors the map to the claims of each country where the internet browser is located. agent_2:That sounds logical. I wish I would have gotten on board with the 2004 initial public offering to buy stock. I can't even imagine the outcome. agent_1:I can't either. Do you like shoes?"	agent_2:I love shoes!!

Have you seen it? agent_1:I heard about it. Christopher Robin is the adult version of winnie the pooh right? agent_2:Yeah, that's the one.  Ewan McGregor is Christopher Robin as an adult.  But he ends up going back to the land that Winnie the Pooh and Tiger and all of them live in. agent_1:I think it's plot sounds wonderful for not only children, but also adults to reconnect with their childhoods in a similar manner agent_2:Yeah.  It was pretty nostalgic for me since I used to love Winnie the Pooh as a kid.  It was fun.  I recommend it, if you're interested. agent_1:Sweet. It is too bad the real christopher robin disliked winnie the pooh agent_2:Is that true?  I hadn't heard about that. agent_1:Ya I guess he felt it was too close to his real life and perhaps he would rather have a father than a child's story	agent_2:Wow!  That's really interesting!

That's why they wear the uniforms agent_1:Yeah that is,  considering theres like 20 players on the team,  I think its safe to say the manager can just not suit up lol  agent_2:Haha that's a good point. Do you know what they call kickball in Canada agent_1:I read it but I dont remember lol  agent_2:Haha well they call it soccer-baseball, a very dumb name in my opinion LOL agent_1:maybe they should shorten it to like socball lol  sounds better to me.  agent_2:Lol that does sound a lot better actually. Can you imagine if you found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in your attic. I would probably have a heart attack agent_1:i would go on vacations!

They're the most numerically successful class of tetrapods. agent_1:Ah I gotcha, I was going to say there are some tips to maximize space in the oven during Thanksgiving, but that might just bore both of us haha. That's pretty cool about chickens, there are over 10000 birds that classify as tetrapods. agent_2:I'm sure that some like hummingbirds don't lend themselves to eating, but I know that ostrich steaks are a thing; I wonder how to cook those! I guess they can be so big because they don't fly. agent_1:True, I'm surprised they still have wings. I cannot believe how small hummingbirds are, only 2 inches! agent_2:I guess they're still evolving to the point where the wings disappear. Some birds don't get that chance--the famously extinct dodo bird is actually a sub-family a pigeon that I guess didn't evolve as much as it needed to! agent_1:Interesting, it's funny that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. That is really cool to me. agent_2:That's very resourceful. Some wild birds in Australia are resourceful in mimicking the human world sounds of cameras, car alarms, and chainsaw, although I'm not sure exactly what purpose that would serve. agent_1:I've heard that, they're pretty resourceful. I didn't know how light birds were, their skeleton is hollow and weighs less than the feathers. agent_2:Maybe that's why some birds are able to migrate from Alaska to northern Mexico without sleeping; the light weight must keep them from getting too exhausted. agent_1:That is some cardio! They all have feathers, beaked jaws, lay eggs and have a four chambered heart, I wonder how far they are from dinosaurs. agent_2:Even if they are distantly related, I bet dinosaurs didn't dance the way some birds do to impress their potential mates. They're more closely related to humans in that way. agent_1:I bet not. At least they don't have to worry about having 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week to go through like professional ballet dancers. agent_2:That's a lot, but I guess that kind of dancing is stressful on shoes that are supporting the weight on such as small surface. Did you know that Tupac danced ballet in high school and was even the mouse king in a production of the Nutcracker? agent_1:I never knew that, I did know Bruce Lee was a great dancer that won a dancing championship in 1958. agent_2:That kind of makes sense, since there's so much coordinated movement in both martial arts and dance. It would be more odd if a dancer ended up being a video game pro. agent_1:True, especially if they became a professional Tetris player lol. agent_2:Yes, it is actually one of the three best-selling video games of all time, along with Minecraft and Wii Sports, agent_1:I can't believe it was made in 1984 by Alexy Pajitnov, the government owned the rights to it too.	agent_2:I guess that's a consequence of working for the Soviets.

12954	"agent_1:I don't much like winter, but at least there are no snakes outside.  Carnivorous reptiles can be dangerous if they are poisonous. agent_2:Or you can go to New Zealand where there are no snakes.  I wonder how that happened and none got there accidentally like on plane rides. agent_1:Yeah, you would think over time some would have gotten there.  Even stranger are that there are actually flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey. agent_2:I wonder where those are?  I hope not to see those!  The fear of snakes certainly is hard-wired into not only monkey brains but my brain too! agent_1:I never really knew monkeys were afraid of snakes, but I guess it makes sense.  I wonder if they are also afraid of the legless lizards that aren't snakes.  Sounds similar to me. agent_2:Could be! Did you know that crocodiles are more closely related to birds than snakes and lizards?  I'm not sure how when they look so much like a lizard. agent_1:Agreed, but I remember actually reading that somewhere before.  What I didn't realize though was that their organs were lined up one in front of the other instead of side by side. agent_2:What kind of dancing do you like?  Perhaps the cha-cha like Bruce Lee? agent_1:I'm not much of a fan of dancing.  Went back in college to a nightclub adjoining a liquor store somewhere on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway.  The name escapes me though.     agent_2:There are lots of dance clubs in the cities.  Babies spontaneously dance when they hear music and smile more when they hit the beat.  How cute to see a baby dance! agent_1:Yeah, lots of cute videos of babies dancing.  They usually aren't wearing pointe shoes in those videos.  Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of those in a week. agent_2:Have you seen Disney's new Nutcracker movie?  I didn't get a chance.  But Tupac danced ballet in high school and played the mouse king in a production of nutcracker in high school. agent_1:I have not.  I'm more of a fan of Michael Jackson and his style of dancing.  He actually has a patent on a device to allow him to do that extreme lean. agent_2:Did you ever have a Michael Jackson shirt or glove?  I prefer polo shirts, though. They originally were invented for tennis by Rene ""crocodile"" lacoste and later adopted by polo players.  agent_1:No, was a fan but not that much of a fan.  And certainly wouldn't have been a fan of layering as many shirts as you could like they did in china. agent_2:If you are a fan of khakis, you could fit in at Billy May's funeral as the pallbearers wore blue shirts and khaki's. agent_1:I like Billy mays.  He always cracked me up in his infomericals.  I could see him wearing aloha shirts to work too like they typically do in hawaii instead of suit and ite."	agent_2:Yes, while most in American business are wearing dress shirts like suits and ties, Hawaiians can sport the aloha shirt.  How cool that is!	agent_1 likes fashion. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['fashion', 'family', 'dance'].
4494	agent_1:hey there what do you think of planet earth? agent_2:It's a nice place. I've lived there my whole life. I'm pretty attached. What about you? agent_1:haha ya me too, sad to think that 80% of the natural forests have been destroyed though agent_2:Only 20% more to go! We are a destructive species. Can seem to protect things that we need to survive. And we've been here just a short time. agent_1:thats true, if history were a 24 hour day, humans have only taken up about 1 minute of time agent_2:The day has been getting longer. It was only 5.5 hours. Soon it'll be so long that we'll have a 20-hour workday. I bet people will want more vacation.  agent_1:that is wacky, will the day continue to get longer? like a 40 hour day at somepoint? agent_2:Maybe in billions of years. Humanity will be long gone, having cut down all the forests and filled the oceans with plastic. agent_1:ya that is sad to think about, also sad we'll have run out of helium by the year 2100 agent_2:We'll get our helium from fusion reactors. Every kid can have party balloons. agent_1:haha well I hope so. It's pretty silly there is an ambassador to extraterrestrials at the UN, I want his job	agent_2:I think you have to know somebody. It sounds like it involves few duties. Mostly waiting.	agent_1 dislikes work. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['work', 'hobby', 'fusion reactors'].
236	agent_1:I think its sad to have to part with a pet due to allergies and couple conflict like in the Dear Amy section. agent_2:That is sad. Do you have pets? The first cloned pet was a cat and its name was copy cat. agent_1:Yes, I have a dog.  Sounds like in the Dear Amy that they do everything tit for tat. The cat owner states that her fiance has to get rid of his saltwater fish if she gets rid of her cat.  That's not necessarily fair though I don't think.  They seem like they may struggle as a couple in the future. agent_2:Yeah that's a bit dramatic! A cat lover is known as an ailurophile and a dog lover is known as a cynophile. agent_1:Allergies can be serious to people.  I understand his reserve of having a cat. agent_2:Me too. A pet or companion animal is an animal kept primarily for a person's company, protection, or entertainment. No one should have to be made uncomfortable by a pet in the house.	agent_1:I'm sure she loves the pet, but she has to make a choice if the pet is harming her fiance.	agent_2 likes pets. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['pets', 'cat', 'pets'].
7508	agent_1:hi, do you know much about planet earth? agent_2:I know that 80 percent of our forests have already been destroyed agent_1:yeah and that is so sad. did you know the day used to be 5.5 hours only ? agent_2:It is really sad considering that humans have only been here a minute if earth's history was viewed as a 24 hour period. I did not know that about the day being so short agent_1:Yeah when you think about it it makes it ever sadder to what we are doing to this planet agent_2:Well, the UN has appointed an official ambassador to extraterrestrials so hopefully we make some alien friends soon so we can move planets.  agent_1:haha, that would be kind of cool. apparently earth will be helium free by the end of this century agent_2:No more helium balloons? Aww... agent_1:I know, but maybe it is for the better. do you like animals agent_2:I don't really like them as pets but in nature yes. It's sad that the dodo bird is extinct. I hope we stop destroying the earth and habitats for animals. The dodo bird was actually a sub family of pigeon. agent_1:Yeah and I think it was a nice looking bird. I hope so too. their bones are lighter than their feathers agent_2:Yeah, this is due to their bones being hollow. agent_1:yeah, I guess that makes sense for them since they need to fly agent_2:Right. I think wild birds in Australia are neat but would probably drive me insane. They can mimic camera, car alarms, and chainsaw sounds. agent_1:hahaha I can imagine that, going out everytime to check if the car is alright agent_2:Another neat thing to observe would be a hummingbird stealing a spiderweb's nest! agent_1:they are so tiny and yet so smart	agent_2:Sorry, I meant stealing webs to repair their nests. Yeah, bird brains are tiny but they seem so intelligent!	agent_1 likes botany. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['botany', 'planet earth', 'music'].

How about you? agent_1:I also love animals,  I have a dog,  but Ive been asking my husband for a dragon for years agent_2:I don't think he'll be able to find that. Out of the 20 quintillion animal types on the planet, I don't think dragon's exist. agent_1:well not the ones I want.  But they do exist,  the kimodo dragon.  agent_2:Oh that's right. I forgot those little guys are still around. Did you know Germany is the first country in the world to give animals legal rights? agent_1:Yeah I think the kimodo dragon actually has its own island too lol I didnt know that,  what rights are those? agent_2:Yes, I think the do have an island. As for the legal rights, I'm not entirely sure but pretty much what humans have. agent_1:I see.  Did you know dogs have 12 blood types?   agent_2:No, I had no idea. That is interesting. Did you know animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated? agent_1:Is that every animal?  I never seen it on any of my dogs or fish.  That is interesting.  agent_2:Yes, my animals have those patches. I think it's all the head pats. agent_1:lol what kind of animals do you have? agent_2:I have two cats. They are rescues, really good cats but they seems to hate the movie Frozen. Did you know that was the first Disney film directed by a woman? agent_1:Nice,  my dog is a rescue.  I wonder why they hate frozen,  it has such good songs.  No I didnt know that.  agent_2:I don't know but they literally growl at the TV when its on. I guess they aren't Disney fans. I wonder if they would like the lion king. agent_1:Yeah show them something they might relate to,  cats.  did you know that wreck it ralph developement started in the 1980s,  took so long to get that movie finish,  turned out great though.  agent_2:I had no idea, that is a long time of development. I was also surprised to find out the lion king was the first Disney film to be dubbed in Zulu for its African release. agent_1:Thats good,  they should make it dubbed in more languages. 	agent_2:Yeah, they are trying to sell to a big audience. I mean toy industries are involved with Disney animations before they begin making the films.	agent_1 likes movie. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'hobby', 'pets'].
9133	agent_1:hi how are you? do you like mars? it is a planet, one of many. agent_2:I think Mars is fascinating! agent_1:mars really is a killer planet. it is red, red as all get out. plus it is associated with war. that is cool. agent_2:It gets its name from the God of War.   agent_1:that is the coolest god of them all. i would like to get that job. mars is the fourth planet from the sun but it is tops in my book. it might seem small but it is huge to me. would you want to live there? agent_2:Maybe, I hear there is a colonization project planned for 2023 agent_1:yes, i want to see who goes there and how much they get paid. it is a crazy job i think.	agent_2:Agreed.

Me and my son like watching stff like that he loves dinosars. agent_1:My son too, he keeps telling me when the new Jurassic movies are coming out, 2020 apparently. agent_2:Thats awesome. I hadnt heard abot a new one. Fnny thing about Speilberg. When he rode the jurassic park ride he asked to be let off before the 84 foot drop. I can nderstand what he is going through there thogh. Im not a big rollercoaster fan. agent_1:Same here.  My son loves Cedar Point in Ohio, we take him and he goes on all the big rides while I sit and watch.  I guess everyone seeks their own entertainment. agent_2:Yeah I went on a roller coaster when i was little that did a flip. Then it went backwards and did the flip again. I have hated them ever sense. 	agent_1:I think I'll stick to the movies.  Have you ever seen the movie Moon?

5169	agent_1:Do you follow baseball? agent_2:Yes. I am a dodger fan agent_1:Awesome!  I like Walker Buehler.  What do you think of the Dodgers/Reds trade?  Think it was a good one?   agent_2:No. They gave up too much. Puig was a pain in the neck, but one of the best defensive left fielders in baseball. The pitcher wood was a young guy who was an all star 2 years ago agent_1:I was kind of surprised when they did that trade.  Did you know baseball managers wear uniforms because they can technically play if needed? agent_2:Yes. I remember Pete Rose and Frank Robinson doing that agent_1:Yes.  How about the guy who found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards that were hidden in his grandfathers attic since the 1940s.  I'm not ashamed to admit that I still a few packs of baseball cards every year.  It gives me the thrill I had when I was kid opening them. agent_2:Yes my base baseball cards were thrown out many many years ago. I wish I had those back agent_1:They were super huge there in the late 80s and early 90s but have died down in popularity since then.  Did you know kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada? agent_2:Yes. I had heard that before. agent_1:I don't know if I would like to schedule the games.  For 24 years a married couple scheduled all MLB games played each year. agent_2:That sounds like a heck of a big job. agent_1:I would want no part of it.  Babe Ruth was thrown out stealing to end game 7 and lose the 1926 world series.  First time I've ever seen that fact. agent_2:I have never heard that before.  agent_1:First time for me as well.  Did you know that baseball is really popular in Japan and many fans there are surprised to find out it's known as America's national pastime? agent_2:Yes. Baseball has been big in Japan for a long time agent_1:I find it interesting how they name the teams.  Surprised we don't see that here.  We could see the Walmart Cashiers playing the Target Bullseyes. lol agent_2:The  Dodgers are called the Dodgers because their fans in Brooklyn Had to Dodge trollys to get to the Stadium. They were called trolly Dodgers, Then shortened to Brooklyn Dodgers	agent_1:That is interesting!  I honestly never knew that!    The womens cup had higher tv ratings than the world series in the US.

I remember going to the theater to see it. agent_2:No, I did not.  My son went with his friends. Apparently, Star Wars was dubbed in Navajo in 2013. agent_1:There must have been a big enough market for them to do that.  They have the money to do it that's for sure.  Just the box office alone the Star Wars franchise has brought in over $8.5 billion dollars! agent_2:20th Century Fox did not think that Star Wars was going to succeed.  Do you know what happened to Star Wars' licensing and merchandising rights? agent_1:Didn't George Lucas get them somehow? agent_2:Yes, because they did not want to pay additional directing fee to Lucas.  agent_1:Nice.  He scored then big time because the entire Star Wars franchise is estimated to $65 billion dollars! agent_2:20th Century Fox avoided to pay additional fee of only $500k to Lucas.  They were willing to give the licensing and merchandising to him.  Someone got fired at the company, I'll bet. agent_1:You know it!  George Lucas' wife Marcia won an academy award for editing the film!	agent_2:I heard about it.  She was talented.

1560	"agent_1:Many people like to watch horror films, I don't like slashers but like some like World War Z, did you know the horror film genre has been around for more than a century? agent_2:oh yes, I even watched the first ""Nosferatu"" movie - not sure when that was made but it's quite old... agent_1:That one is a  classic, based on the book by Bram Stoker.  They say if you watch a horror movie you will enjoy abstract art more, maybe because they are both a horror? agent_2:I always loved horror movies... they work good on Your imagination ;) agent_1:They are good for your health as well, guess why?"	agent_2:Horrors good for Your health ?

10536	"agent_1:Hello there, do you use Amazon much? agent_2:Hey yeah I love Amazon use it all the time! Hard to believe amazon workers walk between 7 and 15 miles each day. agent_1:Yeah I use it quite a bit myself, and it is hard to believe, I would think no more than 2 or 3.  agent_2:Yea that seems more accurate. Also I was interested to know IMDB is owned by Amazon.  agent_1:Yeah I didn't know that about them, I wonder how many other things they own? agent_2:Yeah good question. I respect Bezos though. He built the largest internet retailer in the world all the way back in 1994. agent_1:Yeah Bezos is a great businessman.  Did you know he built a clock into a mountain that will run for 10,000 years? agent_2:Whoa I would like to see that. The Amazon contract with USPS must explain how they are able to deliver packages so fast, even on Sundays! agent_1:Yeah I wonder how the postal employees felt when they learned that Sundays are no longer off days for all.  agent_2:Yeah I bet that didn't go over so well. But only a matter of time until Artificial Intelligence will start delivering for Amazon. There is even a non profit organization for the advancement of AI. agent_1:I think I read that, I wonder who funds that kind of organization? agent_2:Yeah good question I'm not sure. AI is definitely good at solving puzzles though as it crushed all human records in the puzzle game ""2048"".  agent_1:That is pretty impressive, did you know the actress Kristen Stewart once co-authored a paper on AI? agent_2:I didn't take that actress for the scientific type. I would like to attend one of Stanford's free AI classes. agent_1:Yeah same here, I think that would be very interesting to sit in on a class or two.  agent_2:Very much so! I just hope machines don't become so capable that they start to perform things without commands!"	agent_1:Yeah and that is where it starts to get scary, especially if we give them a lot of control. 	agent_2 likes technology. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['technology', 'foundation', 'finance'].

Would you believe it if I told you that the Chicago Cubs last won a World Series when the Ottoman Empire was still in existence? agent_1:am... no, I don't think I would believe that... ;) was that in Wikipedia ? ;) lol agent_2:Maybe a saved version of wikipedia.  I won't soon forget when the Cubs really did win, back in 2016, over my Indians. agent_1:Your ? ;)  at that time You were cheering for Indians ? agent_2:Yes.  I'm not the owner of the team ;) ... they're just from my hometown. agent_1:Although I'm Polish - I got that ;) lol. How are they doing these days ? agent_2:Pretty good, on top of their division last year, but no where as good as the Red Sox.  They had an amazing start to the year, and then they won the World Series. agent_1:Holy crap, nice. Probably fat bonuses for everybody... but hey... if they made their fans happy, why the heck not... they earned it ! agent_2:They did.  It was almost too easy.  They have great pitchers, good hitters, and a new manager.  Normally, a new manager isn't a help, but he was from the team who won the World Series the year before, The Houston Astros. agent_1:Huh... do You think he knows a secret for winning World Series ? ;)  idk... I think it's just a well paid team ;) agent_2:Money and chemistry build winning teams, if you ask me.  Baseball is popular in the US, Japan, and a few other places.  Is it played much in Poland? agent_1:Not really, but we do buy baseball bats :) to go watch soccer games on a stadium :) agent_2:You buy bats?  Why?  I used to collect baseball cards, which can be quite valuable! agent_1:well... when one soccer team meets other soccer team and those two towns/teams are not friendly... You need to take whatever You can smuggle to the stadium to fight off the hooligans from the other team ;) lol - baseball bats are selling good in Poland but nobody plays the game ;) lol agent_2:ah ... that's a little scary.  I suppose without a baseball bat, my simple weapon of choice would be  ...  something else I can't think of.  Fascinating.  I do like soccer.  I'm a Croat (half really), so the World Cup was exciting this year.  Unfortunately, only the women's world cup is more popular in the US than the baseball world series. agent_1:Croatia won out hearts this Worldcup - seriously - great job guys   ! It was a pleasure to watch Your matches ! agent_2:Do you think Modric was really the best player in the tournament? agent_1:In the entire tournament? Maybe not the actual best, but he showed a lot of passion for sure ! agent_2:Fair enough.  Do you think soccer coaches are important to the winning of a team, like they are in baseball? agent_1:they sure are, but these days with so much primadonnas in the team, I think they have a tough job to do...	agent_2:Yes, I get the impression that soccer players are paid very much.

Apparently publishers were not a fan when it was first being sent out for publication.  agent_2:Interesting. There is a university where you can study science fiction and fantasy literature with a concentration in Tolkien studies. agent_1:That would be an amazing class! I think there is so much to be learned from those great books.  agent_2:I think so too. Jim Henson created The Dark Crystal with the idea that it was unhealthy for children never to be afraid. agent_1:Hmm I could see that being true. If children have no fear then they are liable to get into anything. Healthy fear isn't a bad thing.  agent_2:I agree. Do you like Walt Disney? agent_1:I like some of their stuff. A few things are a bit underhandedly political for my taste but most is good. You? agent_2:Yep, I like Walt Disney. The Disney channel doesn't accept outside ads. Did you know that? agent_1:I didn't know that. Makes sense though because then they can direct traffic toward their products and shows.  agent_2:Yep I agree. Walt Disney and Salvador Dali once collaborated on a short film. agent_1:That is awesome. i think my favorie disney film would have to be either big hero 6 or the incredibles.  agent_2:Yea those are both good ones. Disney makes $1,110 per second. agent_1:Wow that is just a insane amount of money. Hopefully they are doing some good work with all that cash.  agent_2:I bet they are.

We are running out of so many things on this earth. Did you know 80 percent of forests have been destroyed? agent_2:thats a sad thing to hear. but we still have a bunch, so imagine how many we used to have! agent_1:I couldn't imagine! I wonder if that's why some birds fly from Alaska to Mexico without sleeping? agent_2:they have to get to the warm, and fast! they must get tired making the long journey tho agent_1:I'm sure they sleep for days haha. Birds are pretty smart. There are wilds birds in Australia that can mimic the sound of cameras, car alarms, and chainsaws. agent_2:That's so funny. I wonder what their accents are like. Because birds have accents! agent_1:I'm picturing british and american birds talking to each other lol. I would like to see that, but also hang out with cats in Taiwan. agent_2:id love to hear a bird with a cockneyed British accent. do you like cats? agent_1:No I actually don't really like cats lol, but you can hang out with them at a cafe in Taiwan.

Did you also know that dogs are not color blind like most people think? agent_2:Yeah, I heard that they can see colors, not as well as we do but still in color agent_1:They also, along with elephants, are the only two animals the seem to understand pointing by instincts.  agent_2:They are definitely mart animals.  That might by Google prefers them to cats. agent_1:That is so weird, and I guess they came out and declared they were a dog company.  agent_2:Yeah.

The Republican party is old school so it fits very nicely! agent_1:There have been a total of 19 Republican presidents...the most of any party! agent_2:Wow, I didn't know that. Yes, the Republicans dominated politics nationally between 1860 and 1932!  agent_1:They always emphasize their abortion position, which all stemmed from the monumental Roe vs Wade 1973 Supreme Court Ruling. agent_2:Exactly. This was their platform and their support grew its evangelicals, leading to complete alignment with Christian conservatism. A lot different from the Democratic party.	agent_1:Yes a stark contrast to the Democrats.

9576	agent_1:Hello, do you like Astronomy? agent_2:I do, but do not follow it closely.  I did have the good fortune of seeing the 2012 annular eclipse when I was on a consulting assignment in Utah.  And you? agent_1:I also enjoy it when I can.  A while ago, ancient babylonians understood astronomy so well, they were able to track planets with mathematical precision!  agent_2:Its amazing that they were able to do that without the modern optics and computers we have today.  It seems the interest in astronomy is so great that even the Vatican has an observatory!  agent_1:I went to the Vatican a few years ago, and did not know that!  Wi-fi was actually a byproduct of research into improving astronomy imagery. agent_2:I doubt the younger generation would know how to live without WiFi.  They seem to live their life on the internet via social media.  Did you know that Finland has made access to the internet a human right? agent_1:I did not know it is a right in Finland! I agree with too much reliance now.  I don't know how many will need this, but there is 3g service and internet capabilities at the peak of mount everest.  So you can take the selfie up there before passing out.   agent_2:LOL.  What amazes me is how people assume they can do anything, even on their employer's internet!  Did you happen to hear about the criminal investigation that shut down the Sunspot Observatory in NM? agent_1:I remember when that was going on, didn't hear too much why initially.  I know there were theories of Aliens? agent_2:Well, it was not E.T downloading illegal materials; it was the janitor!  I am glad the facility director got the FBI involved. agent_1:Definitely glad the FBI got involved!  That janitor claimed someone been entering there to steal their internet service!  Lol I don't think E.T would stop there now! agent_2:Thankfully that is over and the observatory is back up and running.  And, I hope they have upgraded their internet security!  Do you think there is life out there that we do not yet know about?	agent_1:I do think how vast the galaxies are, that there has to be life somewhere else!

Are you a big user of Netflix? agent_1:I am a big user, I have an account and use it almost every day, mostly after 9pm, what about you? agent_2:No I don't have an account currently.  So you are one of those that make up using all that bandwidth during peak hours lol.  agent_1:I am a part of that group, yes, lol, its also YouTubes fault as they together with netflix they take upon half of the internet traffic agent_2:Yeah I can totally see that, YouTube is so popular among younger people it's crazy to me.  agent_1:It is really popular, just like Netflix is, its amazing how the service has 137 million subscribers around the globe agent_2:And that number is still growing, thats so many.  But, it is quality stuff, you get access to an insane amount of content.  agent_1:I agree, you get more than what you pay for, I used to spend a lot of money on rentals and those late fees were a real pain to pay agent_2:Yeah I think that is why Hastings started the company in the first place, he was in your same shoes.  agent_1:Could be, so he must hate Star Wars then, do you like the franchise? agent_2:Yeah I grew up watching the movies years ago when I was a kid, I still think the ones from the late 70's/early 80's are the best ones.  How about you? agent_1:I do too, I think old movies are the best ones, I love Star Wars personally, I dont like the new movies as much though,  agent_2:Yeah I'm the same way when it comes to that.  It is hard to replicate, and I know the Star Wars fans are so hardcore and hard to please as well! agent_1:Yeah I agree with you, its amazing how much the franchise is worth though, 65 billion dollars!! agent_2:Yeah that is an insane amount.  I wonder how much it was worth back in the 1990's?	agent_1:I bet not much, at least at the beggining 20th Century Fox didnt have much faith in the movie, that lack of faith cost them millions	agent_2 dislikes movie. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'movie review', 'social media'].

I didn't know that. back in 1936 some russians actually made a computer that ran on water....how strange is that. agent_2:Really strange, I wonder what happened to that model? maybe water wasnt the best choice.  agent_1:Right! I don't even know how that would work. Very interesting though, also I read someone built a 16 bit computer using nothing but Minecraft building blocks, so crazy how these people get these idea's. agent_2:I know agent_1:So do you like the piano?  agent_2:I accidentally hit the enter tab, I was going to say I know, the world is full with creativity, and I do like the piano I like the sound of it. agent_1:Me too, I did play years ago but not anymore. I love the soothing sound of it. years ago the bbc didn't have any news worth reporting so the just played piano music lol that's awesome. agent_2:That odd considering the news giant BBC is today! did you know that Freddy Mercury played the same piano as Paul McCartney agent_1:My thoughts exactly! Oh wow that's an interesting fact! They built a piano for the Hindenburg and it only weighed over 300 pounds, who would think of putting a piano on that airship! agent_2:That takes some useful weight out of the plane, and maybe someone that is a real piano fan, would be nice to listen to it in the sky though. agent_1:Very true. Piano music is great no matter where you are. It is like poetry to your ears, which I love too.

Did you know under provisions of the 1912 Scottish protection of animals act the lochness monster is a protected species? hahaha agent_2:That's funny!  The Netherlands is constructing special bridges for wildlife in order to connect habitats and keep animals from being hit by cars.  That's a good idea.  In the fall where I live the roads are peppered with dead animals.  I think they try to get on the roads to get warm at night and that's when they get hit. agent_1:Intriguing! Crazy that humans have lost their body hair 240,000 years ago. agent_2:Interesting. lol  There's a lawyer in Switzerland who represents animals in court.  That's a different kind of lawyer job. agent_1:So weird. I would sue humans if I were an animal. agent_2:lol  yes.  They sure have gotten the short end of the stick that's for sure.

The nokia company originally got big by making rubber boots. in the 1800's. they still make rubber boots. agent_2:i had no idea. you can put tea bags in stinky shoes to absorb the smell agent_1:Ive actually tried this with my snowboarding boots it works great!  agent_2:thats a neat trick and I might have to try it! although I missed the part about dry my thought was wet and that it would make your shoes wet. lol did you know 500 year old shoes out perform todays shoes agent_1:I wonder in what way?  I know they were custom before.  The phrase ""pulling oneself up by their bootstraps"" originally meant ""doing something that is pretty much impossible"". agent_2:Maybe because shoes used to be designed for function and not fashion agent_1:In 1838, a man stopped on the boulevard du temple in paris to get his boots cleaned. he and the cleaner stood still for at least seven minutes on the street, and accidentally became the first people in history to be photographed. agent_2:I wonder how they accidentally became photographed? agent_1:No clue,  right place right time.  Maybe he was in the background or something.

In 2008 the norwegian government donated $1bn to help save the amazon rainforest. agent_2:I am pretty sure that was money not well spent since we always here about deforestation.  gov't is supposed to be the balance between individual freedom and  tyranny...somebody should tell the US government that"	agent_1:In 2006, the us passed legislation that would protect government employees from being prosecuted for violating the geneva conventions	agent_2 likes world war ii. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['world war ii', 'holiday', 'christmas market'].

In fact, one of its moons (Ganymede) would actually be considered a planet if it orbited the sun. agent_1:That is pretty cool. And Venus does not tilt hence it only has one season agent_2:Thats kind of similar to Uranus as well.

There are people out there going to bed without food.  agent_1:I really dislike that whole Kardashian family. I think  it is ridiculous how much money they make and they dont really seem to earn it.

Just revealing their 3 rd child's name - Chicago blew up social media.  agent_1:Yeah it's crazy,  and all their businesses are completely run by other people.

Are pets also used in their meals? agent_1:I don't know.  The emperor of Japan is a scientist and publishes papers.

I guess comedy central has not been doing great,  It has cancelled over  shows! agent_2:That or they're picky.  Bill Murray isn't so picky.

That is crazy. agent_2:ahhh, I did not get that. So he came it legally ? and he couldn't marry white woman ? Was that a law ? What year was that ?? agent_1:His marriage did not become legal until 1948, prior to that it was considered illegal.  No woman has every been nominated for best cinematography Oscars either, so I guess there are still some issues. agent_2:There will always be issues with race... but we're getting there... agent_1:I like the fantasy escape from all of our problems we find at the box office.

I loved it when I was a kid, but since they've destroyed Star Wars... they're dead to me ;) agent_1:I prefer the original 3 from my childhood in the 70's.  Hopefully they learn something from their flops like Treasure planet, not that was a waste of money. agent_2:yes. just because its Disney and it has to be ok for kids ? make a division for adults and start making decent movies... You have the budget, technicians... nothing would stop them... agent_1:I think they have a separate division but can't remember what it is called.

No I mean make movies like Star Wars for a little bit mature audience... don't focus on 6year olds because there are millions of 60 year old wanted to see how the story continues... agent_1:We never get to see the rebuilding of the galaxy and having Leia and Han's son kill Han and be bad was a stupid thing to do. agent_2:it was a poor choice yes. and the way they showed Luke was not to my liking either... agent_1:They made him seem like he regressed into some kind of whiney baby, at his age and experience he should be evolving more like Ben Kenobi or even Yoda, not woah is me I need a xanex Luke agent_2:That's my point exactly ! He was Vader's son ! Son of a person born out of force.. in my mind, he should be leading everybody to defeat Siths OR maybe share the faith of his father and go the the dark side... but not this... agent_1:It was so frustrating and annoying.  Vader's turn to the bright side at the end should have affirmed him and gave him deterination to continue, and why have Han's son be so bad, that is just pointless,  I guess they couldn't think of a bad guy. agent_2:I think they are preparing a twist of action nobody is suspecting but I think it's in a bad taste.

Jim Henson created The Dark Crystal with the idea that it was unhealthy for children never to be afraid. agent_1:Hmm I could see that being true.

I know that Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fictino. agent_1:I'm not a huge fan to be honest. 	agent_2:Hhaha I was when I was little more than I am now.

13667	"agent_1:Hello, are you a Tupac fan? I am and wasn't aware he was a ballet dancer in High school agent_2:I'm not the biggest fan of rap, admittedly, but I do like some of his work.  Neat that he was a ballet dancer.  Speaking of ballet dancers, I'm told they go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a WEEK.  Talk about being on your toes! agent_1:They sure do! Michael Jackson had specially made shoes for some of his own dance moves. agent_2:Wonder if that how he was able to do that ""extreme lean"" move he does.  (I'm told he owns a patent on the device, but dunno if the device is shoes or something else...)  Did you know Bruce Lee was also a great dancer? agent_1:He won the Hong Kong Cha-Cha in 1958. my kids do the cha cha slide in Call of Duty. agent_2:Hehe. That's funny.  Speaking of kids, they say even babies spontaneously dance when they hear music.  I saw a youtube video once of a baby jamming out to Gangnum Style by Psy.  LOL agent_1:That is cute when they do that. I didn't know that moon dust is so sharp, it can cut through kevlar. agent_2:Not just that, but they say it can give you ""Moon Hay Fever"".  Had no idea there was moon hay fever... that just sounds both scary and nutty...  agent_1:Yeah, it does. I can't believe NASA thought about placing a UN flag on the moon, instead of the American flag. agent_2:Ahhh... forget that!  As far as I know, the UN didn't help the US get to the moon.  Grrr... don't get started on the subject of the UN, trying to watch my blood pressure!  :)  Speaking of moons, did you know Phobos (Mars' moon) is one third hollow?   agent_1:I've always wondered how they know things like this. Especially when you think that they once thought it was hollow. agent_2:That I can't tell ya.. it's just amazing all the stuff they've been able to discover just by telescopes and pictures.  Heck, they believe there's evidence of methane based life on Satan's moon, Titan.  That'd be pretty amazing if they can confirm it! agent_1:If they were smart, they would stay hidden. Oddly, an aluminum grand piano was built for the Hindenburg. I wonder how it sounded? agent_2:That's a good question, dunno if making it out of aluminum would make it sound different or not.  Like with violins.  There's a noticeable difference in sound with them depending on the type of wood used... agent_1:I don't know much about them, as neither of my kids play piano. It's interesting that Freddie Mercury and Paul McCartney used the same piano to record songs on agent_2:That'd probably make it one of the most valuable piano's ever (if it was up for sale, that is.)  Speaking of piano, did you know there's a song designed for stress testing auto-pianos?  It's called Circus Galop.  You can hear it on Youtube if you're interested... agent_1:I did not. I wonder how a piano got to the top of Britains highest mountain? agent_2:My guess?  Pranksters!  LOL.  I mean, seriously, who looks at a huge mountain, and says, ""Hey, lets get a piano up there!""   agent_1:That sounds very difficult. I've hiked the AT, and have left water behind, because it added too much weight. The BBC once decided there was nothing worth reporting, so they broadcast piano music instead. agent_2:The AT?  What's that?  Must have been a REAL slow news day.  Way the news is today I think sometimes I'd rather listen to piano music instead! agent_1:I know I would. Thank you for chatting with me today, have a wonderful day. agent_2:Hey, you too!

What about you? agent_2:i dont like snakes but i dont hate. they are to be respected. they are part of nature agent_1:There is a genus of flying snakes! Nope! agent_2:That would be a hard no for me too. dang nature why you so scary LOL Crocodiles are more closely related to birds than they are to snakes and lizards. i guess i could move to australia agent_1:Australia's got crazy too! I remember a story of huge birds dropping dead out of the sky. Or maybe they were bats. Anyways, huge flying things falling from the sky! agent_2:yeah, lots of scary things there. crocodiles are pretty scary, but they are not related snakes LOL agent_1:Humans are not the only ones afraid of snakes. Monekys are too! agent_2:monkeys are smart, they know what is dangerous! i bet a lot of creatures are afraid  of snakes. agent_1:I wonder if they can tell the difference between snakes and legless lizards. agent_2:i bet they dont care. they fear anything that is close. i know i would! by the way, do you go to concerts much? agent_1:I do. Do you go to concerts much? agent_2:I used to go quite a bit when i was younger. now i dont really go. no time or money.  agent_1:I do not like the crowds any more. I like smaller venues and local music. agent_2:i dont like crowds either. not very intimate. i do like sitting near the stage and seeing the musicians up close. agent_1:I am more of a bar guy at the bar, just listening and relaxing. agent_2:yeah, i hear you. music to unwind. not dealing with crowds and hassles. would you ever sue a band for a bad performance? i wonder how mad i would have to be. agent_1:Are you talking about Creed? I remember that on the news and I laughed out loud because that is something I can see scott stapp doing. agent_2:they must have sucked incredibly to drive people to a lawsuit. they probably should have practiced a bit before touring. agent_1:He got stupid drunk before the show, passed out after 15 minutes, and then the show ended. Once he was sued, he called it performance art. Such a waste... agent_2:thats terrible. the guy has a drinking problem and needs help. Anyway, great chat!	agent_1:Ditto!

I wonder how the surfer would fare with 5,000 year old shoes.  agent_2:They would probably make them into sandals and put dry tea bags in them to remove the smell.  agent_1:Ah, yes, but what kind of tea? Free-range organic tea? NFL player Steve Smith leaves his cleats on the field after every game. He hopes to raise awareness of homeless people without shoes. I bet he doesn't put tea in his shoes. agent_2:I bet they get stolen.  So many of these rich football people and their ""caring.""  The need to put their money where their mouth is like Norway.  They gave $1B to save Amazon rain forests. "	agent_1: I wish the US gov’t would do something like that.The US gov’t owns 86% of the land in Nevada.

1184	agent_1:Did you ever watch ET? agent_2:Yes, I did.  It was the movie when I was a kid! agent_1:Seems like Steven Spielberg is trying to return to his glory with Ready Player One. Have you seen that? agent_2:No, I haven't see it.  Have you? agent_1:I have't either. At the premiere screening the sound cut out. But instead of booing, the audience member cheers and makes their own sound effects. agent_2:Well that was sure nice of them to do that, I'm sure Spielberg appreciated it! agent_1:Right, usually that would be embarrassment. That was cool of the audience. Ready Player One is another childlike adventure where virtual reality dominates. agent_2:It sounds cool, my grandkids would probably like it.  I remember when I first saw Jaws, it scared me to death!	agent_1:Yeah, I know what you mean. Ready Player one takes place on an Earth where people go to VR to escape their real life problems.

12348	agent_1:hi,  do you like animals?  did you know the loch ness monster is a protected species?  agent_2:I did not know that. That will come in handy once we find one. Also,Germany was the first country in the world to universally give animals legal rights that were constitutionally guaranteed. This was in 2002. agent_1:Sweet!  hmmm domesticated animals develop a white patch,  I wonder if that is only towards horses or all animals.  agent_2:Yeah, I wonder if that occurs naturally or because of how they are bred. agent_1:Maybe.  I know Orcas dorsal fin tends to flop over in captivity but it the wild the dorsal fin it straight up.  agent_2:Interesting. There are so many things to learn about animals, especially knowing that there are 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth. agent_1:i wonder how many zeroes are in a quintillion lol That is a lot of animals!  i love the discovery channel I watch a lot of animal shows.   Did you know theres a breed of horse that has a fifth speed?  I guess it is called a tolt.  agent_2:I heard a tolt is speedwalking for a horse. That's pretty funny! agent_1:That is cool,  horses got places to go!  speed walking is helpful.  agent_2:I can't imagine being allergic to horses. I would be devastated. Apparently Clint Eastwood developed an allergy to them although he has been on horseback in many of his movies. agent_1:Yeah I know right,  hes in so many western movies,  I guess he had to take daily claritin for his allergies!   agent_2:Haha. I am glad we get to use horses for leisure these days or for recording movies, haha. Historically they were used in warfare. agent_1:did you hear about the lipizzaner horses?  They are born a dark color and later turn white?  Thats amazing!	agent_2:That's totally weird. I had not heard about that.

How about you? agent_1:I love Google, i can't stand other search engines like bing or yahoo agent_2:I refuse to use Bing because I despise Microsoft even more than Google.  agent_1:lol, Google is incredible though, it requires more computing power for one search than it took to send neil armstrong to the moon! agent_2:Yeah, pretty much any kind of personal electronic device these days would put the supercomputers of that period to shame. agent_1:that is very true, a lot has come since back then. How about siri, are you a fan? agent_2:I don't even have a smart phone, so I've never used it. Have you? agent_1:wow, you are daring, i like it! I have an iphone but never use siri, I would rather just google something instead to be honest. agent_2:I'm not really daring, LOL. I just live in a 3G dead zone and I'm self-employed, so I just need a basic tracfone in case I have an emergency on my occasional trips to town. But my laptop is all the Internet connection I need. agent_1:I have a friend like that also, no shame in that. That is perfect though with your laptop because you can still communicate with others if needed. Do you do a lot of amazon shopping? agent_2:A fair amount, although they're another corporation I hate :) I get better deals on supplements and used books. How about you? agent_1:For sure, it was started as a book company in 1994 agent_2:They're a good source of out-of-print stuff, for sure. Library Genesis is also good for obtaining ""unauthorized"" pdfs of a whole lot of books. I always check there before Amazon. agent_1:I will have to check that out, is that legal to use? I am taking my masters and books cost too much agent_2:The uploads are probably copyright violations, but I've never heard of anybody having trouble over downloading from it. And any academic book you want there's a better than 90% chance you'll find it there. Just Google ""Library Genesis"" to find mirror sites.  agent_1:wow, I will do that, thank you! Back to amazon though, jeff bezos has a clock in a mountain that will run for 10,000, i wonder why agent_2:It sounds a lot like something called the Long Now Project that did something similar, IIRC. agent_1:I will have to look into that, that sounds interesting.

I think the album is actually called Man in the Woods. I don't think it was as good as his earlier stuff. I only really remember Say Something from this new album. agent_1:Yeah. Well I think it's safe to say he has come a long way since Mickey Mouse Club! agent_2:Have you seen any of the movies he's been in? agent_1:Yeah I saw the one about facebook which I thought was good. He is a good actor but I think he should stick to pop music. Ricky Gervais was a pop singer oddly enough. agent_2:I can't remember the name of the movie I saw him but Cameron Diaz and Jason Segal were in it too. It was pretty good. I can't imagine Ricky Gervais singing at all! He's hilarious though. agent_1:Oh yeah I remember that movie too. Like a rom-com. Yes he is. I want to look up his video lol. Wonder if he played the guitar? agent_2:Haha I don't think so. His voices doesn't sound like it would translate to a singing voice at all. Although doesn't his character in The Office sing? agent_1:Haha occasionally yes but not well. I just watched the movie about queen. The guitarist, Brian May, has a phd in astrophysics.	agent_2:I haven't seen that movie, but that band was incredibly talented.

The country is a crazy place lately.  agent_1:I agree. There hasn't been a US president who wasn't a rep or dem since 1853. agent_2:Wow, I guess that doesn't surprise me lol. Did you know the use of RED and BLUE for each party color only began in 2000? Weird agent_1:Oh wow I didn't know that. I saw that Ronald Reagan compaiged for democrats. agent_2:That's odd, he wasn't a Democrat, interesting. i didn't know that. agent_1:Very interesting I think. 15% of the tea party movement identify themselves as democrats.	agent_2:Interesting!

The New York Yankees have a lost player....never found!

Did you know kickball is considered a type of baseball in Canada? Interesting!  agent_1:That is interesting! Baseball is so popular in Japan that many fans are suprised to know it is considered Americas national pastime agent_2:That's funny, it has always been America's favorite pastime! I wonder if they take Baseball as serious as American's do lol, or if they watch the world series as well. agent_1:I have no clue... so you are a yankees fan agent_2:Yes, they are a very interesting team.

What baseball city you like? agent_2:I'm a Nationals fan. It seems like the Astros made a splashy move by not having to commit tens of millions of dollars in annual salary well into the next decade.  agent_1:I hear ya....do you think Gerrit Cole is worth all the effort to get him? agent_2:I'm not sure, probably not, but let's see. Did you know that the managers wear uniforms because they technically are allowed to play?  agent_1:I never new the managers could also play. Can't remember that happening in ages. I always sort of liked Justin Verlander when he was with the Tigers. The Indians always kicked his butt. agent_2:Yeah. The Nationals have Bryce Harper, he had a bad year last year, but he is still very highly paid.  agent_1:Very true. I was rooting for the Nationals last year, but man they hit the wall late in the baseball season. What happened? agent_2:It happens all the time. Crazy, they just can't close the deal.  agent_1:That sounds an awful like the Indians. I'm 61 years old and have never seen them in a World Series. I'm beginning to think I never will. agent_2:Crazy.

The cat owner states that her fiance has to get rid of his saltwater fish if she gets rid of her cat.  That's not necessarily fair though I don't think.  They seem like they may struggle as a couple in the future. agent_2:Yeah that's a bit dramatic! A cat lover is known as an ailurophile and a dog lover is known as a cynophile. agent_1:Allergies can be serious to people.  I understand his reserve of having a cat.	agent_2:Me too.

That must be really fun to watch. I was always a fan of Michael Jackson's dancing.  agent_2:He was a legend in dancing! I am pretty fascinated by the moon how about you? agent_1:Yes I am.  I didn't know moon dust causes moon hay fever, did you? agent_2:I did not I thought the space suit was solely for oxygen but I guess it is also to protect them. The moon is not flat you know the tallest point is almost 2000 meters higher than Mt Everest. agent_1:Wow! I did not know that, very interesting.  I guess some people believed one of Mar's moons was artificial! agent_2:There is all kinds of funny ideas such as the moon landing being fake.

How long have you played? agent_2:I have played 20 years, The hindenburg blimp had a piano built for the lounge! agent_1:That is very impressive, I'm sure you are quite talented.  And wow, whenever I think of blimps I think of the Indiana Jones movie.   agent_2:There was a group of climbers that climbed Britain's tallest mountain and found a piano on top! agent_1:That is the craziest fact I have heard so far.  I wonder why someone would do that.  agent_2:I don't know but it is pretty cool! Pianos are very old instruments created in 1700!! agent_1:That is old, I wonder how much some of those pianos if they are still around are worth today? agent_2:I would imagine quite a lot!

I do love music except of stuff like accordions.  I definitely wouldn't pay $25 a ticket for that kind of music. agent_1:No, and it's shocking that a creed concert was so bad that people filed a lawsuit against them, on the other hand I don't really like creed so I'm not that surprised haha agent_2:Wow, they must have been really buzzed.  I don't know if Creed is considered pop but I mostly like alternative and stuff off the beaten path.  You? agent_1:I really like classic rock and 80's, I can listen to almost anything except country, I do like pink floyd a lot and that's awesome they did a live concert to no audience haha agent_2:I do like 80s stuff like REM and the B52s... I even go back further once in a while and listed to Pink Floyd as recorded on a floating recording studio.   agent_1:ha I would love to do that, I do like Queen, I didn't know their guitarist uses coins as guitar picks, did you see the new movie that came out about Queen? agent_2:Loved Freddie and his band... I haven't seen the movie yet but want to... Did ya know that scientists declared ""We Are the Champions"" the catchiest pop song of all time.  Scientists? agent_1:haha like how do you measure that? It is catchy but I would think it would be another song, ti's scary that lincoln park has done 324 concerts in 2001, that's almost 1 per day that sounds exhausting agent_2:Yep.  That's crazy.  They must like doing it cause that has to take its toll.  I guess performers like that go all the way back to ancient Greece and Rome.  We still use their acoustic designs for venues/amphitheaters.  agent_1:Yes that is probably why Pink Floyd played the live concert in that Roman amphitheater, even though there was no one their the acoustics must have been amazing, it's shocking they didn't record a video at least agent_2:No kidding... I would like to see that.  Pink Floyd is very creative but on the dark side.  While I'm not big on pop at least it's mostly upbeat albeit mind numbing...  agent_1:ya it is, pop music is good in small quantities for me, I like more complex stuff but pop music is good to pass the time and for parties agent_2:Yeah… I prefer guitars and amped up stuff to most R&B, rap and hip-hop."	agent_1:I can't believe that the Ramones played a total of 2,263 concerts so far that is a massive number.	agent_2 likes music. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'genre', 'musician'].

I find it funny that Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Greek mythology. agent_1:That is sort of odd.  There is even a wiki that ranks fictional characters by their powers, that would be an interesting read. agent_2:And in Greek literature there wasn't much kissing. Romantic kissing is actually a recent development. agent_1:That surprises me, I  guess I always associated it with all love stories.  Even Shakespeare. agent_2:Yeah I think there was a lot of romance just kissing wasn't part of it. agent_1:I see.  Winston Churchill won a Nobel Prize, for literature.  I always though it was for peace agent_2:Interesting! Literature was an olympic event from 1912 to 1952. I always associate the olympics with sports! agent_1:Same here, I always thought it was part of the ancient games but never made its way to the modern games.  How do you even judge that? agent_2:Yeah, pretty subjective. Speaking of literature contests, there isone that challenges writers to come up with the worst opening sentence for a novel. agent_1:I heard there was, I wonder what the winners were, those would be fun to read. agent_2:Do you think that literature should be censored? agent_1:Absolutely not!  That is why I hated to hear that the FDA burned 6 tons of literature agent_2:But should fan fiction be allowed? George RR Martin says it is copyright infringement and isn't useful for aspiring writers. agent_1:i think so.

Have you seen it? agent_1:I heard about it. Christopher Robin is the adult version of winnie the pooh right? agent_2:Yeah, that's the one.  Ewan McGregor is Christopher Robin as an adult.  But he ends up going back to the land that Winnie the Pooh and Tiger and all of them live in. agent_1:I think it's plot sounds wonderful for not only children, but also adults to reconnect with their childhoods in a similar manner agent_2:Yeah.  It was pretty nostalgic for me since I used to love Winnie the Pooh as a kid.  It was fun.  I recommend it, if you're interested. agent_1:Sweet. It is too bad the real christopher robin disliked winnie the pooh agent_2:Is that true?  I hadn't heard about that. agent_1:Ya I guess he felt it was too close to his real life and perhaps he would rather have a father than a child's story agent_2:Wow!  That's really interesting!  I can understand that.  Unfortunately, the movie didn't really address any of that.  That would have been cool to know as just a side bit of info while watching. agent_1:Well regardless of how the real Christoper felt, it is hard to deny the place of winnie the pooh in the hearts of millions of children and adults today agent_2:True.  Disney really hit it big getting to make that movie.  	agent_1:Well disney has always done a good job in making great movies that are appealing to both children and adults	agent_2 likes movie. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'movie character', 'winnie the pooh'].
6446	agent_1:Do you know anything about the dance program at Duke University? agent_2:No, I don't really but they recently celebrated the opening of the new Rubenstein arts center. agent_1:Who was Duke's first vice Provost for the arts? agent_2:Scott Lindroth I believe. I love how they have these applied arts programs to bring them balance and something different and meaningful to them. agent_1:I heard that since his time, Duke has grown to have 98 student arts groups. agent_2:That is really amazing, love this idea. they have so many more classes directed at the arts now more than ever which is awesome. 	agent_1:I wonder how many programs are devoted to the acoustic piano?	agent_2 likes music. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'education', 'arts'].
13268	agent_1:I built a toy robot once. Have you? agent_2:No, I'd probably electrocute myself if I tried, but it would be cool to have a pet robot	agent_1:The company Anki is introducing a small table top companion.  Kind of like Alexa.

1858	agent_1:Do you like the piano? agent_2:Yes, I like the piano. I don't know how to play it, but I think that it works well in many kinds of music. agent_1:There is an aluminum grand piano that weight 356 pounds, Im guessing thats pretty light for a piano like that one agent_2:True. That was the one on the Hindenburg. Probably sounded pretty tinny. Aluminum. Hm. agent_1:Probably yeah, theres another cool fact about a piano, a group of climbers find one in the strangest of places agent_2:I wonder why someone put a piano up there. Did they play it? Did they want others to play it? How did they put it there? agent_1:I have no idea how it got there, that is a big mystery can you imagine reaching the top and theres a piano right there agent_2:A mystery, like the  mysterious mute man  found wandering the streets in England in 2005 and could only communicate via piano agent_1:I didnt hear about that mute man, sounds like an interesting anecdote	agent_2:Almost as strange as Richard Nixon's piano concerto, which he wrote and performed it live on the Tonight Show	agent_1 dislikes music. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'music', 'yes'].
631	agent_1:Hi there are you a baseball fan? agent_2:i like baseball. i usually watch the world series. You? agent_1:I'm a fan.  Did you know that baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if needed. agent_2:I think that is a holdover from the old days. i bet back then a player was chosen to also be manager. agent_1:I'm not sure how that worked.  The last one to do that I remember was Pete Rose back in the late 80's.  He played every day and managed at the same time. agent_2:yeah, he was a competitive guy. probably perfect for the dual role of manager/player. agent_1:Up until 2005 a married couple scheduled all 2430 major league baseball games played each year for 24 years!  I bet that could get confusing. agent_2:Yeah, i figured that was all done by computer.  I guess they had a pretty sweet gig. agent_1:Must have paid pretty good otherwise I don't think they would have done it for that long.  A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in grandfathers attic that were hidden since the 1940's.  He hit the jackpot. agent_2:Wow. I would probably sell some, and keep the rest as an investment. What would you do? agent_1:I would do exactly the same as you.  How could you not pass that up the chance to set yourself up for life? lol agent_2:Yeah, that is quite lucky.

Tom hanks is the highest box office star! agent_2:I love him, he's such a versatile actor and has played in some of my favorite movies.  Did you know Disney thought about shutting down their studio after Sleeping beauty flopped at the box office? agent_1:Yikes, was it that bad?  I have only seen it like once or twice lol.  Glad they didnt, they have come out with some really good stuff agent_2:I know right?  I loved it as a kid, I didn't think it was that bad.  You know I knew Silence of The Lambs made lots of money at the box office, but I didn't realize it came out on Valentine's day in 1991.  Did you? agent_1:Yeah, so romantic right!  lol that was a great movie,  kinda ironic about the valentines day thing lol agent_2:Did you watch the Avengers: Infinity Wars movie ? agent_1:Yes, I did,  great movie as well,  I hear it was filmed in all imax cameras!  agent_2:I loved it too!  Can't wait for the next one, I'll probably cry all over again, when I see who all died at the end of the movie. agent_1:Yeah coming out next month I think.  It was pretty sad at the end.  Bring tissue this time! agent_2:Thanos sucks!  Anyway, I haven't seen RBG, have you? agent_1:What is that? agent_2:Movie about the life of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  It sounded too dry and I'm not much of a feminist, so I passed on that one. agent_1:Oh that one,  no I didnt watch it lol I did read about it. Do you like comedy? agent_2:Yes, I do.  Mostly old stuff with Bill Murray, though!	agent_1:Hes amazing,  real funny!  He thinks kung fu hustle is the supreme acchievement of modern age in terms of comedy.

6667	agent_1:hi how are you? do you like animals? agent_2:Hi there. I do like animals though I do not have pets. I think they should have rights so they are not hurt. There's a lawyer in Switzerland who represents them in court. agent_1:i do not have any pets either. i would like a dog. that lawyer must have an interesting set of clients. LOL agent_2:H&M was selling goat hair coats and there was video footage the improper treatment of the goats. agent_1:yeah, the source of clothing is often quite disgusting. people working under terrible conditions. child labor. its sad. agent_2:H&M is trying to trace the source of all its products now. agent_1:that is good. it is easy to lose control of the supply chain. where do the materials come from? well, it is a big planet. agent_2:At least it seems more and more businesses are recognizing that transparency is important. I think because more consumers expect it. agent_1:yeah, we dont want to participate in a kind of oppression. we want clothes at a fair price. agent_2:Speaking of saving money, there was a man who wore 70 items of clothing so he didn't have to pay for baggage. I don't think that would fly in the US haha agent_1:he must have been enormous. did he make it through the x ray machine? did he fit in the seat? agent_2:Right, haha. Bulletproof clothing often seems bulky as well. Bulletproof clothing mogul Miguel Cabarello shoots his employees to test the quality of his clothes. agent_1:what?? that is crazy. his employees should shoot him a few times first. LOL agent_2:Yeah, I know. I don't think he could pay me enough. agent_1:yeah, really, there needs to be a danger pay, or a per bullet bonus or something  agent_2:Yeah because we cannot live forever like the biologically immortal jellyfish and lobster. agent_1:would you really want to live forever? i wonder if it would get boring or frustrating. it might be good to be frozen for a century then wake up for a bit. that would be fun. agent_2:Not forever, maybe just longer, haha. In the Netherlands they try to help wildlife live longer by constructing bridges for them. agent_1:that is thoughtful. the dutch seem to think a lot about nature.

4389	agent_1:Hi partner, what type of shoes do you like? agent_2:I like all kinds of shoes. I prefer shoes that are more fashionable. But, I haven't been able to afford them in recent years.  agent_1:What type of shoes do you think best for protecting one's feet? agent_2:I think any shoes with good soles are the best for protecting your feet. You need good support.  agent_1:I have little arch in my feet and I am seeking comfortable shoes. Do you have any suggesting? agent_2:I think the higher end shoes have better support in the soles. But, if you can't afford better shoes, you can always add sole supports in the shoes.  agent_1:Yes, I agree, I am referring to steel toe work shoes. Would you spend $15.00 to have a piece placed under your shoes? agent_2:No, I don't think so. I think many steel toed shoes already have the pieces in place.  agent_1:Another question, did you know that a tea bag can absorb unpleasant odor in shoes? agent_2:No, I didn't. But they can remove smells from gym bags, too. That's a good way to get those smells out. I used to wipe mine out with a Lysol wipe.  agent_1:Would you wear clothes made from animal skin? agent_2:I wear leather shoes, and they are made of animal skin...so I guess the answer is yes. Would you? agent_1:Yes, if it's made from leather, but I had to wear clothes with gator skin. I guess it's a mind game with me. agent_2:It seems people think it is acceptable to wear some clothes from certain types of animal skin but not others. It always reminds me of the movie 101 Dalmatians. Did you see that movie? agent_1:I saw about 15 minutes, but I didn't get the understanding of the movie. agent_2:I really liked the movie. The main point of the movie was that Cruella DeVille was trying to make a coat out of puppies.  agent_1:Ok, I don't mind killing animals for food, but I dislike killing for clothes, when there are many other material used to make clothes. agent_2:What is your favorite kind of fabric? agent_1:Cotton is my favorite fabric. I think about 85% of our clothes are made from cotton. agent_2:I like cotton a lot, too. I'm not a big polyester fan. I feel that the fabric feels fake. Also, it scares me that my clothes could be flammable.  agent_1:You are right. I agree with you. agent_2:Can you believe that there is a store in Alabama that only sells clothes found in unclaimed airport baggage? That's weird.	agent_1:Yes, that is weird, to sell clothes worn by don't know who or whom these clothes belongs to.

9489	agent_1:Hi what arts do you enjoy? Music, Literature, etc? agent_2:Hello - I enjoy it all. Did you know Linkin Park played 324 concerts in 2001? agent_1:That is amazing. Even the ramones who toured for 20 years only played like 100 per year agent_2:Yea that's pretty amazing. I love Linkin Park.  agent_1:Also that is almost one every day. Must have been incredibly taxing agent_2:I bet. In Croatia there is an ancient amphitheater that is still in use as a venue today. agent_1:Isn't there also one in pompeii?

7738	agent_1:Hi, how are you doing this evening? agent_2:I'm doing well, how are you?  agent_1:I'm great! Are you knowledgeable of the sport known as baseball? agent_2:Yeah, I used to play when I was younger. Did you know a 17 year old female pitcher was banned from professional baseball after she struck out babe ruth?  agent_1:That sounds unfair! She should have been hired on the spot! fans would pay to see that! agent_2:Hilarious, did you know the opposing team receives three bases if a player catches a baseball in their hat?  agent_1:How often does that happen? Has an umpire ever really done that? I have questions. agent_2:I'm not sure, it doesn't seem like a real rule does it?  agent_1:It sounds bogus. Three bases? I've never heard of that. Somebody check the rule book! Giamatti would not accept that rule. agent_2:Yeah, some of the stuff you read isn't always true. Did you know that the Chicago Cubs were the first baseball team to win Back To Back World Series.  agent_1:The Cubbies, a sad story. How could they put on such a losing streak? They signed a deal with the devil to win back to back, and then never win again. agent_2:Well they won recently didn't they? I think in 2014 or maybe it was 16, it slips my memory.  agent_1:Did they? Did they break the curse? I didn't know that. I figured they had made their deal, but now I guess they made a new deal with the devil. Why do managers wear uniforms now? agent_2:I believe they did. BTW, do you watch the show Game of Thrones?  agent_1:I've heard of it. HBO, right? Some guy wrote some books, but takes forever to get new stuff done, yeah? agent_2:It is on HBO, anyways, one of the actors who is real big and looks old in the show is actually only 25 years old.  agent_1:Hm.That sounds odd. I know that they shoot all around the world, which is a really cool thing. agent_2:Did you know the Dodgers have lost more World Series than any other team.  agent_1:That is a saddening statisic. How much the fans must deplore that record. agent_2:Yeah, it is pretty bad. Have you ever seen them play? 	agent_1:I have never seen the Dodgers but I expect that LA must have money because of the many fans. 	agent_2 likes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'team that won back to back world series', 'rules'].

What would be the three meals you would have? agent_2:I did order a bagel, meal balls and I love cheesecake, what about you? agent_1:Probably some protein like steak and a bunch of carbs. The egg and bacon bagel sounds really good though... agent_2:I guess Aspen and Denver Colorado are a lot the same, both places have lots of mountains great for skiing.	agent_1:Yeah. Do you ski?	agent_2 likes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'food', 'meal plan'].
3333	agent_1:Hi! Are you a fan of baseball, got any favorite sports teams? agent_2:I like baseball, but I don't really have a favorite team. Do you? agent_1:Don't have a favorite team either but my friends are huge Red Sox fans not sure if it's because they have gone on to win nine world series championships or what but with those stats, seems like a great accomplishment. agent_2:Well they have an amazing performance. Did you know Lebron James partly own the boston red sox? agent_1:Oh really? I didn't know that, that must be a great investment! Lots of fans have superstitions surrounding games, do you have any?  agent_2:Indeed. Do you like the mlb? agent_1:Not really, the only player I'm familiar with is Babe Ruth who was caught stealing to end the game and lose the world series in 1926. agent_2:Well it has its pros and cons. After a 17yr old female pitcher struck out babe ruth and lou gehrig, she was banned from pro baseball agent_1:I wonder how that banning action would fare in today's world and society, you think it would receive negative press? agent_2:I think it would. Most men sports leagues don't outright ban females. They usually just have very difficult requirement to meet for females like the nfl agent_1:Oh yeah, I heard about that. I wonder if thee were collectible cards and females did make it to play on the male dominant teams, would the cards be as valuable as other cards or extra valuable, like a man found three million dollars worth of cards in his grandfathers attic! agent_2:I guess attics are treasure troves agent_1:For some, unless its the attic of a hoarder. I wonder whether other sports team have requirements like baseball managers where they have to wear the uniforms because they have to play if the need arises.	agent_2:I still haven't seen the manager ever play. Are managers bench players?	agent_1 likes work. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['work', 'politics', 'no'].
7230	agent_1:Did you happen to see Bad Times at the El Royale? agent_2:I did, and I thought it was much better than what I expected, what about you? agent_1:I went to the theater. I know it did not do well in the theater and that's too bad. It was good and I'm a big fan of Drew Goddard and Jeff Bridges.  agent_2:I liked Cynthias performance I thought she was pretty good, I liked that each had a different skeleton and hidden problems agent_1:Yes she was amazing. I liked the intrigue and mystery as well. Drew Goddard also did Cabin in the Woods. Are you a fan of horror movies? agent_2:I am a fan of horro movies, what about you? do you like them? agent_1:I love them. Did you know that watching horror movies burns over 180 calories? agent_2:I didnt, I guess Im going to watch a few this weekend lol, do you know who Stephen King is? agent_1:I love Stephen King.

4582	agent_1:Have you ever seen the movie Snowden agent_2:Not yet. I know that's about the whistle blower who escaped to Russia, right?  agent_1:Yeah founder of Wikileaks. You know they published the government's plans to destroy them.  agent_2:That's right. I forgot that he found Wikileaks also. I didn't know that, but I recently learned that the government owns 86% of NV land. agent_1:That's a lot of land to be own by the government, what's their game plan, lol agent_2:Maybe Snowden knows! Apparently governments are to abide by governing principles that are to balance individual freedom and tyranny. agent_1:Yeah sounds suspect. In 2006, the us passed legislation that would protect government employees from being prosecuted for violating the Geneva conventions agent_2:Also sounds suspect. Did you know that Albert Einstein was asked to be Israel's president? But he declined. agent_1:That's deep. Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to invite Albert Einstein to the White House.  agent_2:Yeah, and the letter was intercepted and then the invitation was declined by Flexner. agent_1:Sounds like another administration i can think of.  agent_2:Einstein was very involved in American politics. To this day, his estate earns $18 million annually. agent_1:He was born in Germany right? agent_2:Yes, but he was very worldly. He was also a member of the NAACP and he charged $1 for his autograph. All of that collected money was donated to charities. agent_1:Well that doesn't sound too bad. This is strange though Albert einstein wrote a quote in 1938 and placed it in a time capsule to be opened in 6939. agent_2:6939. I wonder why so far into the future. He was a scientist and developed the theory of relativity so maybe he saw something happening in this distant future. agent_1:Maybe, thats too far in the future for me. It was not until the 19th century that the term scientist came into regular use after it was coined by the theologian, philosopher, and historian of science William Whewell in 1833.  agent_2:Just a little too far ha-ha.

8271	agent_1:Do you like sports? agent_2:I'm not really into sports, but soccer isn't bad. My friend is obsessed with it and was telling me about this guy Freddy Adu who became pro at 14, I think agent_1:Oh tell me more agent_2:Apparently he peaked early though and never really became as great as he could be agent_1:That is a shame. Do you watch the world cup? agent_2:No, but my boyfriend has been trying to get me to. He said I should start with women's soccer because the female US team hasn't placed lower than third since they started in 1991. agent_1:Despite the US not being as supportive of soccer as other sports, the us teams have done amazingly well in the world cups as you mentioned agent_2:Yeah, but i think Americans are getting tired of some of the US only sports. Soccer makes more money than football, basketball, baseball and golf combined. agent_1:That is because soccer is the most popular internationally	agent_2:I asked my boyfriend why it's called soccer here and he said it was slang for association football in the states.	agent_1 dislikes sports. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'TV show', 'TV character'].

By the time they're 15, cats have spent about 10 years of their lives sleeping agent_1:Sorry, to hear that.  I have had a cat, she passed away last year and she was 18 years old.  I believe she probably slept 16 out of those 18 years sleeping. lol agent_2:I didn't realize that they sleep so much or that there are over 70 breeds! agent_1:My cat was probably the easiest low maintenance pet I ever had,  A lot less needy than my dogs, for sure. Do own any pets? agent_2:The only pet I've ever had are fish, though I don't mind cats. I had a friend in college who wants to open her own cat cafe like they have in Japan and Taiwan agent_1:Yeah, I heard about those cafes.  People pay to have a drink and play with cats.  Sounds like an easy way to make money! agent_2:I'm not sure how easy that would be with all the food safety laws we have here in the US. Maybe that's why it hasn't become popular here.  agent_1:That's true.  Did you know that dogs have 12 different blood types and can donate at blood drives? agent_2:I wonder if their blood types work similarly to ours? I know some dogs would be able to give more blood than others based on their size	agent_1:I'm not sure, but they probably work the same, I'd think.  I'm sure there's a big need especially for dogs with cancers.	agent_2 likes health. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['health', 'pets', 'blood types'].

In my opinion the benefits outweigh the negative aspects. agent_1:Do you think it's important to use parental controls? agent_2:To an extent, but just to keep harmful stuff that they would be accidentally be exposed to. if I didnt feel my child was mature enough to handle having electronic devices then I would just not let them have them. agent_1:Yes, raising kids in the digital age can be tricky, and it is important to encourage them to develop 21st century skills for potential future STEM careers. agent_2:That is true. I think kids are growing up a lot differently than i did. I think it will actually make them smarter because whatever they want to know they can learn it right now. If they want to learn rocket science they can start to learn it on the internet today. It wasnt like that when I was a kid.	agent_1:Some people think that screen time should be managed according to content more than limits, such as an ability for parents to switch between educational and entertainment apps.	agent_2 likes technology. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['technology', 'environment', 'climate change'].
1721	"agent_1:Hello agent_2:Hi. Do you play tennis? agent_1:I used to and love it.  Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis by famous player rene ""the crocodile"" lacoste and only later adopted by polo players agent_2:I once watched a match where single point lasted nearly 30 minutes. It was historic agent_1:Wow, They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 us open agent_2:I remember when players could use just about everything for a racket except the kitchen sink agent_1:Haha, The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days. agent_2:Do you know who played in that match? agent_1:No, I sure don't.  I bet they were worn out though. agent_2:Tennis players make quite a bit of money if they win a tournament but not as much as soccer players agent_1:Yes, they do.

Probably a ssllooww learner.  The beat of drake's song ""hotline bling"" is actually sampled from timmy thomas' 1972 hit ""why we can't live together""."	agent_2:I absolutely love his music!	agent_1 likes music. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'music beat', 'sports'].

3767	agent_1:Hi, how are you? agent_2:Good. I learned a few fun facts. Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer as well as kung fu star and won the Hong Kong Cha-Cha championship in 1958. agent_1:That's cool,never would have pictured him doing the Cha Cha but it takes the same skills probably to perform Kung Fu. agent_2:Other stars you would not expect, Tupac danced ballet and was the Mouse King in his high school production of the Nutcracker. agent_1:Wow, Tupac?  You must be pulling my leg!  Never could he be a ballet dancer.  Wow! agent_2:I know but creative people are drawn to the arts. Just like how babies are drawn to music. They will spontaneously dance when they hear music and smile when they hit the beat. agent_1:Speaking of ballet, did you know that ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week? agent_2:That is a lot of shoes. They must need it for all the extreme moves they perform. Kind of like Michael Jackson's extreme lean that he has a patent on. agent_1:You're probably right! agent_2:Some birds are so beautiful it is almost like they are dancing in flight. Hummingbirds are some of my favorites. Did you know they steal spiderwebs to build their nests? agent_1:Yes, birds are amazing.  Their bones are so hollow the fearthers weigh more than their skeletons. agent_2:That is fascinating. Some birds migrate from Alaska to Mexico without sleeping! agent_1:I wouldn't make a good bird!  Couldn't do that, at all. agent_2:Me either. I sometimes worry I would be like a dodo bird. They are in a sub-family of pigeon. agent_1:Lol, didn't know that!  I read some wild Australian birds can mimic sounds like chainsaws and car alarms! agent_2:I find birds fascinating. They evolved wings and yet some lost the ability to fly like penguins. And then there are others that lived near water that became great at swimming.	agent_1:If I was a bird, I hope I would have enough smarts to evolve to thrive in my environment.  Our poor birds today are struggling.  I've watched Canadian Geese all winter try to figure out when to head back North, only to hit a blizzard and have to turn around and fly back South.

In the military hats denote a nationality, branch of service, rank or regiment. agent_2:I noticed the different hats in the military but did not know it had to do with rank.  agent_1:Yes they have a function to play. In the old west, the most popular hat was the bowler!	agent_2:Wow!

4625	agent_1:Hello, do you follow the government? agent_2:A little bit, they own almost all of Nevada.  agent_1:Yep, they own 86% of the state which is crazy. agent_2:They did test a lot of nuclear bombs there, so I don't think anyone would want those areas.  agent_1:Very good point. Did you know Wikileaks published the government's plan to shutdown Wikileaks? agent_2:No, but it is seems logical given the nature of government and Wikileak's nature to publish them.   agent_1:True. A man in France once impersonated a government official and was able to sell the Eiffel Tower twice.  agent_2:Yeah, I feel a little bad for the people that fell for it, especially the first one, he was so ashamed that he did not called to police.  agent_1:Me too. The Norwegian government once gave $1 billion to help save the Amazon rainforest.  agent_2:Do you think they will succeed ? I hope so.  agent_1:I hope so too. Do you know much about Einstein? agent_2:I know he was a scientist. Is he German ? agent_1:Yep, he was German. He was once asked to be the president of Israel.  agent_2:Why would they ask him to be president of Israel ? He must have made a ton of money with all those posters with his face.  agent_1:Not really sure. I also saw he was a member of the NAACP. agent_2:So he was actively for civics right, he seems a good man but a quirky one I have heard that he wrote something and put it is a time capsule that will be opened in 6939.   agent_1:He was a good man and very smart.

You? agent_1:I didn't love poetry either! But I do like individual poems. There's a poem that read normally is sad but becomes inspiring when read backwards.	"agent_2:That's great!

Much cooler than,  say, playing the accordion...  agent_1:Do you play any instruments? I gave up videogames and started playing the piano a couple years ago, and I haven't looked back since haha agent_2:No, unless you count an mp3 player.  I do love music except of stuff like accordions.  I definitely wouldn't pay $25 a ticket for that kind of music. agent_1:No, and it's shocking that a creed concert was so bad that people filed a lawsuit against them, on the other hand I don't really like creed so I'm not that surprised haha agent_2:Wow, they must have been really buzzed.  I don't know if Creed is considered pop but I mostly like alternative and stuff off the beaten path.  You? agent_1:I really like classic rock and 80's, I can listen to almost anything except country, I do like pink floyd a lot and that's awesome they did a live concert to no audience haha agent_2:I do like 80s stuff like REM and the B52s... I even go back further once in a while and listed to Pink Floyd as recorded on a floating recording studio.   agent_1:ha I would love to do that, I do like Queen, I didn't know their guitarist uses coins as guitar picks, did you see the new movie that came out about Queen? agent_2:Loved Freddie and his band... I haven't seen the movie yet but want to... Did ya know that scientists declared ""We Are the Champions"" the catchiest pop song of all time.  Scientists? agent_1:haha like how do you measure that? It is catchy but I would think it would be another song, ti's scary that lincoln park has done 324 concerts in 2001, that's almost 1 per day that sounds exhausting agent_2:Yep.  That's crazy.  They must like doing it cause that has to take its toll.  I guess performers like that go all the way back to ancient Greece and Rome.  We still use their acoustic designs for venues/amphitheaters.  agent_1:Yes that is probably why Pink Floyd played the live concert in that Roman amphitheater, even though there was no one their the acoustics must have been amazing, it's shocking they didn't record a video at least agent_2:No kidding... I would like to see that.  Pink Floyd is very creative but on the dark side.  While I'm not big on pop at least it's mostly upbeat albeit mind numbing...  agent_1:ya it is, pop music is good in small quantities for me, I like more complex stuff but pop music is good to pass the time and for parties"	agent_2:Yeah… I prefer guitars and amped up stuff to most R&B, rap and hip-hop.	agent_1 likes music. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'favorite song', 'We Are the Champions'].

Have you seen it? agent_1:I have not seen that one. I haven't seen Justin Beiber's Baby either but that is probably good since it is the most disliked video on the platform. agent_2:lol Poor Beib's.  Psy's video got so many views on youtube that they had to upgrade the view count integer to 64 bits. agent_1:You tube is the 2nd largest search engine behind google. Make sense since google owns them. agent_2:I believe that.  Google bought youtube for $1.65 billion dollars!  That's a lot of cash. agent_1:That is! Between youtube and netflix, they make up half of peak internet usage. agent_2:I believe it!  People love videos!  Do you have a playstation? agent_1:I kind of do... My son has one that I bought him.

There hasn't been a US president who wasn't a Republican or Democrat since 1853. agent_2:That's a good thing! Did you know in 1957 President Harry Truman visited Disneyland and refused to be photographed on the Dumbo ride so he wouldn't be associated with the Republican Party? agent_1:That's funny!  Consistent use of the red and blue colors for Republicans and Democrats started in 2000.  Could have swore they used those colors before then. agent_2:Really? I thought so too! Did you know Nevada is the only state to have a ""none of these candidates"" voting option for Presidential elections? agent_1:I didn't know that.  Every US president with a beard has been a Republican.  Interesting. agent_2:Huh. I never noticed! Hard to believe voter turnout for US Presidential elections hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years. agent_1:That's an amazing statistic.  Wow.

Crazy. agent_2:Was that at one of the big competitions, like an open or Wimbledon? agent_1:I'm not sure.  They once had to use a helicopter to dry the grass courts for the 1969 US open.

That is funny! agent_1:haha ya I like that, what is also wild to me is that there are more domesticated tigers living as pets than there are wild tigers living around asia agent_2:Wow, that is weird and sad. Speaking of which, did you hear about the tiger found in the duffel bag? agent_1:no that is really sad, poor tiger what happened to it? Why was it in a bag? agent_2:I guess it was being smuggled to the USA from Mexico. agent_1:ya I don't like that that makes me mad, do you have any pets? I guess In Japan there are more pets than there are kids under the age of fifteen agent_2:They really love their pets huh? No, I don't have any pets. Do you? agent_1:no we used to have a dog but we were only watching her for a bit and the owner took her away, we had lots of pets as kids though like iguanas and rabbits and such	agent_2:In Boulder, Colorado you cannot own a pet.

I was also shocked to learn that George Lucas's wife won an emmy while he did not. agent_2:Huh, he didn't win an Emmy for the Star War Christmas special? Haha. In 2013 Star Wars was the first film to be dubbed into a Native American language -- Navajo. 	agent_1:I find it sad that this was not done until 2013.

Did you know that a married couple scheduled all 2430 games for 24 years until 2005? agent_1:Wow, that is pretty cool.  And no I didn't know that but that is very interesting.  I wonder how they ever got that job? agent_2:I don't know, but it must be complicated since there are sometimes concerts and other uses of stadiums.  Also, it's too cold in some ballparks early in the season.  There is a form of baseball played with a kickball in Canada. agent_1:Yeah that is true, the weather is unpredictable and some stadiums don't have roofs.  Yeah I think it is called soccer-baseball or something like that.  agent_2:It is odd that managers wear baseball uniforms.  Coaches in other sports don't wear uniforms. agent_1:Yeah it is odd, but do you know why they might wear uniforms unlike other sports? agent_2:I have read that they can actually enter the game but I am not sure that I believe it.   agent_1:Yeah that is right, technically they can play if they need to.  Wouldn't that be fun to watch your team's manager play and bat.  agent_2:Some would do well because they were recently players, but sometimes they are over 60 years old.  Some of Japan's baseball fans are surprised that it is such a big deal in the US. agent_1:Yeah I know Japanese people are really into baseball.  Did you watch the world series this year? agent_2:Yes.  The American League champ plays the National League champ and the NL is not doing so well lately. agent_1:Yeah my team was one game away from representing the NL in the series.  Did you know that Babe Ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 of the series way back in 1926? agent_2:That was not a good baseball decision trying to steal that base. 	agent_1:No that doesn't sound like it.

Did you know that it evolved from a game in England? agent_1:I do like the game, yeah, and no I didnt know that, I wonder why its not popular in England then agent_2:I don't know.  Baseball is a form of an old bat and ball game played there back in the mid-18th century.  It's weird that it's popular in the US and especially Japan and not there. agent_1:It is odd, maybe as odd as the managers wearing uniforms in the field,  agent_2:I've always wondered why they do that.  I assume it's to show team membership but I don't really know. agent_1:Its because they can also play if they think its the best thing, if the need arises they can step into th field, did you hear about that man that found 3 million dollars worth of cards in his attic agent_2:So a manager can play?  I didn't know that.  If we are talking about the same man he found old baseball cards, right? agent_1:Yeah he found card that belonged to his grand father, they were just hidden in the attic, crazy luck right! agent_2:Definitely!  Those cards had been hidden away since the 1940s!  I guess the people living there either never went in the attic or never looked around. agent_1:So you said you liked baseball so maybe like the Yankees? what are your thought on the team agent_2:I like the Yankees.  There's some odd stuff with them though.  I mean, did you hear about the two pitchers that swapped families permanently back in 1973? agent_1:I didnt, why would they do that lol, that is really odd I have to Google that agent_2:It is really odd but I guess it was the 70s  so who knows.  I've even heard there is a""lost"" yankees player.  That is especially odd to me. agent_1:What does that even mean, a ''lost'' Yankees player? can you elaborate more about it agent_2:I really can't, sorry. I just heard that one thing, a lost player.

However, odor is unique in that people don't name the specific odor itself, but rather what it reminds us of. agent_2:Interesting.   Western scholars dismissed scents as unknowable, or at least unnameable for millenia. agent_1:True, but recent studies by Majid found that the Jahai, who are hunter gatherers still, are able to identify these odors by abstract names. It seems that these hunter gathers & horticulturalists can identify odors, unlike the rest of their world due to their unique cirucmstances.	agent_2:True, Kruspe and Majid propose that, when people settle into, say, horticulture or postindustrial society, other senses become relatively more important than smell. 	agent_1 likes hobby. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobby', 'culture', 'culture'].

Furthermore, they have highly mobile jaws and usually fangs for venom. agent_1:That's true. My husband pulled one out of my garden. I had never seen it before. It's a rat snake. I guess they are good for killing pests. agent_2:I think rat snakes aren't poisonous? Did you know that the fear of snakes are wired into human brains? I guess people who hate snakes should live in new Zealand since there aren't any there. agent_1:Nope, rat snakes aren't poisonous. They are actually a good kind. I have always believed no snakes should exist, so I believe we are wired for it! agent_2:I wonder what differentiates snakes from legless lizards? agent_1:That is a good question. Maybe that lizards have eyelids and some snakes dont.  agent_2:That makes sense. Personally, I don't mind snakes, although I am wary since venom can be quite potent and dangerous. As long as they aren't flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey are around my area and I can spot them well a head of time, I'm okay. agent_1:flying snakes?

During a uk tour in 2011, drake spent an ""obscene amount of money'' on first editions of children's classic books 'charlotte's web' and 'winnie the pooh'. agent_2:That's sweet, and it's interesting that he chose to graduate at 25, instead of getting his GED. agent_1:Yeah,  maybe he really liked his friends that were still in the high school.  agent_2:Kanye is so sensitive, I cannot believe that he actually cancelled appointments to rewrite his part of a song with Drake, after hearing Eminiem's verse. agent_1:Yeah,  he definitely is sensitive.  agent_2:Did you watch the show Degrassi? He was an actor on it, I've never heard of it."	agent_1:I've heard of it never watched it though.  Is that Disney?	agent_2 likes TV shows. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV shows', 'TV shows', 'yes'].
10361	agent_1:Do you tend to follow elections in the country? agent_2:Yes I plan to, it heard to decide who to vote for, I almost gave up on voting at one point. agent_1:I know how that feels; sometimes it seems like there's no good option. I can see why voter turnout has been under 70% in the past hundred years. agent_2:Yes that's true, are you plan to vote in next election? agent_1:I try to vote every time. I missed the first election when I was eligible, but the last presidential election was very interesting, so I try to research and vote every time now. agent_2:Not being personal but do you that your entire voting was negative and no positive with the president? agent_1:I definitely felt like I was voting against someone more than I was voting for someone. Was that how you felt too? agent_2:Well, I felt a little like that, My main concern is that I knew this country is going down hill with killing, drugs, rich, poor, I just wanted a change. agent_1:That's how I felt too. I think the influence of the media was a major factor. According to actual rates, it's safer than it ever was in the past, but we're able to hear about so much more. agent_2:Yes, you are right and nothing to very little is been done about it. We really need a strong and respectful leader. agent_1:Most of all we need a leader that can unify us. Elections seem so polarized lately that it will be hard to find one, though. Nobody wins if they campaign as a compromiser. agent_2:That's true, but it doesn't matter what kind of president we get, he or she will not satisfy everyone, so that's why I always say do what best for our country, this is just my opinion. 	agent_1:I agree with you completely, and I appreciate the way you say it in a respectful and nonpartisan manner. The best for the country is something that everyone should strive for.	agent_2 likes politics. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'politics', 'no'].

Did you know tupac was a dancer? agent_2:I didn't know that.  I do know that parrots do have the ability to dance in time to music. agent_1:That is cool. Yeah Tupac practiced ballet agent_2:Wow, he was really a person of diverse talents.  I heard there was this one episode of Mr. Rogers where he learned to breakdance.  Id like to see that one.  It seems as out of place as Tupac and ballet agent_1:I know and it is a diffucult type of dance too. they go through 4 pairs of shoes A WEEK agent_2:I dont even go though that in a period of months, in terms of sneakers that is. That must get expensive agent_1:Yeah I bet and they do not make that much money agent_2:Yeah, definitely not enough for a Tesla, have you seen those cars?  They are pretty neat.   agent_1:Yes they are, I hope to be able to afford one one day agent_2:Supposedly Toyota owns 10% of tesla, that might be as close as I ever get.  	agent_1:Oh wow did not know that.

I love reading articles about that part of the world, though. Like, did you read about the missile alert in Hawaii? agent_1:Yes, I remember when that happened. The entire state thought they were being attacked by North Korea. agent_2:I bet he won't shoot a missile! agent_1:I don't put anything past him. Even though we don't know how old he is, he is very intelligent and knows his way around arms. agent_2:You're right about that. He may not make the rational decisions you might expect from other leaders. agent_1:He does have a degree in physics, that alone makes him dangerous, when you factor in all the military equipment he has to play with. agent_2:In addition to the physics degree, he received one as at a military university. Plus, since his father and grandfather were leaders, you might assume that he has been aware of military and political strategies from a very young age, don't you think? agent_1:I don't know. DPK is such a secretive country. Supposedly, he learned how to drive at 3. agent_2:At 3?! I wonder if he missed out on his childhood experiences, and that is why he is spending so much money on renovating theme parks in North Korea?	agent_1:I honestly don't know much about the country, or him.

793	"agent_1:Poetry is an art that is getting forgotten agent_2:It is one of those that I feel like I don't always understand, but love to hear the analysis of and see how deep it can get.  For instance, there is a poem where if you read it one way it's sad, but read it in reverse and it's actually inspirational! agent_1:Wow, I bet that poem required a lot creativity, wrtting a poem with completely different meanings, oposing genres, genius agent_2:There is one guy that wrote a poem of over 220 words in palindrome (where it is the same backwards and forwards -- like ""nurses run"")! agent_1:Sounds really hard, did you ever read one of Edgar Allan Poe's poems? agent_2:I think I read a couple.  I feel like I know them so well because of horror and Halloween stories.  I know ""The Raven"" was pretty popular.  Do you think he made a lot of money with that poem?"	agent_1:Not really in fact he only made $9 for the publication of that poem, seems really underpaid	agent_2 dislikes work. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['work', 'poetry', 'reversed meaning'].

Did you know that freshwater fish only ""drink"" water through their skin via Osmosis? agent_2:I had no idea. How do salt water fish do it then? agent_1:They ironically drink through their mouths.  Weird.   agent_2:Yeah. The black swallower fish seems legit. And also has a big stomach! agent_1:That must be why it can eat prey twice it's own weight and 10 times it's weight?   agent_2:10 times its weight is crazy! I weigh 245 and cannot imagine eating something that weighs 2450 pounds! agent_1:LOL  Did you know that the seahorse is the only fish to not have a neck? agent_2:No but I do rememebr seeing a cartoon with Aquaman using the seahorse like a regular horse and it made me happy and laugh!"	agent_1:That's right! lol  There is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.

406	agent_1:Do you like wearing hats? It has so many functions! agent_2:I don't like them on myself but I know a lot of people that can pull them off.  agent_1:Yes me as well. In the military hats denote a nationality, branch of service, rank or regiment. agent_2:I noticed the different hats in the military but did not know it had to do with rank.  agent_1:Yes they have a function to play. In the old west, the most popular hat was the bowler! agent_2:Wow! They always show a stetson or something close so I'm shocked by that.  agent_1:Yes me as well! Tipping of ones hat arises from the knights raising their face visors. Very chivalry of them! agent_2:That's a very interesting fact. Did you know that until 1998 British politicians were required to wear a top hat if they were making a point of order? agent_1:Oh wow that seems kind of an old tradition. Kind of like that conical party hat which was derived from dunce caps! agent_2:That's also a strange hat. As far as old traditions in British politics I don't understand why they still wear powdered wigs in court either. So strange.  agent_1:Agreed. They look so silly in my opinion. A lot of rapping attire looks silly too. But the rapper Tupac was very talented as his music is in the library of congress of cultural significance. agent_2:I'm surprised they would include any rap at this point to be honest. Speaking of rap, do you know what Eminem wanted to be before he was a rapper? agent_1:I didn't know that. Very interesting. Rappers also have some odd beliefs. Like Kanye West who thinks AIDS is a man-made disease.	agent_2:Eminem actually wanted to be a comic book artist.

6542	"agent_1:Hi!  Are you a facebook user? agent_2:Yes, I do use it, but mostly for the games app's social part. I'd rather play a game. I've heard the Virtual Reality video games are pretty cool. Would you try? agent_1:I think I would try it to see what it was like. agent_2:I've seen lots of examples on Facebook of people playing a VR game and getting terrified or surprised. It looks like a lot of fun! agent_1:I wonder how much the headsets cost for it?  The fist virtual reality game was made in 1968.  I had no idea they were around then. agent_2:I thought I've heard that VR has been used for training soldiers, so I wonder if it could have been around for even longer than 1968, but kept secret! agent_1:Quite possible.  I read where 40 percent of users experience motion sickness in virtual reality. agent_2:Well, that part doesn't sound very fun. Did you know there is a NASA scientist who genuinely believes we're living in a reality generated by a computer? Or maybe multiple computers... agent_1:I didn't know that.  I know that Lockheed Martin has a virtual reality ""Mars bus"" that can take kids on a tour of Mars.  That would be neat. agent_2:Wow, I was excited when I heard a company was starting art buses to park in lots of shopping centers to look after kids while parents shop. I can't even imagine how great a VR Mars tour bus would be!!! agent_1:Hahaha  Do you know anyone that has the Oculus Rift VR headset that Facebook released? agent_2:I don't, but I'd love to try it. I am really interested in those augmented reality systems that area a type of VR. I had an idea for those Google glasses before they came out, even! agent_1:Nice!  Stanford's free artificial intelligence class uses Google plus hangouts to help them teach more effectively.  What do you think of AI?  It kind of scares me. lol agent_2:Meant to say augmented reality. I think it's strange how Tesler's Theorem for AI is whatever hasn't been done yet. Does that mean he wouldn't call the VR games AI? agent_1:I have no idea.  Good question.  AI has crushed all human records in the puzzle game ""2048"".  I haven't heard of that game. agent_2:I haven't heard of that game, either. There's a game I play where you get better by doing daily tasks. I should make an AI device to do it for me! agent_1:lol Nice!  Did you hear about the promotion that Burger King ran where if you were to unfriend 10 people on Facebook they would give you a free whopper?  I would have taken them up on that. agent_2:I think there were probably people catching on and adding 10 random people just to unfriend, though! Can you believe that in a part of Germany the Facebook like button is illegal?"	agent_1:I wonder why?  I'm going to have to look that up.

Crazy! I would have probably though the same. They said he ran right over to the person!  agent_2:Yeah he was an internal medicine practitioner before he turned to comedy so he attended to the woman until medics arrived agent_1:That is great. I heard that the audience members didn't even record this. Amazing! agent_2:That is suprising considering how glued people are to their phones agent_1:I agree. I just hope most people are happy with how he reacted. That can be crazy! agent_2:I agree the audience met him with a round of applause when he returned to the stage. agent_1:So, Did you even realize that Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 shows since 1989?? agent_2:no I did not realize that why are they cancelling so many shows?  agent_1:Personally it feels like it because so many people are so sensitive now.  agent_2:I agree with that I think people are way too sensitive now.. I liked all the shows that used to be on like 3rd Rock form the Sun it won the golden globe for best comedy series in 1997 agent_1:I loved 3rd rock!  Are you into comics at all? I am not but my boys are. agent_2:I am a huge super hero nerd lol... I love the avengers marvel or dc comics idc I like it all lol agent_1:I don't know know that much about it. Have you heard about the generic comic book? agent_2:Yeah Marvel published it in order to trademark the names of the heroes and villians agent_1:I had no idea what dc comics stands for?  agent_2:the dc stands for detective comics	agent_1:Oh!

4031	"agent_1:Hello, how do you do? agent_2:hello, I'm alright!  Have you seen the new Christopher Robin movie?  I heard it was really for the whole family.  I remember seeing the trailer where Pooh goes, ""They say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing every day!"" I thought that line was funny. agent_1:I thought it was a clever adaptation of a classic that help the now older audience reconnect and relate in order to reconnect to their youth, perhaps having imaginary pals of their own agent_2:Hmm.. sometimes I think all my pals are imaginary.  Sadly, I'm told the REAL Christopher Robin (who the books were based on) hated them and never took any money from them.  I find that sad, since his father wrote the books for him.. agent_1:That is a shame. I wonder why the real chris hated them. Perhaps he wanted a father to be there for him rather than children books agent_2:I think maybe he felt embarrassed because the books were based so heavily on his life.  Did you know he died on Easter in 1996?  That was one year after I graduated from high school.  Man, I feel old!  LOL agent_1:Well I hope he at least found some solace in that it inspired and that it is a indispensable part of many children worldwide agent_2:Yeah, hopefully.  Anyway, like I said, I haven't seen it, I think I'll check and see if my library has it though.  I would get it from Netflix, but I don't have a subscription at the moment.  Are you on Netflix?  It's pretty awesome! They've got like 137 million subscribers worldwide. agent_1:While I understand their business model and why people use it, I never got it. It is impressive nonetheless that they account for 33% of all bandwith in north america during peak hours agent_2:Yeah, I've heard they're especially busy in the late hours.  Get this, they have an hour long movie that's nothing but a roaring fireplace!  I think people play it a lot during the holidays or winter months to give their living rooms (or whatever) a decorative look. agent_1:I think that that is surprisingly practical for the ambiance. I bet blockbuster's ghost regrets not buying netflix agent_2:Ha, yeah!  I'm told they laughed the Netflix people out of the office when they made an offer to them.  They regret that decision for sure!   agent_1:I mean if I could pay 50million today for 2 billion in a few years wow what an investment agent_2:Get this, Netflix has people on it's staff who's job is to watch the shows and tag the content (guessing with genre tags and stuff.)  Get PAID to watch Netflix?  Where do I sign up for that?  LOL agent_1:That does sound nice. I wonder if they will start outsourcing to us turkers? agent_2:Ha, we could only hope!  Course, if I had Netflix it wouldn't be just for the movies and tv shows, I think I'd try some of their original programming as well.  For instance, I heard the show ""Stranger Things"" was really good. Have you seen that one?   agent_1:I have not, but I have heard good things about their original content lately. agent_2:Course, there's so many subscription services it's getting ridiculous.  Hulu, Amazon, Netflix, heck even Disney is coming out (or has it already?) with one for all their movies and properties.   agent_1:Well I mean they have to at least match up to their competitors so it is understandable. All that is left for consumers is to see who provides the best service agent_2:Yeah, but it must suck if several of them offer exclusively shows/movies that you REALLY to see.  When it was all just Netflix, you pretty much could get whatever you wanted... Did you know Disney makes $1,110 per SECOND?  Wow... that blows my mind. agent_1:That is amazing. Disney sure has come a long way and while you don't really think of disney as a media company and more of a amusement park and animation studio, it is the largest media conglomerate in terms of revenue"	agent_2:I think it's crazy when you think about just how much STUFF they own now.

I have yet to see her in that movie, I really want to though.  agent_2:Me too. The last Jedi divided it's fans agent_1:Yeah I think each movie does because there are so many of them and they all have their different tastes.

I did know however that Even though John Carter was considered a flop for Disney, it did great in Russia, even breaking box office records agent_1:Disney considered shutting down their animation studio after sleeping beauty was a box office failure. agent_2:Good think it didn't.  If you take inflation into account, the original Star Wars trilogy made more money that the prequels in the US by $1,328,009,800. agent_1:wow thats crazy!

Did you know they call kickball soccer-baseball in Canada? agent_2:It is nice to sit outside and watch a baseball game in warm weather. I agree.  I didn't know they call kickball ""soccer-baseball"" in Canada.  That is funny. agent_1:I wonder why they call it that.  I'm always wondered why baseball managers wear uniforms...I guess they can play for their teams if needed.  Interesting. agent_2:Do you know who the baseball player Angel Hernandez is? agent_1:He is actually an umpire.  He has a bad reputation for blowing calls. agent_2:That's what I heard.  And he tried to accuse the Yankees and Joe Torre of discrimination against him.  I think being an umpire must be difficult agent_1:I wouldn't want to be one.

You'll have to google it if you don't know about it. agent_2:I heard about that in the news.  Same thing with being a ref in a tennis match or a soccer match.  It's a tough job.  At least there is video playback.  But human error plays a roll always."	agent_1:It does.

7197	agent_1:Good morning! As someone who suffers from ophiophobia. I am pleased to learn there are no snakes in New Zealand.  agent_2:I hate snakes.  agent_1:Did you know that there is even a flying snake?  agent_2:No I did not.  But crocodiles, which I also hate, are related more to birds than snakes.  agent_1:I like the crocs, and I guess monkey's share our fear of snakes. agent_2:They must be smart, lol.  What about the legless lizards.  They look like snakes  agent_1:I don't like those either, nor eels. I do think it's fascinating that they have their paired organs one in front of another, opposed to side-by-side. agent_2:That is fascinating.  I also think that the fact that In Britain, politicians had tomwear a top hat if making a point of order in the house of commons until 1998. agent_1:That's insane. Kinda like people thinking that in the old west, the bowler was most popular, not the cowboy hat. agent_2:Oh really, neat.  When someone tips their hat to you, it originated from knights lifting their face visors to show friendliness. agent_1:I did know that! It was explained to us at Medieval Times. Yet, the length of ladies hatpins were regulated, so they could not be used as a weapon. agent_2:That sounds reasonable.  Some hats even have religious fuct agent_1:Do you know what the function of the turban worn by Sikhs is? agent_2:No but I know it's a religious thing, just like mitres worn by Bishops. agent_1:The chef's Toque is just silly, it gets in the way and looks like a coffee filter. agent_2:lol, yes it does.  Do you like to Dance?  Did you know that Bruce Lee was actually a great dancer.  He won the Hong Kong cha cha championship in 1958. agent_1:I don't dance. I am not cordinated at all. I like watching people dance. I think its cute how babies break out in dance when they hear music.	agent_2:That is adorable.  My wife has a degree in dance.

I heard that Ursula K Le Guin who is known for her science fiction and fantasy novels, finshed a collection of poetry before her death. agent_1:Wow i did not know that. Did you know that Demetri Martin wrote a 224 word palindrome poem? agent_2:Interesting! Le Guin, in her poem ""Normal"" talks about not feeling bad to crush others to achieve goals. But the poem wanted to demonstrat that we should not let destructive attitudes prevail agent_1:ok. You know how much the famus author Edgar Allen poe received for the publication of the raven? agent_2:It was $9. Depressing! Speaking of depressing, there is one  poem that when read normally is depressing but read backwards is inspiring."	agent_1:Wow that's one i would like to read.

Summer was considered a bad time to release a movie in the theater because of low sales until steven spielberg's jaws. agent_1:Steven spielberg still makes millions from star wars off a bet with george lucas they made in 1977! agent_2:haha thats awesome,  I wonder what the bet was.Steven spielberg played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack.  agent_1:I was wondering the same! After filming the goonies steven spielberg flew the entire cast to hawaii and surprised director richard donner with a cookout. agent_2:Amazing!  Thats so nice. When steven spielberg rode jurassic park the ride on opening day he requested that he was let off before the 84 foot drop agent_1:Too funny! Speaking of entertainers that make a lot of money, With over $8.5 billion worldwide film earnings, tom hanks is the highest all-time box office star. agent_2:He is very talented. Disney considered shutting down their animation studio after sleeping beauty was a box office failure. agent_1:Good thing they didn't! Disney's ""treasure planet"" was one of the most expensive box office flops of all time."	agent_2:yeah,  I read that recently,  I never saw it.

A pajama party and a live satirical operetta with talented musician clowns. that is something else agent_1:The use of a pillow pit might be a little bit disturbing for some! agent_2:It might. And it is nice they start with sweet dreams from Eurythmics agent_1:live players doing popular music like Dream On as part of the show is surprising! agent_2:They play with music and even with toys. They did release beach balls in pirates of penzance, fun agent_1:They also swap genders in the production of Pinafore. agent_2:the price is not expensive, $30 to $74 agent_1:Not unexpected, given that the theater only holds 100 or so people.	agent_2:How much do you like jazz	agent_1 likes music. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'weekend', 'theme'].

11040	agent_1:Hello.  Did you vote in the mid term election? agent_2:Hi yes I did. How about you? agent_1:I did. I think it is very important for all of us to vote. agent_2:It is important. I also like trivia about politics. Did you know that the senate used the same gavel for 165 years until Richard Nixon cracked it? agent_1:I heard about it.  Why did Nixon crack the gavel? He was not supposed to use it. agent_2:I doubt that he did it on purpose. He probably just got carried away. But I'll bet he felt pretty bad. agent_1:I said earlier that voting is important.  In India, they went even further.  They set up a polling booth in a forest full of lions just to give one person the opportunity to vote. agent_2:I don't think we would go that far do you? agent_1:No, I do not think so.  Did you hear about the senate and their candy drawer?   agent_2:Yeah, it must be nice. But I guess you have to give some of them free candy just to show up. Look at the Senator they had to drag in by his feet in 1988. agent_1:Yes, I heard the obscure rule that was invoked by a US senator.  Do you know which senators got arrested and forced to come to the chamber to vote? agent_2:No agent_1:Oh, okay.  I accept your explanation.   agent_2:Did you know astronauts voted from space. Not surprising when you consider some other voters are lost in space. agent_1:Yes, I heard.  I don't how how they do it though because they cannot just say it to the people on the ground. agent_2:That's a good point. Did you hear that Austin Texas voted to rename their garbage dump after fred durst. I wonder what he did? agent_1:Texans were going to vote.  Did it pass?  I do not know who Fred Durst is or was.  I'm sure it was someone important to Texans. agent_2:Yes they voted to rename the dump. I'm thinking he must have been a corrupt politician or something. It's not exactly an honor. agent_1:You are right.  It should not be an honor.  I do not want my name to be on a garbage dump.  I will research further out of curiosity. 	agent_2:I think I will too.

8131	agent_1:Hi, how are you? Do you like jazz? agent_2:Hi there! Yeah I do like jazz! Do you? agent_1:Yes, I love jazz. I am listening to some right now.  agent_2:Ah nice! Yeah Jazz is interesting to me simply because it originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans. It's definitely rare and unique, in my opinion.  agent_1:It certainly is. I think that it should be more popular, but it is too artistic. Not enough show business, too much art. agent_2:Can you believe that Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts? Wow jazz has made it's way from New Orleans around the entire world! agent_1:Yes, even in Pakistan. I figure that there is value in all genres of music. Perhaps the rest of the world sees the value in jazz. agent_2:There certainly is value in all music, I agree! Which reminds me that I just recently heard that Clint Eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast, pianist, and he's scored several films, including Million Dollar Baby! agent_1:He seems like a tough guy, but he is an actor and artist so I'm not surprised. He is not a very good singer though. agent_2:Haha, then maybe I should be happy I've not heard him sing! So I was reading about how jazz trumpeters grew goatees to make playing a bit more comfortable. I wonder if that is possibly the origin of goatees. Maybe, maybe not! agent_1:He sang at the end of Gran Turino. I think people tried all kinds of facial hair, but for brass, maybe it's an obvious choice. agent_2:Hm. I did watch that movie but I just can't remember him singing! I'll check it out again, since now I'm pretty curious! :) agent_1:Right at the end. Then another singer takes over. Clint writes good melodies though.  agent_2:Interesting to be able to write melodies but not be able to sing so well! I pretty much have the opposite problem. Haha. Clint seems like such a new-age cowboy to me. Speaking of cowboys! The most popular hat in the old west was the bowler hat and not even the cowboy hat! agent_1:I guess the bowler was style and class and the cowboy hat was a working hat.  agent_2:Personally I prefer cowboy hats, especially since it's associated with hard work, instead of just sophistication and such. :)  agent_1:Yes, they have their own kind of cool. the bowler looks stuffy.	agent_2:I agree! I prefer hates for functionality such as protecting against weather conditions, sun, and even beanie's for cold weather!

Well the Cubs won back to back championships and then nothing for a while agent_1:WOw I wonder what happened there. IN Japan the sport is so popular that they don't believe it is just a pastime in the US agent_2:WOw nice. Do you know the song Royal by Lorde? agent_1:Yeah I do, is it somehow related to baseball or the games? agent_2:Yeah two radio stations banned it during a game between the Giants and ROyals	agent_1:Haha that makes so much sense, staying neutral	agent_2 dislikes politics. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'sports', 'work'].
6152	agent_1:Hi! I recently learned that baseball managers are required to wear uniforms as well because they have to technically play should there be a need. So that must mean, they must stay in shape too right? agent_2:that is interesting, do you think they ever played in a game ? agent_1:I don't think so, I don't watch too much baseball and I don't collect cards either, but I might reconsider seeing how valuable they are when a man found three million dollars worth of cards in his grandfather's attic! agent_2:I had heard about that, imagine being set for life overnight like that! agent_1:How would you sell it? I imagine the buyers would be a small population. agent_2:I suppose so, do you think he took a loss in value trying to sell them for what he could get? agent_1:I think I would and I wonder if he knew the value when he sold them. If he didn't that would be very painful. agent_2:That really would be sad if someone exploited him	agent_1:Do you have a favorite baseball team?

I think it's cool that Pixar studio has a secret room that is often visited by celebrities. agent_1:Yeah for sure! I just heard about that room a few days ago. Speaking of Disney, do you like the movie Aladdin? agent_2:Yeah Aladdin is one of my favorites and I am looking forward to the remake. I really enjoyed Robin Williams in the original. agent_1:Me too. I miss him making films. I guess he started the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films. What a legend. agent_2:Very much a legend. Rest in peace Robin. Celebrities make so much money. For example judge Judy makes $123,000 per episode. agent_1:That's crazy! I don't even watch Judge Judy. Celebs make too much, I think. agent_2:Yeah I think we should put our priorities in different things not just celebrities. But some celebrities do good like that celebrity TV chef in Ethiopia who is trying to combat his countries hunger problem. agent_1:That's super interesting. Its crazy to think how much celebrities and pop culture influences our lives. There's this show called Game of Thrones that everyone is talking about. agent_2:Oh yeah I love that show. I am so excited for the finale. There is even a National Geographic show that is like Game of Thrones except with lions. agent_1:I've never watched the show! What is it about? agent_2:It is very complicated but it is set long ago on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos. It is all about attaining power essentially! agent_1:That sounds like something I might want to watch in the future. I've been thinking about naming my future child Arya. Apparently, that's a character in the show! I guess it's the fastest rising baby name. agent_2:Yeah that is a really cool name. That show has done a lot. Ireland actually pays the series so that the film scenes boost tourism for Ireland. agent_1:Interesting. I've always wanted to see Ireland. I guess there are a lot of horses there, and I am interested in seeing them. agent_2:Yes and it is also very green and beautiful. You would definitely like the Show Game of Thrones because there are a lot of horses in the show. agent_1:I'll have to check it out sometime. Are you interested in horses as well?	agent_2:Yeah I have rode horses quite a bit. They are very unique and loving animals.

4667	agent_1:Hi there! Do you think voting is important? agent_2:No today i don't, sorry i think it's all rigged.What about you?  agent_1:Yeah, sadly, I feel the same. Maybe the system still needs to be developed. Up until 1918 not all men in UK had the vote. agent_2:Right i heard that. Did you know astronauts get to vote from space?  agent_1:Neat! And in India they even set up a voting booth for one voter in area saturated with lions. agent_2:Guess they did want him to vote. That sounds unusually cruel.  agent_1:I wonder if in India they vote what to name their garbage dumps. In Austin, Texas they voted to name theirs after Fred Durst. agent_2:Wow that is to funny, i wonder why? Another unfortunate fact is that 34% of black males will never have the chance to vote agent_1:That's sad. And a lot of eligible voters do not show up. The turnout for presidential elections has not reached 63 percent in the last 100 years. agent_2:Right! heres an interesting fact since 1900 the taller candidate has always won. agent_1:Wow! So officials in Ancient Athens were appointed by lottery. They thought elections would cause oligarchy. And knowing the fact you just told me doesn't make me have faith in the system either! agent_2:It' supposed to be a formal group decision making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office. We know it;s not.  agent_1:Do you think they should add a none of these candidates voting option for all elections? agent_2:I'm on the fence about that. I know Nevada has it but i wonder what the benefits are beside knowing who voted and who didn't. agent_1:Yeah, there needs to be electoral reform, so that fair electorial systems are put in place. agent_2:Right i'm with you. Did you know that one of the moons of Jupiter would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun? agent_1:Wow. Speaking of planets, I was sad when Pluto was deemed not a planet! I grew up being taught that it was! agent_2:I know and then all of a sudden right! I hear they discovered building block for life some 455 light years away. I wonder how?  agent_1:Yeah, I'm not sure. And I always thought planets spun in a similar manner. Venus doesn't tilt so it has no seasons, and it also rotates clock wise unlike other planets.	agent_2:Wow!

11820	"agent_1:Hi, how are you doing this evening? agent_2:Great.  Did you know Ugg Boots were invented by surfers to keep their feet warm? agent_1:Surprised to hear that. I wonder how the surfer would fare with 5,000 year old shoes.  agent_2:They would probably make them into sandals and put dry tea bags in them to remove the smell.  agent_1:Ah, yes, but what kind of tea? Free-range organic tea? NFL player Steve Smith leaves his cleats on the field after every game. He hopes to raise awareness of homeless people without shoes. I bet he doesn't put tea in his shoes. agent_2:I bet they get stolen.  So many of these rich football people and their ""caring.""  The need to put their money where their mouth is like Norway.  They gave $1B to save Amazon rain forests.  agent_1: I wish the US gov’t would do something like that.The US gov’t owns 86% of the land in Nevada. I want to know what secret activities they’re engaged in there. Have that many aliens landed in Nevada? Is that their refueling station? agent_2:Most of that is BLM land leased to ranchers.  That other 14% must be Vegas.  agent_1:A man in France pretended to be a government official, and sold the Eiffel Tower not once, but twice. Maybe he could sell the land in Nevada for the US government and then the proceeds could go to the Amazon. agent_2:Sounds like a plan... He could get in the business of selling used ballet shoes.  They can go through 4 pairs a week. agent_1:Four pairs. I wonder how they would do with the 5000 year old shoes though. agent_2:Their toes much suffer too.  Maybe there should be ballet boots.  If they fall, they can pull themselves up by their bootstraps.  agent_1:Maybe Stephon Marbury could make an inexpensive line of pointe shoes. agent_2:Another great idea... Or use the boots that the turkey movers do in Norfolk. agent_1:Turkey mover? Is that a profession? agent_2:Yeah, farmers used to walk turkeys from Norfolk to London in the 18th century.

I wonder why it doesnt happen often, I havent seen it, that would be interesting to see though.  agent_2:nope I think they should do that more, do you like the Yankees? agent_1:I think they are a great team, the team has a lot of history for sure, do you like them? agent_2:I do actually, they win a lot and I like winning teams haha, I guess they were created in 1901 agent_1:Its a winning team for sure lol, you know that in 1973 pitchers just swapped families permanently, that seems really odd agent_2:haha wow that is odd, pretty dumb how Ben Affleck refused to wear a Yankees hat because he was a red sox fan agent_1:It does seem dumb but I guess I can respect that, he must feel identified with his team, you know that a player got suspended because he refused to get a haircut!! agent_2:wow that seems dumb! kind of weird that their uniform doesn't put names on the backs, they say it takes away the attention from the team agent_1:Yeah so what do you think about the World Series? its been played for more than a hundred years a lot of history there	agent_2:ya I don't watch it but I'm glad its there, I guess its ya been going on since about 1903	agent_1 likes TV shows. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV shows', 'sports', 'sports team'].

At least it's american made. The candy is made in pennsylvania. agent_2:What candy is made in Pennsylvania besides Hershey? agent_1:They've got milky way bars, mars bars, and even jelly beans! agent_2:Wow, that's way cooler than the fact that they didn't let women wear pants until 1993. agent_1:I know. It is so surprising to me that it took that long for two women senators to protest by wearing pants on the senate floor. agent_2:They wore pantsuits, they kept it classy. haha. agent_1:Yes they did.  Senate is very big on tradition.  They used the same gavel for 165 years until it got cracked. agent_2:Senate can be so cool, haha. Did you hear that in 1988 they arrested senators to force them to vote? I thought that sort of things only happened on House of Cards agent_1:I have heard about that.  One of the senators tried to escape and was carried feet first into the senate chamber by three officers! agent_2:Yeah, I think that rule might be from before senators were elected. They weren't elected until 1913. agent_1:Elections are a good and a bad thing.  I've heard somewhere that the people of Ancient Athens came to the conclusion that elections would lead to an oligarchy. agent_2:I think that might be because nobody votes. Voter turn out hasn't gone higher than 62% in 100 years. agent_1:Maybe some people figure there's no need to vote.  Research shows that the taller candidate wins most of the time anyway. agent_2:We should just have people voted in by lottery.

Elsa was the main villain in the original script of the movie agent_2:Yes but the let it go song was too uplifting to keep her as the villain agent_1:Yes. And the original title of the movie was the Snow Queen agent_2:Yes but they changed it because feminine titles do not seem to do well, so sad agent_1:That is sad and it is just the mentality that we have to work hard to change agent_2:Yup agreed. They also changed Rapunzel to Tangled for that same reason agent_1:Yeah. DO you have a pet? agent_2:I have two cats and a dog.

I wonder why he would say that.   agent_1:I feel so happy for Jamie Lee Curtis for the success of Halloween agent_2:Yeah I would say that she is the face of that franchise for sure.  agent_1:Researchers found that out of 1,100 films from 2007 to 2017, only 30% of the main characters were women agent_2:That is very low, I would figure there would be more. agent_1:I heard that Halloween is now the second-biggest opening ever for an R-rated horror movie. Do you know what's first? agent_2:That I don't know, maybe one of the recent ones.  I thought the Shining was good, did you ever see that one? agent_1:Yes, I loved it.

I wonder if they do that more in Japan where they take the game more seriously agent_1:I hear that they are surprised to know that baseball is an american thing lol  agent_2:Yeah it seems so. Do you know who used to do the scheduling for the major league games? agent_1:Not sure,  who?  A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in an attic!!  lucky guy! agent_2:Yeah that is amazing. It was a couple who did it for 24 years in a row agent_1:Wow, the must really love baseball!  That is a lot of time dedicated to the sport,  that is really sweet that they had something they were both passionate about though.  agent_2:Exactly because scheduling 2430 games every year is no easy feat agent_1:I know right!  Probably after a few years they developed a working system or a program. agent_2:Yeah that is a high possibility too. Do you know when the World Series was founded? agent_1:No I dont.  When? agent_2:It was founded in 1903 and at that time even the ottoman empire was in existence still agent_1:Interesting.  did you know the chicago cubs were the first team to win back to back world series? agent_2:Yes they were but then they were cursed or something because they have not won anymore since then	agent_1:I hear they actually did win again,  in 2016.	agent_2 likes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'scheduling', 'sports'].

Speaking of which, did you hear about the tiger found in the duffel bag? agent_1:no that is really sad, poor tiger what happened to it? Why was it in a bag? agent_2:I guess it was being smuggled to the USA from Mexico. agent_1:ya I don't like that that makes me mad, do you have any pets?

Do you? agent_1:no we used to have a dog but we were only watching her for a bit and the owner took her away, we had lots of pets as kids though like iguanas and rabbits and such agent_2:In Boulder, Colorado you cannot own a pet.

813	agent_1:Do you like to use computers?  agent_2:Yes I love computers. I can't imagine my life without one. In 1936 the Russians made one that ran on water. agent_1:Interesting. If you think about it, a lot of power comes from water.  agent_2:Yes such as hydropower. Apple computer's seem to be quite sensitive because if you smoke near an Apple Computer it voids the warranty. agent_1:Interesting. That doesn't sound true, but I wonder if it is the same for the iphone? agent_2:I don't know what you mean? There is a group called transhumanist's that want to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks!	agent_1:That sounds pretty cool. I would do it, would you? 	agent_2 likes outdoor activities. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['outdoor activities', 'technology', 'iPhone'].
6596	agent_1:Are you on Facebook by any chance? agent_2:yes , I found it interesting that mark zukerburg suffers from colorblindness  agent_1:I was not aware of that. Facebook debuted in 2004. I was not aware it had been so long. It makes me wonder how long I was on MySpace before that.   agent_2:I agree, I wonder why burger king wanted people to unfriend others  agent_1:I was not aware that they did. That's very strange. You'd think they'd rather advertise on the site since so many people are on there. Facebook makes most of it's revenue from advertisements.  agent_2:I understand that to be true also. I cant believe Iceland is using Facebook to rewrite their Constitution agent_1:That seems like a bad idea. People don't think before they type on Facebook and they're willing to be more ridiculous because they are behind a keyboard.  agent_2:Agreed. I have alsways really liked Micheal Jackson, and I knew he did work on the Simpsons agent_1:I have mixed feelings about him. As a pop star he was amazing, his personal life not so much. My understanding is that Freddie Mercury cancelled a duet with him because he insisted on bringing his llama to the studio. agent_2:Yes I understand the feelings, would have loved to see the 50 foot robot though	agent_1:He had some very out there ideas. I did know that Eddie Van Halen Played the guitar solo in Beat It free of charge.	agent_2 likes music. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'TV show', 'favorite artist'].
3565	agent_1:Hello there, do you attend many concerts these days? agent_2:Nope. More of a TV watcher. But know a little about the fabulously successful rapper, Drake Graham, or Drake, from Canada. Heard of him? agent_1:Yeah I have heard of him, he has made some good songs.  Do you know what age he graduated high school? agent_2:They say age 25. I'm guessing that he may have received a GED.  He's been in show business, first, a TV series called Degrassi: The Next Generation, ever since Drake was a 14 year old. Maybe dropped out of school in about 9th grade? agent_1:Yeah what I think is that he started so young he didn't have time to finish, but eventually did a GED type program.  I'm sure he is more than smart enough.  agent_2:Absolutely. I'd say the guy found his calling in the music industry, especially rap. He's also written songs, produced albums and become a savvy entrepreneur, they say. Not just your average Next Generation kid! agent_1:No, he is not, I know he has won multiple grammys as well! agent_2:Yes, earned his 2st Grammy in 2011, and has earned more for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Album. agent_1:That is very impressive.  Did you know he once sampled a Timmy Thomas hit? agent_2:No. As I mentioned, I'm more of a TV watcher. Although I'm not into reality TV much, one show I'll miss that's recently concluded after 5 seasons on HGTV is Fixer Upper. Ever see it? agent_1:No thats not one that I have seen before, is it pretty good? agent_2:It was, actually. Chip and Joanna Gaines, a conservative evangelical couple from Texas, who did not impose their religious beliefs on TV audiences, but were clearly sincere down-home folks, took houses needed fixing and turned them into dream homes for clients. It was heartwarming, and the couple were fun-loving. agent_1:That sounds pretty entertaining, I might have to check it out when I can.  agent_2:You'll have to catch back episodes from their 5 seasons (2013 to 2018). Recently they welcomed their 5th child, and ended the show, they said, to put their family 1st again. There's a whole genre of fix-up shows, PBS, on TV today. Who knew? agent_1:Well I can respect them making that decision, I'm sure it's best for their family.  agent_2:Agreed. Sorry, I meant to say that there's a whole genre of fix-it shows, all of which stem from This Old House, now on PBS, on several networks, including HGTV, today. agent_1:Oh ok, yeah I think I have heard of some of those shows before as well.  agent_2:If you want to see more of the Gaines couples work, they're written best-selling books and have a home goods line featured at Target stores. Have a Target reasonably close to you? Do you shop there?	agent_1:Yeah we do have a Target in town, I think I will check that out, thanks!	agent_2 likes shopping. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['shopping', 'music', 'concerts'].
8897	"agent_1:Do you have or have had  kids in that challenging stage of puberty entering.  agent_2:No, I do not have kids but my parents said that I was tough to deal with in this stage. I was not a well behaved kid. What about you? agent_1:I have 3 adult kids.  Only one was a real challenge.  As a parent, it's easy to feel like a failure during this phase. agent_2:Did they want all the newest clothing because when I was a kid I made my mom buy me really nice shirts. agent_1:My daughter did, not so much with my sons.  Sometimes when as a parent or husband, it's better just to walk of and regroup.  agent_2:I would make her buy me shirts that cost 100 or more. Did you know that Mark Zuckerburg the facebook Ceo, wear plain grey T-shirts that cost 300 or 400$ agent_1:That's nuts.  Mine cost less than $10.  You want nice things for your kids but when it gets ridiculous, stand your ground and don't doubt yourself.  agent_2:I really like nice clothing, clothing has always been something people love. Did you know that The greeks made asbestos clothing and it was as valuable as gold. agent_1:Sounds itchy... I think it's funny that Pilgrims wore colorful clothes, not just black. Stereotypes... I bet they didn't eat turkey all the time either.   agent_2:It amazing how traditions get passed along, I even heard about an african tribe that wears victorian cloths because german occupiers they saw. agent_1:Interesting.  It's also interesting that polo shirts were actually invented by a tennis player Lacoste nicknamed ""the gator"". agent_2:I feel like people just follow others in their beliefs. Do you belive Isaac Newton and his law of Gravity? agent_1:I'm with Einstein in that it isn't a force like Newton says but rather the curvature of space. agent_2:Do you think the earth is moving  and flying through space at 500k mph. I have heard new ideas about a motionless round earth with maybe even a dome. Did you know they say the universe makes sounds agent_1:We haven't had such ideas since Copernicus.  I thought that was put to bed.  People think what they want like the folks that think the universe is one big superhologram.  agent_2:I think our best scientist know less than 1 percent of what there is to know. Some say we all could just be inside of a black whole. I think there is another dimension, like when people take DMT agent_1:That 1% may be a generous estimate.  We've recently lost most of the universe with the unknowns of  dark matter and energy.  There is a theory that there is only one electron in the universe.  agent_2:It would be crazy if there is parallel universe, some say there is a cold spot they think could be a link to this universe. Sometimes I think space is all made up. If we are spinning so fast how can the water stay still but that same force can not hold down a butterfly. seems like one big joke sometimes. agent_1:Interesting.  I wonder if somewhere some aliens are wearing polo shirts?   agent_2:I think they are watching us at all times, those sneaky aliens.

They are all a bunch of little wolves.  agent_2:Their ancestry does go back to the wolf but dogs are more suited for human companionship. agent_1:Yeah, they took a notion to getting access to food.  Cats never really changed, they are still just cats.  Mini lions and tigers, really. agent_2:My own dog is good for hunting and for protection. I have a Boston. agent_1:Then your dog would be welcome at Google.  They are apparently anti-cat there. agent_2:I heard that as well. Dogs are the perfect companion and well behaved if trained properly. agent_1:I had honestly never heard of ""Dog Blood Drives"" until today.  I really did not know that was a thing. agent_2:I found it surprising that dogs have 12 different blood types. My dog has never donated blood. agent_1:Here's my thing.  People say that only dogs and elephants understand pointing.  Okay, that's fine, but what about apes, monkeys and corvids?  They are all relatively smart, as animals go.  Seems to me that there would be some inherent pointing in there somewhere. agent_2:I would agree that that point is hard to believe. I know apes and monkeys are able to point as well.  agent_1:The not being color blind part is interesting as well.  I had always been taught that dogs just see in shades of grey.   agent_2:I need to start one of the vending businesses to provide stray animals with food and water in exchange for recyclables. Great idea! agent_1:It is a cool idea.  Too bad the animals can't pay for it though.  I know that crows understand barter, but I dunno about the rest of them.  It doesn't seem super profitable. agent_2:I would do it just to repay dogs for all the companionship they provide to the disabled. They are truly man's best friend in my book. agent_1:You do make a really good point.  I haven't seen Deadpool 2 yet. I sure do hope there are dogs in it. agent_2:Ryan Reynolds does a great job playing in Dead Pool. The movie is immensely popular agent_1:It sounds like it.  We are really looking forward to seeing it.  It sounds like a great comedy film. agent_2:It is hard to believe that it is already the 11th installment in the series by 20th Century FOx"	agent_1:Yeah, they have done REALLY well with the franchise.

6562	agent_1:How's it going? Do you know much about VR? Looks like it is not meeting it's potential as an educational tool agent_2:Hello there, I know just a little bit, I heard that is true though, that they don't really have the ability to customize the material to the individual or coach.  agent_1:That seems odd and something that would be easy to fix if the effort was put in. Learning history and geography seems like a perfect fit for VR agent_2:Yeah I think you are right, especially for those children that are strong visual learners.  agent_1:VR does sound like a great tool for those who struggle with time limits agent_2:Yeah I think it has the potential to be.  Do you know much about AI? agent_1:Not much except for what's in pop culture, I definitely couldn't explain Tesler's Theorem that well agent_2:I think I'm about the same, I know IBM's Watson is very helpful in the medical field.   agent_1:Yea I've heard of Watson and a little about Stanford's ai class which I might have to take a look at when I got the time agent_2:Did you know the actress Kristen Stewart co-authored a paper on AI? agent_1:No, I had no clue. I don't know if I'm more surprised of that or the first vr game being made in 1968 agent_2:Holy cow, I never would have guessed that about VR.  Did you know doctors are using it to treat phobias? agent_1:Yea, I've heard of that, very cool. Lockheed Martin uses VR to tour Mars which is pretty cool also agent_2:Wow, that would be pretty cool to try, I wonder what you have to do to be a part of that? agent_1:I don't know, maybe be in a smart class or just be in a school that is nearby a Lockheed Martin facility agent_2:Yeah you are probably right.  On a different note, are you a user of Facebook? agent_1:Yea, I think I started using it in 2006, two years after it was first founded by Zuckerberg and his Harvard classmates agent_2:Yeah I think I am the same, I'm pretty sure my roommate in college set one up for me in 2005. 	agent_1:I use to like myspace a lot better in high school, Tom must be kicking himself for not buying facebook in 2005	agent_2 likes social media. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['social media', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality'].

And then one day Richard Nixon broke it LOL he truly is the master in the art of ruining things LOL agent_1:To Funny! Apparently the Senate set up a rule that the Sargent of Arms could round up missing members and carry them into the Senate chamber.  agent_2:Wow that's interesting. You know what I want to do though? I want to raid the candy desk that's in the Senate, they have a lot of good stuff like milky Way's and Mars Bars and jelly beans lol those are my favorite agent_1:Right, haha! It's a shame that women weren't allowed to wear pants on the Senate floor. At least not until 1993, wow! agent_2:That is insane! I'm glad that they fix that because that seems really silly, also I like Michael Jordan's quote. he says that he won't endorse a Democratic candidate because""Republicans buy shoes to""I wish more celebrities would follow in his footsteps agent_1:That's some kind of sentiment, kind of confusing, why not just say he's a Republican, lol! agent_2:Haha that's true. How often do you vote by the way? Did you know that astronauts vote from space? agent_1:Wow that's pretty cool. The indian Government set up a polling booth in the forest, it was full of lions. agent_2:Well that's cool. And they did that all for just a single voter too! Did you know that in the United Kingdom, not every man could vote until 1918, that's not a long time ago"	agent_1:Wow i didn't know that.

It sounds very retro. agent_1:haha that is retro, I never knew that baseball managers could start playing if they wanted to, and thats why they wear uniforms agent_2:Yes I just recently learned that, too, and thought it was very interesting! It might be like an embarrassment to the team to have to bring in a manager like that, though. What do you think? agent_1:haha ya I would think so, can you believe that baseball is super popular in Japan, I had no idea agent_2:Yea, when I worked for Target a few years ago I remember they'd have Japanese baseball on in the break room along with other TV's with American Sports. agent_1:ah that is interesting, I wish I was like the guy who found millions of dollars of baseball cards in his attic, now that would be a surprise agent_2:As long as I'm not like the guy found in a beer cooler behind a concession stand at a baseball stadium. He was found just before a braves game, too. agent_1:ya I heard about that that was crazy, did you ever play kickball as a kid? I guess it's called soccer-baseball in canada agent_2:Canadians do have some different ways about them. Soccer-baseball does sound hilarious. So does poutine, though. agent_1:haha well I do like poutine, but I think that yes soccer-baseball sounds incredibly dumb haha agent_2:I wonder if they have poutine at American baseball games? I heard they started a poutine restaurant in California. agent_1:wow that sounds delicious right now, do you ever shop at Target btw? agent_2:I like Target better than Walmart, although I don't know about the corporations as a whole and how they do business. I hear more about Walmart being unfair...don't really ever hear that about Target but who knows, I guess... agent_1:ya I don't really know, I do go to target and apparently Vermont is the only state that doesn't have a Target in it	agent_2:That's very interesting.

Have you seen the new A star is born with lady gaga and bradley cooper? agent_1:No I have not yet but I am watching it next week with friends. How about you? It rose to fame tso quickly agent_2:I haven't seen it yet either.  I heard it's good and that Bradley Cooper directed it as well as stars in it. agent_1:Yeah there is a lot of buzz. And then you have Lady Gaga on the other hand, they seem to make a great duo. agent_2:That's what I've heard.  They say she is not as good an actress as she is a singer but due to editing the movie makes the most of her singing. agent_1:Yeah, I guess. Apparently she got her name Lady because of a text glitch, from radio. agent_2:I didn't know that. I always wondered where it came from.  I like that she takes care of her fans.  I heard she bought a thousand dollars worth of pizza for fans waiting in line to see her. agent_1:Nice. Even LAPD work with her asking her to tweet that there is road work upcoming because she has so many followers. agent_2:That's pretty cool.  Speaking of cool, did you know that the Foo Fighters played a concert once that was so loud it showed up on new zealands seismic monitors? agent_1:Wow that is amazing. There is an ancient roman amphitheatre in crotia that can still be used for concerts. I wonder if theyhave played there. agent_2:I don't know but it would be great if they did.  That story about lady gaga buying pizza had me thinking about relations with fans.  I heard that a lady on her way to a dave mathews concert stopped to help a cyclist who turned out to be dave mathews!  I bet she got back stage tickets! agent_1:Wow you never know really. Do you attend music concerts much? agent_2:i use too.  Do you?  I would have went to the ABBA reunion tour concert but they turned down a billion dollars to do it. agent_1:I do from time to time. I know some bands do a lot of concerts, like Linkin park did 324 in 2011 alone. agent_2:Wow, they were some busy people!  I'd like to go to this concert I heard about that was held for dogs.

But my parents do have an Amazon Alexa and my brother has a Google home which are similar devices. do you have one by the way? agent_1:Apple always overprices their stuff allowing others to offer products that are just as good at a lower price.  Kids and young adults buy them because they are ""cute"" and popular in their little clicks. agent_2:Yep I think so. It's crazy that there have been over four hundred million smart home devices shipped back in 2017 and it is projected to reach almost 1 billion devices by the year 2022 though, so they are definitely going to get more popular over time agent_1:I still feel stupid talking to an inanimate object. Siri wasn't even and Apple development.  It was originally intended for Android but Apple bought it.  agent_2:Haha that's really weird. I also think it's weird that Apple went for the high-end Market with their homepod, when you can get a Google home for about $100 a homepod goes for almost four hundred, that's definitely a rip off agent_1:Yeah, that's Apple.  They have become more competitive but, face it, like everyone else their stuff is made somewhere in Asia. SO do you use something like Siri or Cortana? agent_2:No I just stick to Google myself, I don't know what Google's voice assistant is called but it's not Siri or Cortana, what about you? What do you use agent_1:On my phone it's Google like you.  On my laptop it's Cortana by I don't use it much.   I didn't know there was a male Siri -- a British guy?   agent_2:No I didn't know that either. I only heard the female Siri haha.

I think smart people will always be needed and computers will not take over the world. agent_2:Yes I think so. What it is crazy how far technology has come. For instance Google can use Android devices on the roads to map traffic data"	agent_1:Yeah.  I don't remember Google going down for 5 minutes in 2013.  It took 40% of web traffic with it.

I really think Bernie should run as an independent and not as democrat. The fear is always splitting the vote, but that happens anyway. agent_1:Yep that's true. Every president with a beard has always been a republican. agent_2:Really? I guess you're right. Of course the gop used to be completely different than the mess they are today. Only recently I discovered GOP stands for grand old party... agent_1:Oh wow I didn't know it stood for that either. The last time a republican was elected president without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was back in 1928. agent_2:Crazy, although I don't think there will be a Bush in 2020.

Has an umpire ever really done that? I have questions. agent_2:I'm not sure, it doesn't seem like a real rule does it?  agent_1:It sounds bogus. Three bases? I've never heard of that. Somebody check the rule book! Giamatti would not accept that rule. agent_2:Yeah, some of the stuff you read isn't always true. Did you know that the Chicago Cubs were the first baseball team to win Back To Back World Series.  agent_1:The Cubbies, a sad story. How could they put on such a losing streak?

Heard of him? agent_1:Yeah I have heard of him, he has made some good songs.  Do you know what age he graduated high school? agent_2:They say age 25. I'm guessing that he may have received a GED.  He's been in show business, first, a TV series called Degrassi: The Next Generation, ever since Drake was a 14 year old. Maybe dropped out of school in about 9th grade? agent_1:Yeah what I think is that he started so young he didn't have time to finish, but eventually did a GED type program.  I'm sure he is more than smart enough. 	agent_2:Absolutely. I'd say the guy found his calling in the music industry, especially rap.

How is that different from a movie? agent_2:You interact with it.  In fact if you ignore it, it taunts you.  Intruders invade and all kinds of things happen.  agent_1:That sounds like a great way to have fun. I bet the story line is pretty good too. You don't kill things or earn points. Is it popular? agent_2:I would guess so, it's on many different consoles. In certain parts of the story there are minefields.  agent_1:I guess I should look into this. Do you use Playstation? agent_2:No.  The most significant thing is that it can have different endings.  agent_1:I don't really play video games much anymore. Do you? Do you use computers much? I do. agent_2:I use computers a lot.  Did you know Windows 95 was the 2nd most installed SW in 1995?"	agent_1:W95 was huge for its time.

It was Bradley Cooper's directorial debut. agent_1:I will definitely check that out! Her favorite band is Iron maiden, I wouldn't have guessed that! agent_2:I wouldn't have guess that either. She apparently has a 11.4 million followers on Twitter. agent_1:That seems more assumable! She was also asked by the lapd to tweet them about some roadwork once! agent_2:Oh wow I have never heard of followers being used like that. Elton John chose Lady Gaga as his son's godmother. I didn't know they were close. agent_1:I didn't either! Do you remember the show boiling points on MTV? Lady gaga was on it before she was famous.  agent_2:Yes I vaguely remember that show.

Did you know that Apple had a clothing line back in 1986? agent_2:No I didn't know that. I wonder what those clothes look like? They're probably very colorful like the pilgrims original clothes, not the black clothes that they wore for special occasions agent_1:I wonder what apples clothing line looked like too. And speaking of Pilgrims, I thought that it was the exact opposite as what you said. I guess it is just me. agent_2:A lot of things are the opposite of what you would think. Like how ripcurl says on their clothes that they are made in China when in fact they are made in North Korea agent_1:I am not suprised that they tried to keep that a secret. I do not think anyone would buy something that was made in North Korea! agent_2:Nope I definitely would not! I also wouldn't buy clothes from unclaimed baggage, there's a store in Alabama that actually sells that stuff agent_1:Really? I would not trust that store. Professional Ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week! agent_2:That is impressive! How often do you wear shoes by the way? I want to try on the shoes that are 5000 years old and actually perform better than current shoes agent_1:I am sure that those shoes are also much, much more expensive to manufacture although trying them on would be a pretty neat experience agent_2:They probably smell bad because they're so old, we should put dry tea bags inside of them because that will absorb the odor LOL agent_1:I do not think that is the best idea..... It would probably damage the shoes. Maybe spraying it with bottle of febreeze would be better...	agent_2:Speaking of clothes, what do you think about shirts?

It might be like an embarrassment to the team to have to bring in a manager like that, though. What do you think? agent_1:haha ya I would think so, can you believe that baseball is super popular in Japan, I had no idea agent_2:Yea, when I worked for Target a few years ago I remember they'd have Japanese baseball on in the break room along with other TV's with American Sports. agent_1:ah that is interesting, I wish I was like the guy who found millions of dollars of baseball cards in his attic, now that would be a surprise agent_2:As long as I'm not like the guy found in a beer cooler behind a concession stand at a baseball stadium. He was found just before a braves game, too. agent_1:ya I heard about that that was crazy, did you ever play kickball as a kid? I guess it's called soccer-baseball in canada agent_2:Canadians do have some different ways about them. Soccer-baseball does sound hilarious. So does poutine, though. agent_1:haha well I do like poutine, but I think that yes soccer-baseball sounds incredibly dumb haha agent_2:I wonder if they have poutine at American baseball games? I heard they started a poutine restaurant in California. agent_1:wow that sounds delicious right now, do you ever shop at Target btw?	agent_2:I like Target better than Walmart, although I don't know about the corporations as a whole and how they do business.

Elsa was the main villain in the original script of the movie agent_2:Yes but the let it go song was too uplifting to keep her as the villain agent_1:Yes. And the original title of the movie was the Snow Queen agent_2:Yes but they changed it because feminine titles do not seem to do well, so sad agent_1:That is sad and it is just the mentality that we have to work hard to change	agent_2:Yup agreed.

I wonder if he's going to try and run for 2020 election for the GOP. agent_2:I don't know.  By the way McCarthy is House Minority Leader (a republican) agent_1:Ahh. that makes a bit more sense.. lol. agent_2:I guess so.  Ryan tried to shore up his power prior to leaving the house. agent_1:Definitely, I could see that. Although incumbent typically is chosen to represent the prior winning party, I don't know if the GOP is willing to deal with Trump anymore.	agent_2:It is weird.

The Netherlands is constructing special bridges for wildlife in order to connect habitats and keep animals from being hit by cars.  That's a good idea.  In the fall where I live the roads are peppered with dead animals.  I think they try to get on the roads to get warm at night and that's when they get hit. agent_1:Intriguing! Crazy that humans have lost their body hair 240,000 years ago. agent_2:Interesting. lol  There's a lawyer in Switzerland who represents animals in court.

Michael Jackson had specially made shoes for some of his own dance moves. agent_2:Wonder if that how he was able to do that ""extreme lean"" move he does.

Especially when you think that they once thought it was hollow. agent_2:That I can't tell ya.. it's just amazing all the stuff they've been able to discover just by telescopes and pictures.  Heck, they believe there's evidence of methane based life on Satan's moon, Titan.  That'd be pretty amazing if they can confirm it! agent_1:If they were smart, they would stay hidden. Oddly, an aluminum grand piano was built for the Hindenburg. I wonder how it sounded? agent_2:That's a good question, dunno if making it out of aluminum would make it sound different or not.  Like with violins.  There's a noticeable difference in sound with them depending on the type of wood used... agent_1:I don't know much about them, as neither of my kids play piano. It's interesting that Freddie Mercury and Paul McCartney used the same piano to record songs on agent_2:That'd probably make it one of the most valuable piano's ever (if it was up for sale, that is.)  Speaking of piano, did you know there's a song designed for stress testing auto-pianos?  It's called Circus Galop.  You can hear it on Youtube if you're interested... agent_1:I did not. I wonder how a piano got to the top of Britains highest mountain? agent_2:My guess?  Pranksters!  LOL.  I mean, seriously, who looks at a huge mountain, and says, ""Hey, lets get a piano up there!""   agent_1:That sounds very difficult. I've hiked the AT, and have left water behind, because it added too much weight. The BBC once decided there was nothing worth reporting, so they broadcast piano music instead. agent_2:The AT?  What's that?  Must have been a REAL slow news day.  Way the news is today I think sometimes I'd rather listen to piano music instead! agent_1:I know I would. Thank you for chatting with me today, have a wonderful day. agent_2:Hey, you too!

How about you? agent_1:I love Google, i can't stand other search engines like bing or yahoo agent_2:I refuse to use Bing because I despise Microsoft even more than Google.  agent_1:lol, Google is incredible though, it requires more computing power for one search than it took to send neil armstrong to the moon! agent_2:Yeah, pretty much any kind of personal electronic device these days would put the supercomputers of that period to shame. agent_1:that is very true, a lot has come since back then. How about siri, are you a fan? agent_2:I don't even have a smart phone, so I've never used it. Have you? agent_1:wow, you are daring, i like it! I have an iphone but never use siri, I would rather just google something instead to be honest. agent_2:I'm not really daring, LOL. I just live in a 3G dead zone and I'm self-employed, so I just need a basic tracfone in case I have an emergency on my occasional trips to town. But my laptop is all the Internet connection I need. agent_1:I have a friend like that also, no shame in that. That is perfect though with your laptop because you can still communicate with others if needed. Do you do a lot of amazon shopping? agent_2:A fair amount, although they're another corporation I hate :) I get better deals on supplements and used books. How about you? agent_1:For sure, it was started as a book company in 1994 agent_2:They're a good source of out-of-print stuff, for sure. Library Genesis is also good for obtaining ""unauthorized"" pdfs of a whole lot of books. I always check there before Amazon. agent_1:I will have to check that out, is that legal to use? I am taking my masters and books cost too much agent_2:The uploads are probably copyright violations, but I've never heard of anybody having trouble over downloading from it. And any academic book you want there's a better than 90% chance you'll find it there. Just Google ""Library Genesis"" to find mirror sites.  agent_1:wow, I will do that, thank you! Back to amazon though, jeff bezos has a clock in a mountain that will run for 10,000, i wonder why agent_2:It sounds a lot like something called the Long Now Project that did something similar, IIRC."	agent_1:I will have to look into that, that sounds interesting.

Did you know there hasn't been a president who wasn't a republican or democrat since 1853? agent_2:Wow I did not know it has been that long. I really think Bernie should run as an independent and not as democrat. The fear is always splitting the vote, but that happens anyway. agent_1:Yep that's true. Every president with a beard has always been a republican. agent_2:Really? I guess you're right. Of course the gop used to be completely different than the mess they are today. Only recently I discovered GOP stands for grand old party...	agent_1:Oh wow I didn't know it stood for that either.

It was incredibly popular when I was younger.  agent_2:I never did, but someone once found 3 million dollars worth of cards in his grandfathers attic, what a come up! agent_1:WOW! Did you know Bestbuy and Target will price match Amazon?  agent_2:no i did not, but amazon is usually very competitive, so that is impressive! agent_1:Yeah, it is. Target apparently doesn't carry tobacco products.  agent_2:that is good, in my state no grocery store can sell alcohol agent_1:Wow, not surprising. Maryland used to have a law like that.  agent_2:I am around that area, so that makes a lot of sense. Vermont is the only state without a target believe it or not! agent_1:Interesting. Why is that? I'm' curious.  agent_2:i am not sure, it is interesting, you would expect it to be Alaska or another low population state agent_1:Yeah, that is interesting.

1648	agent_1:Hi! Did you know the Prime Minister of Australia's position isn't actually in their constitution but only exists through custom? I find that surprising! agent_2:Wow I didn't know that. I also didn't know that the Prime Minister selects and then can dismiss members of the cabinet. I always wondered what they did agent_1:It's a little strange, isn't it? But on a lighter note, a radio station prank called Queen Elizabeth II back in 95, pretending to be Jean Chretien who was the Prime Minister of Canada back then. Ha! agent_2:That is very strange. Do you know who Helena Bonham Carter is? She was in the Harry Potter movies, but anyway she is the great-granddaughter of a prime minister agent_1:Is that so? I wonder if she used her family to become an actress? Ha! Well in Japan, their Prime Minister sends their residents a silver cup when they turn 100 to celebrate it. Problem is, so many are turning 100 now, they're having to find ways to make cheaper cups. That's a good thing though! agent_2:That is a good thing! What do you think about Wikileaks by the way? Apparently the government try to destroy them, but Wikileaks just leaked their plans LOL agent_1:That's kind of ironic, isn't it? I wonder if Wikileaks will tell us what the government does with the 86% of Nevada's land that they own? agent_2:That is a good question. Maybe it is Area 51 that they own haha? It's also crazy to think that Norway donated a billion dollars to help save the rainforest, I wonder if they own the land or just donated it agent_1:That's a good question. I'm glad they're taking action to protect the rainforests though! Did you ever hear about the guy in France who posed as a government official and sold the Eiffel Tower twice? It's like how did he pull that off? Someone like him could sell fire in hell! Ha! agent_2:Haha yes a very talented salesman for sure! Definitely a scam too. What do you think about the actor Johnny Depp by the way? He likes to live in France agent_1:Does he really? I think he's a great actor. Although I'm not sure about his directing skills as I still haven't seen The Brave that he directed back in 1997! agent_2:No I've never even heard of that movie. I do know that gives a good actor, I loved him in Edward Scissorhands even though he only said 196 words agent_1:That is weird to have so few lines like that! I can't believe Gene Wilder didn't watch the Willy Wonka remake because he didn't want to be disappointed in Depp. That is a little disappointing to me. agent_2:Yes that is disappointing. I hope that Johnny Depp goes through with making a biopic about dr. Seuss. That would actually be my first choice for a person to play him agent_1:Agreed. That would be cool to see. I mean, I think that film would earn him another academy award nomination. I mean, He's already been nominated for three! agent_2:Yes that is impressive! He seems like a nice guy, he adopted a one-eyed horse in one of his movies because they were going to put it down, that's nice thing to do agent_1:That's a very nice and humane thing to do! He's certainly come a long way since his rise in the 1980s with 21 Jump Street, hasn't he? agent_2:Yes absolutely! It's crazy that he was born in 1963, I remember when he was just a young man agent_1:Absolutely! Back when he was just becoming a teen idol before going on to win Best Actor at both the Golden Globes and the Screen Actor's Guild Awards! agent_2:Yes absolutely! I never knew that he was actually named John Christopher Depp II though. I wonder if his dad was also an actor?	agent_1:I wonder that as well now that you mention it! Hey, maybe one day he'll run for a position in the government! Ha! I'm sure he's wise enough to know each government has a constitution in place which as you know is a statement of its philosophies and principles! Well it was great chatting with you!

I don't have a telescope that is all the powerful though. I imagine mine is more like Galileo's telescope.  Do you have plans? agent_1:Not so much yet. My brother is getting married though! so there's that! I am trying to find the right gift for them.  agent_2:Congratulations!  Have you considered wine for a gift?  I've heard that California chardonnays are very good for challenging perceptions of what wine should taste like.	agent_1:My brother and I are not much of drinkers.

I think the album is actually called Man in the Woods. I don't think it was as good as his earlier stuff. I only really remember Say Something from this new album.	agent_1:Yeah.

Do you know that Lady Gaga is the godmother of Elton John's son? agent_2:Yes, shes tweeted about him a lot. You should follow her on twitter she has well over 11 million followers and posts all kinds of neat stuff. agent_1:I just recently followed her so I missed a lot. Speaking of, did you also know that the LAPD asked her to tweet her followers about some upcoming roadwork? agent_2:I guess they have a lot less followers. Smart idea! She's come a long way since she was on boiling points. agent_1:I forgot that show existed. I had no idea she was on that. I'm sure she's a bit embarrassed about that now.  agent_2:Maybe, you know it's funny I love her music but she's not really what I'd consider typical to what I listen to. Then I find out her favorite band is Iron Maiden and it makes sense. agent_1:I didn't know about that either. I usually prefer rock as well but I'm not against some catchy pop here and there to get my day going or to work out to. It has it's place for sure.  agent_2:I just wish she'd tour more. I have seen a few of her concerts but there are not that many opportunties. agent_1:You would think she would since that's a lot of the income for singers now. Do you enjoy going to concerts? agent_2:Yes, how about you? I think Linkin Park is the band I've seen the most. They play a lot of shows. Or at least they did :( Sadly there will be no more.	agent_1:I used to like it a lot but I don't enjoy the crowds quite as much anymore. I did hear that Linkin Park played 324 concerts in one year.

I remember seeing the trailer where Pooh goes, ""They say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing every day!"" I thought that line was funny. agent_1:I thought it was a clever adaptation of a classic that help the now older audience reconnect and relate in order to reconnect to their youth, perhaps having imaginary pals of their own agent_2:Hmm.. sometimes I think all my pals are imaginary.  Sadly, I'm told the REAL Christopher Robin (who the books were based on) hated them and never took any money from them.  I find that sad, since his father wrote the books for him.. agent_1:That is a shame. I wonder why the real chris hated them. Perhaps he wanted a father to be there for him rather than children books agent_2:I think maybe he felt embarrassed because the books were based so heavily on his life.  Did you know he died on Easter in 1996?  That was one year after I graduated from high school.  Man, I feel old!  LOL agent_1:Well I hope he at least found some solace in that it inspired and that it is a indispensable part of many children worldwide agent_2:Yeah, hopefully.  Anyway, like I said, I haven't seen it, I think I'll check and see if my library has it though.  I would get it from Netflix, but I don't have a subscription at the moment.  Are you on Netflix?

Ha! Unless they change the locations up!  Are you also a fan of Bill Nye? He actually served as a science consultant on Flubber, believe it or not! agent_1:i guess he knows a bit about the science of hypothetical substances. he is an entertaining fellow for sure. agent_2:Indeed he is! I also think it's amazing that Big Hero 6 was rendered with a 55,000 core supercomputer. That is amazing! agent_1:that is astonishing. i wonder how many processors theyll need for big hero 7. i dint see the other big hero movies. agent_2:Probably a lot more than 55,000. Ha! Did you ever see Wall-E? If so, the name is actually a tip of the hat to Walter Elias Disney himself! agent_1:that is cute. i wondered why they pickt such a strange name for a robot but now i see. but he dint have a mustache. agent_2:You're right, I don't think he did! Ha! I'd like to see Wall-E with factual hair like Kanye West's. I bet that'd be funny. Speaking of Kanye, you know he believes aids is man made?  agent_1:yes Kanye is an oddball when it comes to science.  agent_2:That is true. But he does do cool stuff every now again like the time he gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair at one of his concerts. That was nice of him! agent_1:i think that he undersatnds entertainment good but he doesnt have the knowledge for science.  agent_2:True. I loved how he did an SNL skit where he mocked himself interrupting award shows ironically two years before he interrupted Taylor Swift at an award show. Ha! agent_1:he knew the depths of his depravity and told the whole world first. i think that is honest of him  agent_2:Agreed. Since we're on the subject of rap, are you a fan of Tupac. I'm so glad his music is in the library of Congress of cultural significance. He was a talented musician! agent_1:Tupac is not my cup of tea but the man could rap the street an urban lullaby. Anyway, great chat!	agent_2:Indeed he could! I also think Eminem can as well. I'm glad he became a rapper instead of becoming a comic book artist as he wanted to do growing up.

I wonder if it has anything to do with the region of space that may be pulling galaxies outside the observable universe agent_2:Wow the universe is so marvelous and complex, there are many theories, for example that there is only one electron in the universe! agent_1:That would be insane if there is only one electron in the universe, it would mean I wasted a lot of time in chemistry class agent_2:That is a crazy theory!

You know the movie the Shining? Well, the little boy Danny didnt even know he was acting in a film till way later, that was a good idea i think because the Shining is super scary agent_2:I know!

In America we will call most anything a shirt, but in British English it is specifically what we would refer to as a dress shirt.  That could be confusing if you are visiting another country. agent_2:Oh, so that is probably what they meant-women did not used to wear dress shirts. agent_1:Maybe.  I am glad I don't work somewhere I have to wear dress shirts or button up shirts.  There are also button down shirts, which is where the collar also has buttons. agent_2:If you're in Hawaii, the official business attire is the aloha shirt.

That seems, um, uncomfortable. agent_1:Yeah, and they used to pop the collars.

Did you know years from now the earth will be helium-free?  agent_1:I did not know that.  I do find it sad however, that 80 percent of earth's forests have already been destroyed. agent_2:Yeah I think I read that somewhere as well.  It is very sad to me to think about that, and I'm sure it will continue to be destroyed. "	agent_1:We think of a day as being 24 hours long.  But when Earth was first formed, a day was only 5.5 hours!	agent_2 likes time. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['time', 'astronomy', 'astronomy interest'].
3889	"agent_1:Hello, did you know the dodo bird is actual a sub-family of the pigeon. agent_2:I didn't know that- of course I believe the bird is extinct, isn't it?  This year we recently had a bunch of hummingbirds..that was a first for me and so exciting. SO TINY.. agent_1:I also find it interesting that some birds can fly from alaska to north america without sleeping when they migrate. agent_2:Birds are very interesting because of a lot of facts.  I think it helps with their flight that their bones are hollow so not weighed down.  agent_1:Yes, they are interesting. I did not know that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. I find that very interersting. agent_2:I have watched them pull some to make them nearby.  The way they flit about is so beautiful to watch.  It is almost elegant like a dance. ..performing art! agent_1:Yes, did you know that Jackie Chan manages a k-pop band. I did not know that but i think it's cool. agent_2:It seems that so many you wouldn't think to have other interests do.  Jackie in music, Bruce Lee in dancing.  A championship even! agent_1:It seems to be in a kpop band you have to be tough because they go through bootcamps before being signed. agent_2:Boot camps for bands.. Guess it takes a lot of stamina for the dancing and singing.  Kind of the same I would assume for figure skating.  Can you imagine the work to land a triple axel? agent_1:That is true. It looks hard. Did you know babies spontaneously dance when they hear music. They are cute. agent_2:Music is a wonderful thing, so much to come out of it.  Symbiotic relationship with dance and music. Tupac was able to do both- never would have thought ballet for him though. agent_1:Yes, that definitely does not fit his image. I was surprised that ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week. That is a lot. agent_2:The tip starts to break down and doesn't hold form.  Same with skates, have to keep them sharp or can't get the edge for spins and jumps. Would have to assume that Nagasu goes through a lot of skates for this reason. agent_1:I like that she wanted to do the triple axel so bad that she dreamed she could . That shows heart for wanting to do something. agent_2:Especially when she had been passed over for the previous Olympics.  Rippon omitted his quad jump at the start, not as much heart I guess. agent_1:And she is part of the record books for being the first U.S. lady to land triple axel in olympic competition. agent_2:She had her wish of making America proud.  Guess the same can't be said for the Russians because of the prior doping scandal. agent_1:Yes, the doping scandal can be hard to come back from. It is amazing the amount of doping in sports today. agent_2:You would think that rather than compromising, like the Olympic committee did, they would just start to ban them.  Isn't teaching them anything to allow certain numbers to still participate and medal. agent_1:That's true. Did you know Michael Jackson had a patent on his leaning dance move. agent_2:I didn't know that there was a device involved in it.  Wonder with his death if the patent transferred to someone? agent_1:Maybe it got passed down to his children. agent_2:He certainly was talented.  Wonder if he did his own choreography? agent_1:I think he did. He worked too hard and I think that is what caused his death. He had his whole family to take care of really. agent_2:So much control.  At least after he left Jackson 5 he had some freedom unlike the kids in K pop. Agencies controlling everything. Yikes! agent_1:That is true and to think K-pop had it's first group of women in the 60's is surprising. I thought k-pop was pretty new. agent_2:I was vaguely familiar with H.O.T. , Korean version of Backstreet Boys. Social networking and YouTube have launched a lot of the Korean Wave. agent_1:Yes and they have the loudest and most loyal fans. agent_2:I wonder if because they are now going global with this music if you will start to see fusion music.  Would mix well with Latin beats. agent_1:I like that when North korea sank a south korean warship they blasted the k-pop song hit your heart on loud speakers. agent_2:I wonder if that song was by their own K pop girl band, moranbong,  or if they selected it from someone else? agent_1:Moranbong  band was  the most popular music group in the country. They must have a lot of fans. agent_2:It is generally classified that way..K Pop.  Seems to have a more narrow sense of description and influence than back when they were around though. agent_1:And they say with social media and tv  shows  k-pop are gaining a widespread global audience. agent_2:To think that   different styles and genres of music can influence modern culture to such an extent as to become an ""idol"" like culture is mind boggling. agent_1:Yes, and I did not realize that when they are in bootcamp they are charged for everything. So when they make it famous they have to pay it all back. agent_2:Just like any other job, pay for the training.  Unfortunately in this instance the control extends beyond all the way to love lives, behavior and diets.  Not for me thank you."	agent_1:It is like they control every part of their lives.

Interesting stuff. agent_1:Never heard that one before, lol! There is a fish called the black swallower that is capable of eating prey twice its length and 10 times its own weight. agent_2:I knew one of those in my fraternity in college I think. I was shocked to learn there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal. Only creature on earth that can claim that here on the planet. agent_1:Yeah we all know that guy! how about the loch ness monster being protected under the Scottish 1912 protection of animals act. Creatures of the great deep are extraordinary. ""The immortal Jelly fish.  agent_2:I already looked up that jellyfish on my phone. Fascinating, yes loch ness is protected and pets in Boulder, Colorado are not owned, but guarded. Interesting how different cultures handle that. agent_1:Tell me about it apparently there are more U.S. Tigers living as pets than there are living in the wild in Asia. agent_2:Yes, that is sad in some ways too. Happy we're keeping them alive, probably in zoo but going extinct in the wild is a sad statement on the planet today. agent_1:I agree. Germany became the first country to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed rights.   agent_2:While I'm a pet owner, that going a bit far. Do you give dogs and cats rights, how about those dairy cows or cattle to be eaten. Do they get lesser rights? agent_1:Very good point. My wife and I are watching Blue Planet. It's shocking some of the things that are down in the deep. they are still making discoveries every single day. Apparently the sea horse is the only fish with a neck.  agent_2:Yes, and really they say we know more about the face of the moon than the bottom of the ocean. Who knows what's down there we don't know?  Maybe the Loch Ness monster's cousin. agent_1:If you ever get a chance you should check this show, there's some amazing creatures down there. 84% of genes that are associated with diseases have counterparts in the Zebrafish.  agent_2:I read that and thought the same. I wonder how similar the Zebra Fish is to humans? Can we use that in medical research? agent_1:If we can i'm sure it will be preventative or medication. There's no money in cures. I didn't realize that we had already cloned a cat and named it Copy Cat, that's too funny. agent_2:Yes, the scientist in that experiment had a sense of humor. Related to domestication, I had no idea that domesticated animals develop a white patch on their foreheads. I wonder what causes that, it doesn't seem to have any evolutionary reason to me. agent_1:Sounds strange. I can't fathom why anyone would want a rat for a pet. I'm a little leery of guinea pigs and ferrets. anything with red eyes you can keep.   agent_2:Haha, yep. A snake doesn't seem very warm or comforting either. I don't understand why people enjoy having them as pets. And how do they find partners who accept it? agent_1:Other people who like that stuff i guess, haha. Apparently Theodore Roosevelt had 20 pets including a bear and Hyena. I wonder if he played with them much?  agent_2:Well, President of the United States, I wonder if he had them in the White House? Did he have a stable for the bear out back?"	agent_1:Some animals just should be domesticated.

I just saw that Carol Burnett was the first celebrity to appear on the childrens series sesame street agent_2:That is quite a bit different than American fantasy drama series Game of Thrones! agent_1:ethiopia has a celebrity tv chef who believes he can combat his country's hunger problems by encouraging everyone to eat more diverse foods agent_2:Perhaps he could join the cast of Game of Thrones, since they film in Croatia, Malta and all over the world! agent_1:I just saw that Charlie Chaplins granddaughter plays talisa maegry in game of thrones agent_2:Interesting.     Harry Lloyd is also a famous descendant, the great-great-great grandson of charles dickens. agent_1:some famous people.  did you know that there is a Nat Geo wild show called games of lions that follows the lives of lions like the game of thrones characters agent_2:Wow.     I wonder if Ireland helps finance that like they do the actual show! agent_1:Good question.  I saw that Arya is the fastest rising new baby name given to girls in the US most likely due to game of thrones agent_2:People like celebrities, real and fictional - almost as much as horses or Equus Ferus! agent_1:Icelandic horses have a fifth speed, tolt, that is basically speedwalking for a horse agent_2:I wonder when that started in the 45 to 55 million evolution of the species! agent_1:not sure about that.  Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 bc  agent_2:Interesting, so the entire process of getting them used to humans took 1000 years or so. agent_1:it says that domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC	agent_2:Interesting, although there are still some wild horses in nature.	agent_1 dislikes wild horses. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['wild horses', 'TV shows', 'Nat Geo wild show'].

Earth has one natural satellite is Moon. The earth receives its light and heat from the sun. agent_2:Yeah and scientists say that earth will be virtually helium free by the end of the 21st century1 Crazy! agent_1:The earth spins on its own axis it causes for the day and night changes. If day in one part of the earth may be other part of earth have night. agent_2:Earth's axis is tilted with respect to it's orbital plane, producing seasons. Thank goodness for seasons. My favorite is Spring! agent_1:The layer of the lithosphere is the upper most layer. Almost 71% of earth surface is covered with water remaining 29% is of water. The polar region are covered with snow or ice. agent_2:Hm. The planet Uranus actually rotates sideways and ""rolls"" around the sun rather than ""spinning"" like other planets! agent_1:Very interesting. Already 80% of forest area in the world has been destroyed which results in global warming and climate changes and affects the green houses of the environment. Lot of pollution also. agent_2:Yeah, sadly mostly human activities are to blame for that, including massive deforestation for many reasons.  agent_1:Planet is a term that has been used since ancient times in the context of history, astrology, science, mythology and religion. There are five planets visible to naked eyes in the solar system. agent_2:Yep, I've seen all of the naked eye planets. Have you? agent_1:Yes, Venus rises before the sun, so early that it is called the morning star. agent_2:Ah yes! Have you ever seen Jupiter or Saturn with just your eyes? agent_1:It is small planet we can see them with the help of telescope.  agent_2:Jupiter's moon Ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun.

I did not know that about the day being so short agent_1:Yeah when you think about it it makes it ever sadder to what we are doing to this planet agent_2:Well, the UN has appointed an official ambassador to extraterrestrials so hopefully we make some alien friends soon so we can move planets.  agent_1:haha, that would be kind of cool. apparently earth will be helium free by the end of this century agent_2:No more helium balloons? Aww... agent_1:I know, but maybe it is for the better. do you like animals agent_2:I don't really like them as pets but in nature yes. It's sad that the dodo bird is extinct. I hope we stop destroying the earth and habitats for animals. The dodo bird was actually a sub family of pigeon. agent_1:Yeah and I think it was a nice looking bird. I hope so too. their bones are lighter than their feathers agent_2:Yeah, this is due to their bones being hollow. agent_1:yeah, I guess that makes sense for them since they need to fly agent_2:Right. I think wild birds in Australia are neat but would probably drive me insane. They can mimic camera, car alarms, and chainsaw sounds. agent_1:hahaha I can imagine that, going out everytime to check if the car is alright	agent_2:Another neat thing to observe would be a hummingbird stealing a spiderweb's nest!	agent_1 likes animals. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['animals', 'space', 'alien'].

Isn't it nuts that a single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving reality and fantasy?  agent_2:Thats deep. People could learn more about this at an actual university agent_1:They could, too bad not everyone has access to a university though, would help everyone out a lot if it was more profitable, the inequality gap in the US is getting ridiculous! agent_2:Did you ever see Thor that came out in 2011 ? agent_1:I did, I remember watching it in the movie theater, it's the fourth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Well deserved too,  he has done a lot for the galaxy!  lol I recently learned theres a species of bat called chebacca lol  agent_2:Is there really? That is so cool. We were at the Krewe of Chewbacchus parade last year. They really nailed his voice, I don't know if they used recordings of wild animals or not, but they were awesome. agent_1:Thats awesome!  Some star wars fans think chewie and r2d2 are rebel agents lol  agent_2:lol.  Of course, that makes a lot of sense, since Chewie and Han are so close. agent_1:I never knew that chewie has a wife and 2 sons!  Hes a family man lol  agent_2:I didn't know that either. Peter Mayhew is an amazing actor, and it was a long time before I realized he played Chewie. agent_1:I never knew him until star wars,  what else has he been in? agent_2:He was in Dark Towers, back in the 80's and he also voices an animated series, I forget which one.  agent_1:Oh I see,  I guess i never seen those. Have you seen the newer star wars movies?  what do you think? agent_2:My favorite of the new ones, is Rogue One. I love that movie. I'm glad it's finally on Netflix, I'm getting tired of watching the fireplace when I can't sleep. agent_1:I really liked that one Rogue one,  so I have a Nissan Rogue,  and I named it Jyn lol Netflix is great,  watching anything good ? agent_2:lol. I really don't watch much of it, my kids are fond of their original program, The Santa Clarita Diet. agent_1:Oh I actually like that too,  its really funny.  I love the relationship between the parents,  they are so supportive lol 	agent_2:I'm not a fan of Drew Barrymoore, but she is great in that.

Did you know there hasn't been a president who wasn't a rep or dem since 1853? agent_1:I wonder who it was! If he had a beard, he would have been republican. agent_2:Not too sure on that. The last time a rep was elected president without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was back in 1928. agent_1:That just blows my mind! I didn't realize that the red and blue colors with the parties wasn't really a thing until 2000! agent_2:I agree. I didn't know that was a thing for such a shot time either.  agent_1:I think it's funny what Nevada has printed on their voting options!	agent_2:I think so too.

I fell in love with it when Edgar allen poe wrote about it. agent_2:He wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg, correct? That is awesome! Fiction is derived from the imagination and Poe had a great imagination! agent_1:Yeah. I liked Poe. Tell Tale Heart scared the heck out of me! agent_2:So true! I would like to read some of Julius Caesar's Hercules fan fiction sometimes. Or even Oedipus. I bet it's amazing. agent_1:Just don't show George martin any... He's not a fan of fan fiction... agent_2:Ha! Yeah I heard he claimed it's copyright infringement and also bad exercises for aspiring writers. I mean, he's not wrong, but a little over the top I'd say! agent_1:I think fan fiction is good. I bet he also complains that people do not write enough or how it is  lonely experience and then also complains about flattery... Seems like an inconsistent thought process.	agent_2:Agreed!

I also read that the original light saber that he used is in the space station. agent_1:thats some cool stuff. It seems to be an extremely well-liked franchise, I personally really like how the writers changed up the script so the secret of darth vader being Luke's father wouldn't be leaked  agent_2:I never knew that there was a radio broadcast of the film in 1981.  It would be fun to listen to as a podcast now. agent_1:Agreed! though 5 hours is a little long of my liking lol agent_2:I knew that luke was a twin to Princess Leia but i can't keep up with the other relatives and relationships. I would have to binge watch all of the movies. agent_1:that's going to take you a few days to do! It's cool how scientists have discovered a planters that has the ""building blocks of life"". Maybe the star wars franchise depicts what the entire universe would look like in a few hundred years agent_2:That would be amazing. The UN made an ambassador of extraterrestrials incase we ever make contact with any. Ha! agent_1:ahaha very true. The UN definitely knows something that the rest of us don't. Seems like an odd job to have, how would you even have the qualifications for something like that agent_2:And are they really paid? Who knows? Are you interested in Earth science? Did you know that when the earth was first formed, a day was only 5 and half hours long? agent_1:how would you even communicate with ""aliens"", i doubt they would speak a recognizable language lol if they already created this positions maybe we'll have contact with extraterrestrials sooner than we thought. If they came to earth do you think it'd be a friendly visit? and yes I am! so cool! agent_2:I have watch enough science fiction movies. It seems that other beings would be more advanced than we are.We seem to not be able to solve global warming. The earth is 71% water and I am afraid the polar ice caps are melting! agent_1:yeah thats a common theme i noticed in movies too! They're much more advanced and powerful, yet humans always seem to win the battle some way. But maybe aliens would be chill and would want peace with humans. You're so right, and to think that there are people who don't believe in global warming agent_2:I also read that 80 % of the earths forests have already been destroyed. Very sad agent_1:Seems like we're destroying Earth very quickly. the article mentioned that human's existence would represent 1 minute and 17 seconds in comparison to earth's entire history. Yet already we've done so much damage  agent_2:We really do have an amazing planet in that it sustains life but  there are so many planets in the universe. I wonder how uranus rolls around the sun rather than spins? agent_1:Honestly to think about how any of this exists is amazing. have you read that there's a planet with pieces of glass that perpetuate sideways at 4500mph? that almost sounds made up  agent_2:That is not something I have never heard. The fact that building blocks of life we detected 455 light years away is difficult to fathom. agent_1:Maybe there's a planet in our universe that also has living life forms. It's interesting how Venus doesn't title so therefore it has no seasons agent_2:Also I had known that Jupiter had moons but that one of them would be considered a planet if it rotated around the sun is pretty cool. agent_1:Funny how the definition of ""planets"" is controversial and how Pluto is technically no longer considered as one agent_2:That involves a lot of updating of text books! agent_1:I guess this is just the natural progression of science. definitions will change and we'll continue to discover new things"	agent_2:It has been nice chatting!	agent_1 likes small talk. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['small talk', 'astronomy', 'movie'].

What interesting facts about planets do you know? agent_1:Jupiter's moon ganymede would be a planet if it orbited the sun, do you know any? agent_2:I have heard that some planets dont have a tilted axis, and others spin on their SIDE. crazy, huh? agent_1:wow, very crazy, what would earth be like spinning on its side lol. I heard Uranus rolls around the sun agent_2:URANUS? <chuckle> What a name! Yes, i wonder what is wrong with that planet besides its awkward name. agent_1:Right lol! imagine a planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at you, that is a real thing agent_2:that sounds like a terrible vacation. i would rather go that planet 455 light years away. agent_1:right, I heard about that planet, it can possible sustain life right? agent_2:It might. we should get Elon to get some people headed toward the thing. agent_1:Right, that could be his next venture. You think we will see a man on mars in our lifetime? agent_2:Yes, we will, but how long can they be there? and what can they do that a probe cant?  agent_1:That is a valid point, I am glad someone is spending money on it. Do you think the Space Force will patrol it lol? agent_2:Um, i dont know about the Space Force. Maybe? THe govt has 22 trillion in debt. it is not a popular idea at the moment.  agent_1:I think our elected president will push it like the wall, are you a fan of him? agent_2:I am not really a trump fan. the wall is going to be in the next budget. about 8 billion. i think that the 2020 election is going to be interesting. agent_1:I think so too, I wonder who he will run against. I think if he wins it will show it was rigged again, but that is my opinion	agent_2:The democratic field is a jumble now. it is unclear how the dems will come up with someone to run against an incumbent.	agent_1 dislikes politics. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'news', 'Mars'].

Planning the meal and making everything fit on my oven is like tetris. agent_1:Yes, so do I! and I agree, Thanksgiving and Chsitmas are my favorite Holidays. and you are right especially if you only have one oven to work with like susan westmoreland says ""it's a bit like an acrobatic dance"" lol agent_2:Great way to make a word picture, yes!

Another of my all time fav things to do would be dance! although my back doesnt like it so much. I love watching dance videos... agent_2:Oh yeah, me too!Dancing while I bake pies for Thanksgiving is an exacta. I have a guilty pleasure of dancing to ballet musicals. I read that those ballerinas go through four pairs of pointe shoes per week.! agent_1:That is a daily, cooking and dancing! and ouch! 4 pairs! Oh my word, that beats my once every year. Another great dance was Michael Jackson, he had a patent on a device, I didnt know you could achieve lean in dance moves agent_2:Really, that is a cool fact. I liked his music even though the person is in question. agent_1:True, its hard to know truth from lies in the media unfortunately, Bruce lee was also a great dancer he even won the hong kong cha-cha championship in 1958!

They love to dance and watch our birds. Do you have birds? agent_2:How precious! lol. Oh yeah, we have many many birds that come fly into our windows, in fact. Hummingbirds steal the spider webs to construct the own nests too, thats a nice bonus for me and less cleaning too. agent_1:Wow, yes birds are amazing creatures and so light! their light bones are so hollow sometimes weighing less than their feathers. Love them. agent_2:Yes, so delightful and treasured. Mine will mimic things that make me run looking for alarms sometimes.lol agent_1:haha, I always wondered what such distances they can fly without resting. Ive learned that some birds can fly from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping.. I wish I could fly! Vacations would be way cheaper! agent_2:Gosh, that's a good point and they would be a lot more affordable. I am addicted to playing tetris when I fly because it takes my mind off of flying. Tetris is proven to be a quick and manageable fix for people who are trying to stick to a diet, quit smoking or drinking. I use it for flying. agent_1:Tetris! such a great game, reminds me of my youth, Its been around since ive been around lol well I guess tetris is a few years older 1984 it was created!

I've never watched the show, but I wonder if it gives you tips on what to do in case of an invasion? I understand there are some firefighters that are trained to treat aliens. agent_1:I used to watch the show. Pretty weird that Tom Cruise has a $10 million underground bunker to protect himself from aliens. "	agent_2:It is curious.

His name is rocky and he is a boss! i did not know that about the blood, I wonder if they have blood drives agent_2:There are also blood drives for dogs yes, and sounds like a cute little fellow,  agent_1:What! He is awesome, getting old though but lots of good memories. Did you know dogs and elephants are the only ones that respond to pointing. My dog loves that agent_2:I didnt know that, I guess both are really smart animals, dogs can also see color so that makes them kind of unique  agent_1:For sure! Did you ever see Deadpool 2? agent_2:I did, that movie was so fun, I really liked it, did you like it? agent_1:It was actually really good. I liked lady luck!

Did you know jazz originated in the African American communities of New Orleans in the late 19th and early 20 century. agent_2:i think I did know that.  Seems like I've seen a movie that referenced it.  Didn't they combine jazz with some brass band marches or something? agent_1:It has roots in blues and ragtime.  It is now recognized as a major form of musical expression. agent_2:I'm glad.  It's world wide now too.  Pakistan has a jazz orchestra! agent_1:Cool jazz actually originated in the 1940s. It introduced calmer smoother sounds and long linear melodic lines you hear in todays jazz. agent_2:i like that. There's a lot of good music from the 40s. agent_1:Were you aware that Clint Eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast. agent_2:No I wasn't.  i guess going by the characters he plays in movies I just never made the connection. agent_1:Oh he is a big fan. He even scored several films including million dollar baby. That is a great movie. agent_2:He did?  What instrument does he play? agent_1:I think he played a few different instruments. There is a woman in Harlem who has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every Sunday or over 20 years. agent_2:That's cool. I bet she's pretty good to last that long. agent_1:She occasionally has top performers stop by. I wonder if Clint has ever checked it out.	agent_2:You never know.

6635	agent_1:Good Morning! Do you like to travel? agent_2:I do, I travel a lot for work, but even more for leisure. I wish I could use the commuter bus the Dutch are creating. It's designed to travel at 160mph! agent_1:I would rather do that than be in Iceland where there is no rail service! agent_2:I agree with that. I wonder how many people there have never left their towns? agent_1:I'm sure many are content where they are. I would hate to live in Japan though, it costs 300 dollars in tolls to drive across country. agent_2:That would be an expensive road trip. I wonder how the first king to travel around the world got around? agent_1:I think it was King Kalakaua of Hawaii to do that and that was long before airplanes! agent_2:I wonder if he went to Mackinac Island? They've banned motorized vehicles there for over a hundred years. I bet it's peaceful there! agent_1:I bet it is, instead of hearing the snow plows like I am right now! Did you know the dodo bird was part of the pigeon family?	agent_2:I did not know that, that's pretty interesting. I've heard that some birds fly from Alaska to Norther Mexico without sleeping!

I don't think I've ever heard of it. agent_1:That is actually located in the US, I cant recall where but motorized vehicles have been banned there for more than a century agent_2:Wow! Are they trying to keep a historical feel to the area? agent_1:Seems that way, the air must be clean and free of many of the pollutants we have in the city, Japan also seems like a great destination, kind of expensive though agent_2:Japan would be an amazing cultural experience, but travel inside the country is pricey, maybe even more than travel to the country! agent_1:Yeah highway tolls cost more than $300 dollars thats too much money  agent_2:I guess if you traveled there, it would be best to focus on one city so you don't have to spend on traveling around. It's probably expensive to travel in Iceland too. Most people there without cars take flights to get from city to city! agent_1:That makes sense, seems like it would be just as expensive and the flight time is less, the firs king of Hawai sure traveled a lot	agent_2:I wonder if he was surprised at the size of the world after ruling a small chain of islands for part of his life.

You earn points for doing searches but they have a limit on the amount you can earn each day.  Did you know that google was created over 20 years ago already in 1998? agent_2:Yes. Wish I'd invested in Google stock when they made 2004 public offering! agent_1:Oh yeah!  A single google search requires more computing power than it took to send men to the moon! agent_2:Right. Mind-boggling, but shows advancements in tech. svcs. and products, doesn't it? agent_1:Yes!  Google maps calculates traffic by tracking how fast android devices are moving on the road.  That's pretty mind boggling too.  So they are pretty much tracking cell phones and using some of the data for that.  Interesting. agent_2:Well said. Did you know that if you wanted, say, to find a location in the disputed region of Kashmir, Google would show you only the map of the claims of the country (India or Pakistan) where the browser you're using is located? agent_1:I didn't know that before but now I do!  Thanks!  Do you remember when Google went down for about 5 minutes on Aug. 16th 2013 and took 40 percent of the web traffic with it?  I don't remember it. agent_2:Me, either, but I do know that internet companies like Google, or Amazon, use tech that is often beyond my comprehension...Do you suppose that's the point, really?	agent_1:It might be.

You? agent_1:I didn't love poetry either! But I do like individual poems. There's a poem that read normally is sad but becomes inspiring when read backwards. agent_2:That's great! Words can be depressing or uplifting depending on their order. Edgar Allan Poe only received $9 for the publication of ""The Raven."" I wonder if he got royalties. agent_1:That's surprising! I'm sure he got compensated somehow. I think words can be beautiful when orchestrated properly. Once I read a 224 word long poem, that turns out to be an entire palindrome! agent_2:HOw long did it take to write that poem? It sounds like something that would require a computer. I wonder if it's a pretty poem. agent_1:I'm sure it must have taken forever. On the other hand, the Japanese alphabet is naturally a poem when recited in order. agent_2:I think you mean the Javanese alphabet. The Japanese alphabet wouldn't work. Do you get a chance to go to concerts much? agent_1:Oh I think you're right! And I do sometimes! I saw Linkin Park in 2001, I thought it was very unique until finding out they had almost 324 concerts just that year. agent_2:They were on a tear, weren't they. I think they must have made a ton a cash that year. The following album must have had high expectations. I couldn't tour like that. agent_1:Oh I'm sure it must have been exhausting. Then again imagine the Ramones, they played 2,263 concerts total over 20 years, that's insane! agent_2:The Ramones must have discovered the secret of youth. How could they maintain that pace?

Well, maybe I used to. agent_1:There is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans! That seems weird... agent_2:I think it's 13 hertz, very low, below our threshold of hearing. Causes fear because I think it's like an earthquake sound. agent_1:Reallly??? That's impressive knowledge! Do you know anything about ribs agent_2:I've read that they grow back stronger after they get broken, but I haven't tested that out myself. agent_1:Yeah. I know if you smoke them with BBQ sauce for 2 hours on 180 they are delicious... agent_2:That a good tip, but they probably won't heal well after that.  agent_1:No, I am not good for the healing portion of ribs. I am on the other side of the healing line. I wonder how many ribs a black swallower fish can eat... agent_2:Times times their weight? They would get kicked out of the smorgasbord. agent_1:Yeah!

His newest album is called man of the Woods by the way agent_2:Wasn't is previous album FutureSex/LoveSounds in 2006?  What is the reason for the long dry spell? agent_1:Yeah I don't know. I think he just needed some time to get his bearings. I guess a lot of people think that his songs feel empty in this new release though agent_2:Thinking back, about the only thing I remember about Justin Timberlake is NippleGate in the 2004 Super Bowl.  From what I read, in the interim has broken into acting, gotten married and became a father.  Do people think his songs are ""empty"" because he has changed his style or do they think he has lost his musical bearing?  His major life changes may have changed his musical perspective. agent_1:Yes I think is you could alter your taste in music will change. What do you think about albums though? Who made your favorite album  agent_2:Pink Floyd ""The Wall"" is my favorite.  Did you know ""The Dark Side of the Moon"" is still one of the best selling albums after 40 years!  And yours? agent_1:Wow that's great! I also love Pink Floyd and I love Metallica, I know that my friend loves Linkin Park and they have a best selling album right now agent_2:I did not know that.  What I find interesting is the resurgence in vinyl LPs for audiophiles.  Most of my music is digital, except for some local Louisiana bands who never made it big.  I still have their vinyl albums and play them every now and then.  What do you think of NWA's Straight Outta Compton? agent_1:I think it's a great album!

Intruders invade and all kinds of things happen.  agent_1:That sounds like a great way to have fun. I bet the story line is pretty good too. You don't kill things or earn points. Is it popular? agent_2:I would guess so, it's on many different consoles. In certain parts of the story there are minefields.  agent_1:I guess I should look into this.

I use it for flying. agent_1:Tetris! such a great game, reminds me of my youth, Its been around since ive been around lol well I guess tetris is a few years older 1984 it was created!  agent_2:Yes, mine too. It is one of three of the greatest games of all time. Minecraft and Sport Wii are the other two. The tetris game has been used to help people suffering with PTSD,also. agent_1:Interesting! Do you know where it was created?"	agent_2:Yes, it was created in Russia by a man who almost never made any money from it but eventually he did in 1996. I must admit I had the tetris effect for a while after I played. I would see everything in blocks and a way to fit.	agent_1 likes video games. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['video games', 'movie', 'movie'].
12313	agent_1:I like Walt Disney, how about you. agent_2:Yes I like Walt Disney a lot. Did you hear about the Lion King remake that they're coming out with though? Is it live action or not? agent_1:I was a big Lion King fan, have you seen it? agent_2:No they haven't come out with the Remake yet. But I did see the stage show and I also saw a movie which are both great. Julie Taymor directed the Broadway musical by the way agent_1:They made it dubbed in zulu for african release, that was nice of them agent_2:Yes I agree. I also like how revolutionary Disney was with their use of multi-plane cameras, that really adds to an animated scene and they used it in Bambi agent_1:For sure, it is amazing what they can do. Frozen was a good song, ever seen it? agent_2:Yes I did like that movie. I think it was the first Disney movie to be directed by a woman.   agent_1:For sure, that is a good stat. They need more women directing disney movies  agent_2:Yes I think so. What do you think about the movie Big Hero 6? That was actually decent, it's not my favorite but it is impressive they used a 50,000 core computer to render it agent_1:Wow, I did not know. I liked that movie and it makes sense. agent_2:Did you ever see the movie Up by the way? Apparently it would take 9 million balloons to actually lift the house LOL that's insane agent_1:Lol, that would be so many balloons, and so much helium! People would be talking funny for days if they all popped. agent_2:Haha that's a good point. Do you think anyone has ever attached so many balloons to themselves that they floated away LOL agent_1:For sure! Do you have a favorite animal? agent_2:Yes my favorite animal is the dog! Dogs are so awesome and that they love humans makes me happy haha what about you agent_1:Me too. I love dogs so much! There are 20 quintillion animals on planet earth. So many! agent_2:That is a lot! What school is that you know how humans have a dominant side like you're right-handed or whatever? Apparently dogs have a dominant paw side too LOL	agent_1:Just like humans, that is awesome.

1701	agent_1:Are you a soccer or tennis fan? agent_2:Well I personally prefer tennis, but I also like lacrosse, did you hear about the spring all met boys lacrosse team? agent_1:No, what was that? agent_2:Well they want a lot of Awards this year, and I think they're going to do even better next year agent_1:I will have to follow them. Tennis is fun too. a black man won the us open in 1968 and no other black man has since then. That would be award worthy agent_2:Yes they should make a movie about him! it's interesting to that until 1978 you could use any object as a tennis racket, that sounds dangerous agent_1:That would be hilarious to see what some  people came up with. What would  you use? lol agent_2:I would use a rocket launcher LOL just kidding. do you watch soccer at all? Apparently soccer makes more than all other sports combined agent_1:Lol that would be perfect, no opponent means you  win everytime!  agent_2:That's a great point! Did you know that table tennis is the name of the actual sport, and that ping pong is only the name of the company that sells the table tennis equipment? agent_1:I did not know that, wow! Mind blown! Back to soccer, did you have a favorite team in the world cup? agent_2:No I don't. I really don't like soccer I think it's boring LOL it's weird to me that the Super Bowl is smaller than soccer's biggest events agent_1:it is boring, but it is kind of fun to watch one week per 4 years lol. I liked Brazil	agent_2:Well soccer is a good exercise though, apparently a player will run about 7 miles per game, that's good for burning calories	agent_1 likes sports. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'favorite sport', 'tennis'].
10667	agent_1:Winter is getting old.  I'm ready to see birds migrating back north from Mexico; that would be a welcome sight. agent_2:Yea birds are pretty interesting, i find their light weight skeleton fascinating  agent_1:It's hard to believe that their skeletons actually weigh less than their feathers with those hollow bones. agent_2:Yea, they are quite successful species with over ten thousand species currently living agent_1:I guess some in Australia can mimic lots of sounds like cameras and chainsaws.  Listening to them might be better than going to a Creed concert.  Some dissatisfied listeners once filed a lawsuit since a performance was so bad. agent_2:I don't blame them. The foo fighters once did a concert so loud it was recorded on New Zealand's seismic monitors agent_1:Wow, that is loud!  But I'll bet it was fun.  I've never seen them live, but I have been to a few good amphitheatre shows: John Mellencamp, Tome, Petty, and KISS were really good. agent_2:Apparently Deep Purple has the record for loudest concert, it left three audience members unconscious agent_1:Holy cow, that had to be something.  Those classic acts had it going on.  The Ramones toured almost nonstop for 20 years; that is commitment to the craft, no doubt. agent_2:That is impressive, they've must of made a lot of money but probably not as much Abba was offered to do a reunion tour, they turned down 1 billion dollars agent_1:I did not know that.  For that kind of money, I think I could put grudges or reservations aside.  You could buy a lot of tacos for 1 billion dollars. agent_2:Yea I never even thought Abba was that in demand to offer 1 billion to do 100 concerts agent_1:I think I would pass on that one.  I didn't even know they were still all around.  Fame can take a toll on performers; Linkin Park was so awesome, but their lead singer faced demons and committed suicide.  So sad. agent_2:Yea that is unfortunate. Do you follow world events much. In 2010 there was a global tiger summit that russia pledged 330 million dollars to agent_1:I like keeping up on politics, but I did not know that fact.  However, I heard once that they gave out phone chargers and thumb drives infected with trojan viruses at one G20 summit.  That seems to go against the very nature of a summit. agent_2:Yes but I guess security is lacking at a lot of summits, in 2007 a man dressed as Osama bin Laden was able to get pass security of the Apec summit agent_1:Really?  You would think that security might be a bit tighter at these things.  Especially with the heads of state from so many powerful countries there.  It's almost like inviting someone to harm world leaders.   agent_2:Yea but I guess security is hard to do with the increase in Summits since the end of the Cold War	agent_1:True, now there has been an increase in summit events since then, so it's probably harder to keep them all safe.  	agent_2 likes outdoor activities. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['outdoor activities', 'music', 'rock bands'].
11783	agent_1:Are you a Lady Gaga fan? agent_2:Yes, musically and as an actress. I just heard a new extended version of a star is born is coming out. I can't wait to see the extra footage. agent_1:I have not seen it at all but I am interested. It got a lot of acclaim. Do you know that Lady Gaga is the godmother of Elton John's son? agent_2:Yes, shes tweeted about him a lot. You should follow her on twitter she has well over 11 million followers and posts all kinds of neat stuff. agent_1:I just recently followed her so I missed a lot. Speaking of, did you also know that the LAPD asked her to tweet her followers about some upcoming roadwork? agent_2:I guess they have a lot less followers. Smart idea! She's come a long way since she was on boiling points. agent_1:I forgot that show existed. I had no idea she was on that. I'm sure she's a bit embarrassed about that now.  agent_2:Maybe, you know it's funny I love her music but she's not really what I'd consider typical to what I listen to. Then I find out her favorite band is Iron Maiden and it makes sense. agent_1:I didn't know about that either. I usually prefer rock as well but I'm not against some catchy pop here and there to get my day going or to work out to. It has it's place for sure.  agent_2:I just wish she'd tour more. I have seen a few of her concerts but there are not that many opportunties. agent_1:You would think she would since that's a lot of the income for singers now. Do you enjoy going to concerts? agent_2:Yes, how about you? I think Linkin Park is the band I've seen the most. They play a lot of shows. Or at least they did :( Sadly there will be no more. agent_1:I used to like it a lot but I don't enjoy the crowds quite as much anymore. I did hear that Linkin Park played 324 concerts in one year. That's insane! agent_2:Yeah I'm really going to miss Chester. They played some really great venues, I wish there were more dvds. In Croatia a roman amphitheater is still in use, I'd love to go there. agent_1:That would be an amazing place to attend a concert. The pictures, the sound, the memory. I would love to do that too.  agent_2:I'm glad I got to see Linkin Park so many times when I did, since you never know when it will be over. I'm sad I never got to see the Ramones though. Before my time. They played over 2000 shows! agent_1:I would have seen the Ramones. They have very catchy music and I'm not even a fan of much punk. I had no idea they played that many shows. I know they played at CBGB's a lot so I wonder how many of those were there and how many were tours.  agent_2:I think there used to be a sign at CBGB's how many times they played there. Of course like the Ramones that place is long gone now too. I'm glad Roger Waters still tours but it would be nice to see Pink Floyd again. agent_1:It's sad that it's gone. It was such a relic of a cultural movement. I would love to see Pink Floyd. Did you know that they filmed a concert with no audience?	agent_2:Yes in Pompeii! I have the DVD. I believe it was just to have a chance to play in that historic roman venue.	agent_1 likes travel. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['travel', 'music', 'Ramones'].

She is super-extra! agent_2:No I didnt catch that episode, so do you like Pop music? agent_1:I do like pop music. Did you know Ariana Grande got hit by a puck twice in one game? agent_2:I didn't know that, that is odd lol, twice in a game? she must have a puck magnet in her forehead. agent_1:Yeah, it just was on twitter or Apple news this past weekend. There's a picture of her sitting on a zamboni too! agent_2:I guess there's a lot of controversy because of that, do you like snakes? agent_1:No. I hate snakes. I mean irrational hate! Do you? agent_2:I have a healthy respect for them and would scream like a little girl if I ever saw one next to me lol, they are interesting animals though agent_1:My 7 year old asked if he could get one and I tried to act cool, like I wasn't completely afraid of the notion! I was cool as a cucumber... agent_2:And did you bought you r7 year old a snake lol? agent_1:Nope! He got a cat. And I hate that thing. It's the worst cat ever. He just scratches and pees everywhere. JERK! agent_2:I agree im more of a dog person myself, maybe a snake was a better choice I would be afraid but I wouldnt worry about scratches and pee agent_1:Yeah. She is going to a farm in the spring. That's not code. OUr friend has a farm and some barn cats so she will be relocated there. agent_2:I see, well interesting fact about snakes, sometimes they are born with two heads and both head end up fighting for food. agent_1:That's really weird. Bite the head to spite the stomach!"	agent_2:Yeah and also 70% of the snakes lay eggs others give live birth another surprising fact.	agent_1 likes hobby. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobby', 'pets', 'greeting'].
7168	agent_1:Hi! Are you familiar with Bad Times at the El Royale? I feel it basically defies expectations even though not all of its surprises are pleasant but there is satisfaction, however! agent_2:hi how are you? I have heard of it. it is a movie that came out recently, right? agent_1:Not too long ago and it's basically set in 1969 and is also kind of a B movie, black comedy and mystery! Drew Goddard directed it as well! agent_2:A B movie? Great! that sounds fun. low budget? doesnt take itself too seriously? agent_1:Exactly. So are you a horror fan in general? I watch horror films as a workout because you can burn over 180 calories just by watching them, surprisingly enough! agent_2:I thnk the first time it would burn that many, but the second time maybe not. not so scary.  agent_1:That is a good point. But you know what else is crazy, they say if you view abstract art after watching a horror film, you'll enjoy it a lot more! I need to try that! agent_2:How does that even work? is your brain more active? more emotionally sensitive? agent_1:I would imagine so. It's so weird, isn't it? I tell you what else is weird, Stephen King once said Bambi was the first horror movie he watched. Can you believe that? He definitely has a twisted mind, doesn't he? agent_2:He probably was traumatized by that disney flick and ended up fascinated with the macabre.	agent_1:Agreed! You know what else gets me? Danny from The Shining didn't actually know he was acting in a horror movie until years later.

You Tube is the second largets search engine nowadays agent_2:I'm not surprise. At one point, it consumed as much bandwidth as the entire internet in 2000. agent_1:Yeah that is crazy. Bieber's Baby song seems to be the most disliked video in there. Poor guy agent_2:I don't feel as badly for him as I do for the three guys who created YouTube. Evidently, Google bought it for only 1.65 billion dollars over a decade ago. I feel like it's probably worth way more now! agent_1:I bet it is for sure. Have you heard of Bluetube? agent_2:I haven't.

A pajama party and a live satirical operetta with talented musician clowns. that is something else agent_1:The use of a pillow pit might be a little bit disturbing for some! agent_2:It might. And it is nice they start with sweet dreams from Eurythmics agent_1:live players doing popular music like Dream On as part of the show is surprising!	agent_2:They play with music and even with toys.

Did You hear that Bruce lee was also a great dancer and he won the hong kong cha-cha championship in 1958 ? agent_2:I did hear that.  Emilia clarke did the funky chicken and robot dance at the audition for daenerys targaryen. agent_1:I am such a big fan of hers!  agent_2:Did you know that there was an episode of mr. rogers where he learned to breakdance agent_1:I would love to see that. Did You see a movie about him ? I've heard it's good. agent_2:No, I haven't seen it but watched his show growing up. agent_1:I'm from Poland and I got here like 16 years ago... I've never seen it but I admire who he is and what he did... agent_2:That's cool.  I've never been to Poland.  There are ballet slippers that make drawings from the dancer's movements agent_1:Probably looks like a 2year old drawing :) agent_2:Probably, the first moonwalk ever recorded was performed by tap dancer bill bailey in 1955! agent_1:...so it's not MJ who invented it ? agent_2:I guess not.  He must have taken it and run with it though....and screamed also agent_1:lol ;) but that walk got famous just because Michael ;) 	agent_2:Absolutely it did.

1510	agent_1:Hello, do you like Star Wars? agent_2:I don't really though I do respect it as a franchise. How about you? agent_1:Yeah I like it. Lucas' wife made such changes to the script that she won the Academy Award agent_2:Star Wars is the second highest grossing film series of all time. It's spawned into a bunch of other media like books, video games, theme parks. agent_1:Yeah it has certainly taken over everything. It was even dubbed in Navajo agent_2:Cool! James Cameron decided to quit being a truck driver so that he could enter the film industry after watching Star Wars. I guess that was the right decision. agent_1:Oh for sure it was, the guy is a legend now. James Earl Jones got only $7500 recording Darth Vader's lines agent_2:Crazy! Fox thought Star Wars was going to flop and agreed to George Lucas's proposition to forgo an extra $500K directing fee so that he could keep licensing and merchandising rights. Their decision cost them billions of dollars agent_1:Yeah and at the same time made Lucas a billionaire. He just had a lot of confidence in his work agent_2:Yeah, in 2018 the whole Star Wars franchise was estimated at $65 billion agent_1:That is insane. Do you watch the Academy Awards? agent_2:No, I don't. How about you? agent_1:I watch it sometimes. Did you know Daniel Day-Lewis has won the Oscar 3 times? agent_2:I am not sure I even know who he is. Good for him. John Williams has been nominated for more Oscars than anyone besides Walt Disney. agent_1:Yeah Disney is going to be hard to reach by anyone else with 22 Oscars agent_2:He got a special Oscar in 1938 for snow white that had a regular sized statuette and seven miniature oscars.  agent_1:That is amazing. Eminem has more Oscars than Leonardo DiCaprio and some other big names.  agent_2:Speaking of Oscars, Kelly Marie Tran went to them. She is the first non white woman in Star Wars leading role. agent_1:That is amazing. Have you seen the movie Blazing Saddles? agent_2:I have not seen it.

Tom hanks is the highest box office star! agent_2:I love him, he's such a versatile actor and has played in some of my favorite movies.  Did you know Disney thought about shutting down their studio after Sleeping beauty flopped at the box office? agent_1:Yikes, was it that bad?  I have only seen it like once or twice lol.  Glad they didnt, they have come out with some really good stuff agent_2:I know right?  I loved it as a kid, I didn't think it was that bad.  You know I knew Silence of The Lambs made lots of money at the box office, but I didn't realize it came out on Valentine's day in 1991.  Did you? agent_1:Yeah, so romantic right!  lol that was a great movie,  kinda ironic about the valentines day thing lol agent_2:Did you watch the Avengers: Infinity Wars movie ? agent_1:Yes, I did,  great movie as well,  I hear it was filmed in all imax cameras!  agent_2:I loved it too!  Can't wait for the next one, I'll probably cry all over again, when I see who all died at the end of the movie. agent_1:Yeah coming out next month I think.  It was pretty sad at the end.  Bring tissue this time! agent_2:Thanos sucks!  Anyway, I haven't seen RBG, have you? agent_1:What is that? agent_2:Movie about the life of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

Did you know Germany is the first country in the world to give animals legal rights? agent_1:Yeah I think the kimodo dragon actually has its own island too lol I didnt know that,  what rights are those? agent_2:Yes, I think the do have an island. As for the legal rights, I'm not entirely sure but pretty much what humans have. agent_1:I see.  Did you know dogs have 12 blood types?   agent_2:No, I had no idea. That is interesting.

How is that different from a movie? agent_2:You interact with it.  In fact if you ignore it, it taunts you.  Intruders invade and all kinds of things happen.  agent_1:That sounds like a great way to have fun. I bet the story line is pretty good too. You don't kill things or earn points. Is it popular? agent_2:I would guess so, it's on many different consoles. In certain parts of the story there are minefields.  agent_1:I guess I should look into this. Do you use Playstation? agent_2:No.  The most significant thing is that it can have different endings.  agent_1:I don't really play video games much anymore. Do you? Do you use computers much? I do. agent_2:I use computers a lot.  Did you know Windows 95 was the 2nd most installed SW in 1995? agent_1:W95 was huge for its time. It got delayed several times, but it was a big jump for Microsoft. I used it a lot myself. agent_2:Me too.  The first computer algorithm was written by a woman named Ada.  I wonder if that's where the name ADA came from in computing. agent_1:Yes, I believe so. There was a programming language called ADA. I never used it. She was very bright. agent_2:That's what I was saying.  It came from Pascal.  Bell distributed a manual cardboard computer to HS students in 1968 to teach them how that works.  I'd be interested in seeing that. agent_1:I see. Pascal and ADA are related languages. Is it in use now? I wouldn't expect so. agent_2:If I remember right, the gov't was pushing ADA.  There's probably a lot of legacy systems with it.  Did you know the first YouTube video was some dude talking about an elephant...  agent_1:An elephant? Not ADA? LOL. I guess that makes sense. The first upload was probably pretty basic. agent_2:Now there are 79 full episodes of ""The Joy of Painting"" with Bob Ross.  "	agent_1:Yes, that man is a legend!

You poop more often ? I don't know ;) agent_1:Ha, that or have a heart attack, no seriously, you burn 180 calories watching a horror movie, wonder what other types of cinema burn? agent_2:I mean if the movie really scares You, than maybe, but what if You just like the story, but it's no longer scary for You, because You've seen it all ? ;) agent_1:I can't imagine not being scared watching a horror movie, thats why I like other forms of cinema.  Do you know cinematogrrpahy is the science of motion picture photography and important to all types of movies? agent_2:well sure, it's just hundreds of pictures with sound in the background ;) agent_1:The art is making them look good with the right music and sound to tell a story.  Do youknow the guy who pioneered the use of the wide angle lens won aan oscar but was not a citizen until '43 and illegally married a white woman because he was Chinese American, we have done some stupid things in our past treatment of others. agent_2:I mean I wouldn't say it's stupid... if he was here illegally, that means he broke the law... there was no legal way to get here ? agent_1:He was her and became a citizen, the law he broke was marrying a white woman because he was asian. That is crazy. agent_2:ahhh, I did not get that. So he came it legally ? and he couldn't marry white woman ? Was that a law ? What year was that ?? agent_1:His marriage did not become legal until 1948, prior to that it was considered illegal.  No woman has every been nominated for best cinematography Oscars either, so I guess there are still some issues. agent_2:There will always be issues with race... but we're getting there... agent_1:I like the fantasy escape from all of our problems we find at the box office.  I guess others do to since Tom Hanks has made over 8.5 billion. agent_2:I mean good for him, he was always very talented, but honestly, I don't remember seeing any new movie with him, do You ? agent_1:I haven't seen anything new in a long time,  I did love Forest Gump, and You've got Mail though.  I really like Disney movies, do you know Sleeping Beauty was such a failure they considered closing down. agent_2:lol, no I didn't know that. I have a beef with Disney thou... I loved it when I was a kid, but since they've destroyed Star Wars... they're dead to me ;) agent_1:I prefer the original 3 from my childhood in the 70's.  Hopefully they learn something from their flops like Treasure planet, not that was a waste of money. agent_2:yes. just because its Disney and it has to be ok for kids ? make a division for adults and start making decent movies... You have the budget, technicians... nothing would stop them... agent_1:I think they have a separate division but can't remember what it is called.  I'm not sure I'd like to see the name Disney on a film like Silence of the Lambs though. agent_2:Why not... it was a great movie. Classic. but I see what You 're saying. No I mean make movies like Star Wars for a little bit mature audience... don't focus on 6year olds because there are millions of 60 year old wanted to see how the story continues... agent_1:We never get to see the rebuilding of the galaxy and having Leia and Han's son kill Han and be bad was a stupid thing to do. agent_2:it was a poor choice yes. and the way they showed Luke was not to my liking either... agent_1:They made him seem like he regressed into some kind of whiney baby, at his age and experience he should be evolving more like Ben Kenobi or even Yoda, not woah is me I need a xanex Luke agent_2:That's my point exactly ! He was Vader's son ! Son of a person born out of force.. in my mind, he should be leading everybody to defeat Siths OR maybe share the faith of his father and go the the dark side... but not this... agent_1:It was so frustrating and annoying.  Vader's turn to the bright side at the end should have affirmed him and gave him deterination to continue, and why have Han's son be so bad, that is just pointless,  I guess they couldn't think of a bad guy. agent_2:I think they are preparing a twist of action nobody is suspecting but I think it's in a bad taste. I personally think Han Solo lives ;) agent_1:I won't even pay to see the rest of them,  the cinematography is great though. agent_2:Absolutely ;) no argument here ;) agent_1:If I was a better cinematographer, I'd make my own movies, but thats not in the cards.  Its been nice visiting with you."	agent_2:Same here, thank You so much for fun conversation ! ;)	agent_1 likes hobbies. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobbies', 'movie', 'movie'].
1106	agent_1:No. I think it's so interesting that the Republican Party is referred to as the Grand old party. agent_2:I agree.  I wonder why they gave themselves that moniker.   agent_1:Yeah I'm not sure. But every US president with a beard has been Republican. agent_2:True.  I also heard that Hillary Clinton was president of the young republicans when she was in college. agent_1:Oh that's interesting especially given the fact that she just ran Democrat. The red and blue colors for Republicans and Democrats only started in 2000. agent_2:That really got me.  I thought they were always around representing the parties.   agent_1:Yeah me too but it sounds like they used to use animals more. Truman seem to take that very seriously especially at Disneyland. agent_2:I heard... poor Dumbo.  He probably didnt even understand. agent_1:Ha ha yeah I bet he was so confused. It's funny to think that ride has been around since 1957. agent_2:It really is, it was my favorite as a kid, much to the detriment of my parents.  LOL agent_1:Haha thats funny.

You dont watch it? agent_1:No, but I really want to. I haven't even bought cable TV. I have watched Game of Thrones at friends' houses, though. agent_2:Oh thats good,  you should catch up the last season is coming out in april and thats it the show will be done.  agent_1:I really need to catch up on it. I also have no idea what's going on this year with the World Series Baseball. agent_2:The actress that plays Arya actually has never been in anything before.  what a break!  First time acting and gets Game of Thrones! agent_1:Is Arya the one that has all the gorgeous fierce dragons on Game of Thrones? agent_2:No.  Arya is the little girl,  she looks like a boy,  on purpose.  agent_1:I heard that Ireland finances the Game of Throne series because it's filmed there and they get a good boost of tourism through that. Sounds good to me! agent_2:Yes, My aunt and cousin went to visit it last summer,  the pics were amazing! agent_1:Did you know that Charlie Chaplin's Granddaughter plays Talisa Maegyr in the Game of Thrones? I wonder if she has many lines? agent_2:I did know that but I dont recognize the name at all so I guess she is not a main character.  agent_1:Do they have other cool creatures in the Game of Thrones show besides dragons? I'd love to see unicorns and other things too! agent_2:Giant wolves that are called Direwolvles,  White walkers (like dead zombies but frozen one),  Giants.   agent_1:WOW! Sounds so cool! They have Dire Wolves in this card game called Magic the Gathering. Definitely have giants in that game too.  agent_2:Oh ok,  I have heard of that game.  Its a card game?	agent_1:Yes. I mostly like the artwork on the cards. It's definitely better than watching the World Series baseball.

7928	agent_1:Do you like baseball? agent_2:Yeah, I'm a Royals fan. I thought it funny that managers wear unis because they can play.  agent_1:Yeah, I never thought that was possible, I think the whole team has to get injured first though agent_2:Can you imagine someone like Tommy Lasorda playing.  It would be like Babe Ruth getting caught stealing in the 1926 World Series.  agent_1:Yeah I can imagine the scenario, Babe Ruth sure was  a great player, too bad his team lost that game back in 1926 agent_2:Yep.  Funny, kickball is called soccer-baseball in Canada.  agent_1:I see, so do you like to watch series? have you watched Game of Thrones before? agent_2:Yes and yes... I love GoT, it's a guilty pleasure of mine.  I was surprised to learn that Harry Lloyd was a relative of Charles Dickens.  Love Charles Dickens... agent_1:That is a suprising fact are they really related? guess theres no doubt where his talent comes from, you know the series are financed in part by Ireland agent_2:I heard that.  There are more famous connections too.  Talisa is the granddaughter of Talisa.  Wow.   agent_1:I wonder if they knew these facts when they casted the actors of the show, it seems like there's a lot of interesting facts behind the series agent_2:I'm sure they let it slip out during the casting.  GoT now has spin offs, a Nat'l Geo show called Game of Lions where lions are like GoT characters.  agent_1:Havent seen that one but sounds like an interesting show for sure, Game of Lions, I wonder how its similar to the series agent_2:I can't imagine costuming lions like that.  Can you believe the women's World Cup had better ratings than the World Series in the U.S.? agent_1:It did? maybe because the womens team is pretty good, they always land in a good spot, still, its surprising as baseball is one of the most popular games in America agent_2:Yeah, I guess baseball is so popular in Japan that they were surprised to find out it's America's national pastime.  agent_1:Yes Japan has a lot of fans indeed, do you know who the Chicago Cubs are? agent_2:Yeah, until they won in 2016, the Ottoman Empire was still in existence the last time they won the World Series.  agent_1:I heard they had a big drought before that, its strange how the team was the first to win the series back to back agent_2:It was long for sure.  I was glad to see them beat the Indians in 2016.  It was like that had a curse or something like in GoT.  	agent_1:Yeah it sure seemed that way, its a good thing the curse got lift.	agent_2 likes fantasy. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['fantasy', 'sports', 'TV shows'].
7896	agent_1:Hi, do you like baseball? agent_2:Yes, I grew up in St. Louis in the 70's so I used to love the Cardinals, KC in the 90-00's so a big Royals fan and I've been in Boston for 4 years so I have enjoyed local baseball in all three towns. Are you a fan?  I knew that managers wear uniforms in the dugout because they can technically play and there were player-managers in the old days, but when the last time a manager actually played in a game? agent_1:Hi, yes I like baseball , and sports in general....and is true I have never seen a manager playing!! but is good they are ready in case they are needed! agent_2:It's funny baseball is so popular in Japan that many fans don't know it was America's pastime. I guess they forgot WW II, it was brought there by occupying US Troops after Japan surrendered.  agent_1:Wow that is impressive, they kind of ignored how americans feel about baseball.. i think the Chicago cubs have not won in a long time! agent_2:Yes, first team to win back-to-back World Series and not another one for 108 years (Ottoman Empire was still in existence when they last won a World Series?), that ironic. As a St. Louis fan growing up I did go to quite a few games at Wrigley Field along the way before they  had lights which made a good afternoon. As I have a lot of Cub fan friends that World Series win was quite something, though many of them felt relief instead of happiness after the win. agent_1:That is really cool history right there. Would be nice to see a win from the cubs again. Do you know what a very lucky man found in his grandfather's attic? agent_2:You mean the $3 Million dollar baseball card collection? Yes, I collected and bought some rare cards at a shop and know have no idea where they album are, a luck garbage collector might have found them when my mom cleaned out the attic long after I moved out. Being in Red Sox land, there's always the ghost of Babe Ruth, when you look at the big guy he doesn't look fleet of foot, bunny he lost the '26 World series getting caught trying to steal home down by one run. Funny thought, though I doubt Yankee fans thought that , that year. agent_1:wow, you collected those too!  I am amazed those cards lasted hidden since the 1940's!!	agent_2:Yes, I think every kid 1940-19808 probably did. You see where in the '92 World Series the US Marine Corp color guard carried the flag upside down, I wonder if that was planned to psyche them out or distract them from the game plan or totally an accident?	agent_1 likes sports. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'history', 'fate card'].

I have yet to see her in that movie, I really want to though.  agent_2:Me too.

Are you familiar with K-pop? agent_2:I'm kind of familiar with it. agent_1:Me too. There are several songs that stick in my head It's catchy. There is a K-pop band called Moranbong Band that is the most popular music group in the country. I am not familiar with their music.  agent_2:I've never heard of them before. I heard that rejection letters from Sub Pop Records to aspiring artists start with ""Dear loser."" That's kind of disheartening. agent_1:Wow! I new they were an edgy company but that's harsh. Did you know that Ricky Gervais was a pop singer in the 80's? I cannot picture that. "	agent_2:I've heard that and I can't believe it.

The actors in the exorcist never knew that they were making a horror film. lol agent_1:It's crazy, I think a lot of people are like that in real life too, I wish more people would realize that it could be us like that. Isn't it nuts that a single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving reality and fantasy?  agent_2:Thats deep. People could learn more about this at an actual university agent_1:They could, too bad not everyone has access to a university though, would help everyone out a lot if it was more profitable, the inequality gap in the US is getting ridiculous! agent_2:Did you ever see Thor that came out in 2011 ? agent_1:I did, I remember watching it in the movie theater, it's the fourth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Loki seems like a bad guy you can root for, or am I mistaken? agent_2:I have never seen it.

It looks like it can be a lot of fun!  I've heard though that the longest match in history was 11 hours long and lasted over 3 days.  That i'm not so sure i would like. agent_1:That is a really long game, they must have been exhausted and the fans bored out already.  agent_2:Probably so.  But tennis is very competitive so the players though exhausted most likely kept fighting. agent_1:Do you like polo shirts? cool fact about them but they were actually created by a tennis player agent_2:I do and I had no idea about that!

Do you know why managers wear uniforms? agent_2:Yep, because they are technically able to play for their team if the need arises. I don't recall ever seeing one play though. agent_1:That's correct. I've never seen it happen either.  agent_2:I've heard that up from 1981 until 2005 a married couple actually scheduled all 2,430 major league games played each year. agent_1:Wow! That's some serious devotion to the game.  agent_2:Yeah it is. I find it fascinating that baseball is so popular in Japan. I remember watching games when I was stationed there and the crowds were amazing, even for small local games. agent_1:I had heard that it was so huge over there that they are surprised that it is our past time.  agent_2:Did you ever collect baseball cards? agent_1:I did not. How about you? agent_2:I collected them with my dad when I was a kid. I wish I could have found a collection like this one man did. He found three million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfather's attic. They had been hidden since the 1940s. agent_1:Wow! That's amazing.

That seems like an overly complicated name.  agent_2:Poor Canada though, in the 1992 World Series, Marine Corps color guard carried the Canadian Flag into the stadium upside down. agent_1:Oh no!

Were you a subscriber even back when their whole business model was about DVD rental by mail and not an online platform? agent_2:I was! I think it was in 2007 when they started adding streaming features. agent_1:It's interesting to think how differently the company could have been if decisions played out differently. Like Blockbuster declining to buy them many times, and now they're worth many times over. agent_2:Exactly! A purchase of $50 million that is now worth $2 billion. That is just CRAZY! agent_1:And I feel like that doesn't even big to desribe how huge Netflix is still. Netflix accounts for a third of ALL bandwith in North America from 9pm to 12 am! agent_2:Which is honestly just nuts. And when you combine Netflix and youtube, it's half of the peak internet traffic in North America alone!	agent_1:I was surprised to learn recently though, that despite how huge their online platform is, they still do DVD rentals!

We like to grill a lot outside, which helps not make our home more hot. agent_2:Grilling out is the best to help with the heat inside the house. If I have to cook in the house i do it early in the morning before it gets too hot. agent_1:Yes that's another great idea. We also sometimes eat out if it is way too hot, or eating something like salads or cereal. Where we aren't using heat at all. agent_2:That is a great idea. We tend to eat leftovers too and just use the micorwave. agent_1:The microwave is great and fast, I agree. Making Icecream is a great way to cool down when it gets too hot. We also tend to use box fans. agent_2:We use a fan for sure. Also started using like a slow cooker or toaster oven not as hot and now can fit up to a whole chicken. agent_1:Great appliances help to cook! We love our air-fryer. Though it tends to eat up the area some, so we open the doors and dim the lights to help with the heat. agent_2:I heard some people turn their wrist upside down  to get their blood flowing to stay cool. agent_1:Wow great information, I will have to try that sometime. Do you like to eat fish or even go fishing? agent_2:I love to fish. the oldest goldfish lived to be 43 years old agent_1:Wow that is a long life for a goldfish! I like to go crabbing too. I heard the seahorse is the only fish with a neck, I agent_2:THere was a koi fish that lived 226 years agent_1:Whoa! That is crazy to know and interesting. I know there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal. agent_2:Cool the barreleye fish has a transparent head.	agent_1:Awesome.

8938	"agent_1:Hi there. Do you enjoy to travel? I love visiting distant geographical locations! agent_2:Yes, I was actually in Paris last week. Do you travel? I was surprised there a website for people with couches to crash on, wish I knew it last week I had a long layover. agent_1:Whoa that's awesome! Did you eat crepes? I want to go to Iceland but it sounds like the public transport isn't great-will probably rent a car. agent_2:No crepes, I did have snails which I like. I've had a layover in Iceland, it looks like the moon. Flying it a lot of volcanic lava flows turned to rock. Did you know about that gnome stealing thing, take a picture, then return? That a lot of work. agent_1:Haha yeah I heard about that. Does sound like a lot of work. Did you fly any domestic flights in Iceland? That seems like a good way to get around there. agent_2:No, Iceland Air is cheapest to Sweden, I work there a couple times a year. I'm on the east coast so it's a quick flight though. Do you like fiction, a reader? That how I bide my time. agent_1:Awesome lucky. Yeah fiction is entertaining. I like it because it is not based strictly on history or fact. agent_2:Yes, I'm not much on Science Fiction, more literary fiction. I didn't know Isaac Asimov coined ""robotics"" I have friends who  love him and Sci Fi. What genre do you like? agent_1:Oh nice good genre. I like fiction as well. Edgar Allen Poe's first developed cyborg's in fiction which is pretty cool.  agent_2:Yes and Poe developed the detective genre I read too. I read War and Peace, but the Smash Bros is 4 million words even longer? That would take some time. agent_1:Wow. Is War and Peace good? I know Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction but I have never read his text. agent_2:Yes, I liked it but it's a complex novel. Yes, I read Caesar history of the Gallic Wars. Pretty interesting in light of France now. Do you like music, you see where the highest violin bow price sold for $182,000 wow, that quite expensive per pound. agent_1:You have read a lot I'm impressed. I love music and sometimes classical. Hard to believe a violin sold for that. Hopefully it wasn't the one made out of stone! agent_2:Gold and tortoiseshell i read, I feel sorry for the turtle. You like fiddle or violin more? Country or classic as the instrument is the same. agent_1:Wow. Interesting. I like the fiddle because I prefer country music. A famous scientist who played the violin was Albert Einstein. agent_2:Interesting, complex man. Did you know they have to play and ""break-in"" a violin? That makes sense though interesting it changes the cellulose molecules in the body. agent_1:Kind of like a shoe? Very interesting. It is also good for the small muscles and nerves of the arms and hands. Just ask Larry Fine from the Three stooges! agent_2:That funny, yes, you like me must have a few years on you. My kids don't know who the Three Stoogies are. Have you traveled much? Back to that, you see where the airlines make the walk longer instead of baggage return quicker to cut complaints. That not good to me. agent_1:Yes I have lived in both Spain and Australia. I actually didn't hear about that. Typically airplane if is the most efficient method of travel when compared with everything else so I don't see why they make people walk longer.  agent_2:Nice, my son went to school a summer in Spain. He loved it. I guess the exercise you get on the longer walk is good. Did you know they fly 10% slower to save fuel relative to the 60's, that would be fine but the food is worse than the 60's too."	agent_1:Yeah good point.

It's estimated that over 1.5 million living animal species have been described. agent_1:That is a lot. What is your favorite animal? agent_2:Hahah my favorite animals are frogs.  Been fascinated with them ever since I was a kid for some reason. agent_1:Interesting! Did you know under provisions of the 1912 Scottish protection of animals act the lochness monster is a protected species? hahaha agent_2:That's funny!  The Netherlands is constructing special bridges for wildlife in order to connect habitats and keep animals from being hit by cars.  That's a good idea.  In the fall where I live the roads are peppered with dead animals.  I think they try to get on the roads to get warm at night and that's when they get hit. agent_1:Intriguing! Crazy that humans have lost their body hair 240,000 years ago. agent_2:Interesting. lol  There's a lawyer in Switzerland who represents animals in court.  That's a different kind of lawyer job. agent_1:So weird. I would sue humans if I were an animal. agent_2:lol  yes.  They sure have gotten the short end of the stick that's for sure.  Do you like horses?  I had them while growing up. agent_1:I love horses. Never had one. I heard humans domesticated horses around 4000 bc. agent_2:I believe it.  95 percent of all modern thoroughbred racehorses can trace their Y chomosome to one horse named Darley Arabian.  	agent_1:Interesting!

Did you know the brand ZARA banned the use of animal after an investigation? agent_2:Hello - I did not know that.  agent_1:They were found to throw goats, I understand why people were shocked  agent_2:That's crazy. Did you know pilgrim clothing was full of color? agent_1:Thats so interesting also, I heard they only wore black on special occasions, only humans wear clothing also  agent_2:Yes I saw that as well. There's a store in Alabama that only sells clothes, cameras, etc. that are found in unclaimed baggage.  agent_1:Normally bigger corporations have enough power to make decisions like that. But that's not ethical is it  agent_2:Yea I don't think that's ethical either. agent_1:I think it has a clear link with the use of animals by many companies.... Using fur without consent kinda resembles using unclaimed baggage agent_2:Yea I think so too. 	agent_1:Germany was the first country to give rights to animals do you agree with that? 	agent_2 likes pets. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['pets', 'environment', 'linking animal welfare with fur industry'].

It is not my first choice for a genera but I enjoy all fantasy.  agent_1:yeah , me either but is it in the reading list of three out of five us military branches agent_2:I don't think I would like a military recommended novel which would focus on battle strategies. I prefer Harry Potter. agent_1:nice, that is a good one. did you know the actor who play malfoy was caught trying to steal the wand? agent_2:I would hope they would let him have the wand anyway. I would imagine those actors deserve the memorabilia.  agent_1:i think so too. when daniel won the part of harry potter, do you know what his reward was? agent_2:I think his parents let him watch Faulty Towers. I am only vaguely familiar with the TV show but I would imagine it is still a fun classic show in the UK. agent_1:yeah and he must have been so happy to be able to do that agent_2:Yes, I am sure he is very grateful for being able to be apart of the movies. The Lord of the Rings films came out during that time and I always though he would also make a great Frodo. agent_1:ohh yeah that is true. do you know where hogwarts is located? agent_2:Yes, Hogwarts is in Scotland. agent_1:yeah, many people think it is in England actually agent_2:I is a very English novel so I can imagine why people would think it was located there, not as English as Tolkien and CS Lewis novels.  agent_1:true. the character of troll was actually named harry potter back in the day agent_2:I think you are confusing the Lord of the Rings with the unauthorized harry potter sequel. agent_1:maybe. do you read wikipedia much?	agent_2:Yes, I like to check on the background of artists but I worry it is not always accurate so I just use it for more common information.	agent_1 likes music. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'books', 'TV shows'].

Surprised I haven't heard of it agent_1:Wow did you know that Astronauts can vote from space.  agent_2:That is so cool. Not all men in the uk had the vote until 1918. agent_1:Every US president with a beard has been a republican.  agent_2:Thats funny. It should be mandatory to have a beard if youre a president! Ha agent_1:Right! The use of red and blue for Dems and Repu only started in 2000. I would have thought it was longer.  agent_2:Right! I thought it would have been more than 19 years! agent_1:The toy industry gets involved before the beginning of the production of a movie according to disney. agent_2:And the development of the Disney film wreck it ralph started in the late 80's. agent_1:Wow spanning nearly 3 decades with four working titles.  agent_2:Just remarkable. I cant believe Frozen was the first animated Disney film directed by a woman. agent_1:I know and that cartoon practically took over my life. agent_2:Impressive! Frozen was a very good movie in my opinion. agent_1:I think so to but you know the kids. it was a running dialogue at my house for what seemed like forever.  agent_2:Thats hilarious! Did you watch pirates of the Caribbean? agent_1:I did all of them. which was your favorite? agent_2:I liked the first one. Did you know those movies earned over $1 billion in worldwide box office gross? agent_1:Wow i did not know that.

I love how it maintained its core essence, yet amalgamated with local musical culture to generate countless distinct styles agent_2:Yes. I listen to it every night when I eat dinner. I have really gotten into Modal jazz. Most people like Jazz-rock, but I'm more of a 1950's guy. agent_1:I think all you mentioned are great, but personally I enjoy how cool jazz has developed agent_2:Are there any particular cool jazz groups you like? agent_1:Not in particular, but I do enjoy the calmer smoother sounds and linear melodic lines. Looking at jazz overall, my favorite probably would be frank sinatra agent_2:Kanye West often compares himself as the modern day Frank Sinatra. agent_1:I will admit both made their mark on music, but I like Sinatra more agent_2:Do you see yourself jealous of Kanye's success? I sometimes do. He has Kim Kardashian, hot and a money maker. agent_1:Well I won't deny I would desire money and success, however, their lives of living under the microscope and being stalked by paparazzi sounds too stressful agent_2:Even if you get all the tea's in the world? I guess it's bad for their children who have to be subjected to the awful names and filmed. I can't believe they named their child Chicago. agent_1:I don't think that is too bad. I know a family whose last name is trout so the father named his sons red and brown agent_2:Were their English limited or do they have some psychological problems...? Do they not understand the damage they can cause the children? These odd baby names, although originated from somewhere is really bad for the kids. agent_1:They said that it was terrible when young, but very helpful when they became adults since everyone remembered them positively. I think it's better than hashtag agent_2:I guess so. The kid can build character based on these names/nick names.	agent_1:There are also a lot of people trying to name their children after celebrities or characters in films like rocky 	agent_2 likes family. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['family', 'music', 'jazz music'].

What about you? agent_2:i dont like snakes but i dont hate. they are to be respected. they are part of nature agent_1:There is a genus of flying snakes! Nope! agent_2:That would be a hard no for me too. dang nature why you so scary LOL Crocodiles are more closely related to birds than they are to snakes and lizards. i guess i could move to australia agent_1:Australia's got crazy too! I remember a story of huge birds dropping dead out of the sky. Or maybe they were bats. Anyways, huge flying things falling from the sky! agent_2:yeah, lots of scary things there. crocodiles are pretty scary, but they are not related snakes LOL agent_1:Humans are not the only ones afraid of snakes. Monekys are too! agent_2:monkeys are smart, they know what is dangerous! i bet a lot of creatures are afraid  of snakes. agent_1:I wonder if they can tell the difference between snakes and legless lizards. agent_2:i bet they dont care. they fear anything that is close. i know i would! by the way, do you go to concerts much?	agent_1:I do.

I just do not have that kind that the russians made that runs on water agent_1:The water computer sounds alien, like something that Elon Musk would create. I wonder how fast that darn thing ran. As fast as Windows 8 maybe. agent_2:I am not sure since it was also a very long time ago, in 1936. agent_1:1936. That was a great year for water computers. Since then, not so good. I expected the Russians to make one that ran on vodka, but then again, vodka is too precious for computers. WOuld you upload your mind to a computer? If it ran on vodka, I would. agent_2:No I do not think so but it seems transhumanists are trying to do that. Curious to see if they succeed agent_1:If they succeed, they will have long boring lives. They will spend their time chatting on the Internet for cash to buy upgrades. agent_2:That sounds very probable. DO you have a PC or an Apple computer? agent_1:I have a PC. I have used Apple stuff though. You? Playstation? agent_2:Yeah I have an Apple so I guess good thing that I am not a smoker so as not to void the warranty agent_1:What about vaping though? Is that a problem? Then Apple would lose like 90% of their hipster customers! agent_2:Yeah, right? Do you watch youtube on your computer? agent_1:I sometimes watch YouTube to catch up on news and documentaries. You? agent_2:Yeah me too. It is the second largest search engine now on the internet agent_1:People are addicted to them vids! The kids can't enough of 'em!

Donald Trump? agent_2:Actually is it Justin Bieber, his song Baby agent_1:The Bieb! That figures. The guy bothers a lot of people. He's rich, he doesn't care.

I also didn't know that the Prime Minister selects and then can dismiss members of the cabinet. I always wondered what they did	agent_1:It's a little strange, isn't it?

4628	agent_1:Hello, do you follow the government? agent_2:A little bit, they own almost all of Nevada.  agent_1:Yep, they own 86% of the state which is crazy. agent_2:They did test a lot of nuclear bombs there, so I don't think anyone would want those areas.  agent_1:Very good point. Did you know Wikileaks published the government's plan to shutdown Wikileaks? agent_2:No, but it is seems logical given the nature of government and Wikileak's nature to publish them.   agent_1:True. A man in France once impersonated a government official and was able to sell the Eiffel Tower twice.  agent_2:Yeah, I feel a little bad for the people that fell for it, especially the first one, he was so ashamed that he did not called to police.  agent_1:Me too. The Norwegian government once gave $1 billion to help save the Amazon rainforest.  agent_2:Do you think they will succeed ? I hope so.  agent_1:I hope so too. Do you know much about Einstein? agent_2:I know he was a scientist. Is he German ? agent_1:Yep, he was German. He was once asked to be the president of Israel.  agent_2:Why would they ask him to be president of Israel ? He must have made a ton of money with all those posters with his face.  agent_1:Not really sure. I also saw he was a member of the NAACP. agent_2:So he was actively for civics right, he seems a good man but a quirky one I have heard that he wrote something and put it is a time capsule that will be opened in 6939.   agent_1:He was a good man and very smart. That's cool about the time capsule. Did you know he would charge $1 for his autograph? agent_2:That is a lot for the time, what did he do with the money ? agent_1:Not really sure lol. Seems a little bizarre. It was good chatting with you! agent_2:Good, but there are other interesting scientists to talk about like the emperor of Japan who is also a scientist. 	agent_1:That's good.

11099	"agent_1:How does America make collective decisions.  By voting.   agent_2:Do you know the difference between the United States Senate and House of Representatives? agent_1:One difference is 2 per state for the Senate while the House has 435 districts.  Those who are elected call the people who are represented ""constituents"" agent_2:Yes, and the Senate is considered more prestigious  and more deliberative. They're both important in for presidential votes, I think. agent_1:Yes.   The senate has certain rules where 60 votes are required for many bills.  I think that forces more deliberatioin.  They used the same gavel for 155 years until Richard Nixon cracked it. agent_2:The only fun think I've learned about the Senate is that they started the candy desk tradition. I remember my teachers always had candy drawers in their desks. agent_1:I have one in my office too.  One needs supplements if your blood sugar drops for no good reason.  Apparently Pennsylvania is the source of the candy right now. agent_2:Was that because of the Hershey factory there? Did you know they let astronauts vote from outer space? I think that's a good thing. agent_1:The astronaut voting sends a strong message about how important voting is.  I like that too.  For some reason, the candies are Mars bars and Milky Way rather than Hershey. agent_2:I'd think they'd have expensive candies from local shops. I wonder why the Senate used to have a rule that women were not allowed to wear pants until after 1993? agent_1:I suspect that women set the dress code in years past so they would look professional. Michael Jordan would not endorse a democrat because ""republicans buy shoes too"" agent_2:I heard that about Jordan but I really didn't understand what he meant. I also don't understand why Republicans started out with ideals more like Democrats today and then switched. "	agent_1:Jordan has his own line of shoes made by Nike.

Do you know why managers wear uniforms? agent_2:Yep, because they are technically able to play for their team if the need arises. I don't recall ever seeing one play though. agent_1:That's correct. I've never seen it happen either.  agent_2:I've heard that up from 1981 until 2005 a married couple actually scheduled all 2,430 major league games played each year. agent_1:Wow! That's some serious devotion to the game.  agent_2:Yeah it is. I find it fascinating that baseball is so popular in Japan. I remember watching games when I was stationed there and the crowds were amazing, even for small local games. agent_1:I had heard that it was so huge over there that they are surprised that it is our past time.  agent_2:Did you ever collect baseball cards? agent_1:I did not. How about you? agent_2:I collected them with my dad when I was a kid. I wish I could have found a collection like this one man did. He found three million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfather's attic. They had been hidden since the 1940s. agent_1:Wow! That's amazing.

One was Tommy Orange's debut novel. agent_2:I heard about that one, its the one with the little native american boy right? agent_1:Yes! It was quite an emotional read. It made me really think about how life is like for them. agent_2:Native Americans suffered for a lot of years, its a story that involves a lot of blood and tears and not an easy story to tell agent_1:Definitely!

It is interesting learning about the Republican party back in the 1800's! agent_1:The Republican party has deep roots, it has a long history, but it has changed. Now we are down to just two parties. It is not good. agent_2:Yeah I agree. Since 1853 there has been no president other than republican or democrats. agent_1:I think that the red/blue division has made politics unsatisfying for many voters.

12710	"agent_1:I am not a fan of Mitch McConnell.  The senate majority leader has gone somewhat nuts. agent_2:Good afternoon, I try to avoid the political shenanigans.  It's just one shyster trying to get something over on the other guy, all the time.   agent_1:Yes but even in 2016 the CIA was meeting with senior congressional leaders over the fact that Putin had authorized an operation to destabilize our election agent_2:That's Putin for you, he's going to do that, hard to believe it took the CIA needing to tell them he was doing it.  I'm sure all of our ""frenemies""  do the same thing and we do it to them, too. agent_1:Yes but it is scary that McConnell is denying the evidence and claiming that it is just a scheme by the CIA to discredit Trump.  He does not believe all of our national security agencies. agent_2:On a different and much happier note than all that crazy political mess, do you realize the consistent use of the red and blue colors for Republicans and Democrats only started in 2000?  That's probably about the time it started to get real ugly in politics. agent_1:Yes that is crazy but it has been ugly for a while - Harry Truman visited disneyland and refused to be photographed on the dumbo ride because it might associate him with republicans! agent_2:You know the voter turnout for a US presidential election hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years.  I'm going to be watching 2020, I think Trump can break that! agent_1:Certainly he has 60 percent of the country who think he is doing a horrible job so it might increase the turnout!  Too bad we can't have third parties - there has not been one elected since 1853 agent_2:Actually, I think there are that many that WANT to vote for him and are going to turn out to vote against whatever candidate the Dems throw up there.  That third party thing has never seemed to work out too well, a shame. agent_1:Well if he grew a beard it might help his chances - every president with a beard ever has been a republican agent_2:Well, that's a Southern/ Texas thing, a beard and that is the base for the Republicans, so that makes perfect sense to me. But, I usually look at the taller candidate, they seem to win 75% of the time, so maybe the Dems should be looking for them a giant? agent_1:That is a good point.  Beto O'Rourke is crazy tall - maybe he will win.   I think Nevada has the right plan - they have a none of these candidates option on their ballot agent_2:Or do what the officials in Ancient Athens did and appoint by lottery.  It you get picked, you get picked, do the job, and then move on and let the next one be picked to serve.  Probably more fair of a way than all the BIG money being pumped by both sides. agent_1:I agree.  Though I might go for term limits other a true lottery - I can think of a lot of my friends who I would not want making decisions in the government! agent_2:Oh, I got a few of them kind as well, friend.  I didn't realize that in the 2012 US elections international electoral observers were blocked from the polls in nine states.  I wonder if the CIA knew about that?  Maybe they were trying to pull something to affect our elections? agent_1:Yes there has been some craziness over the years.  I mean one year the ballot counting in Florida was stopped by the brother of the guy running for President - how would that have looked if it had happened in Africa or somewhere?  Fishy? agent_2:You know I'm from Florida and I love the Bush family.  They are good people and I remember them elections well, all we heard on mainstream media was this county here is majority Democrats, but how is it that 90% voted for the Republican candidate.  We're all registered Democrats, but vote Republican."	agent_1:Why register Democrat then?

The moon is not flat you know the tallest point is almost 2000 meters higher than Mt Everest. agent_1:Wow! I did not know that, very interesting.  I guess some people believed one of Mar's moons was artificial! agent_2:There is all kinds of funny ideas such as the moon landing being fake.

Did you know that the horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large single-toed animal of today?  agent_2:That makes it even more impressive that there are over 300 breeds of horses in the world today. agent_1:Yes, humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Some species were domesticated but then some are still living in the wild as feral horses. agent_2:I just heard that Icelandic horses have a fifth gear. Horses are simply fascinating. agent_1:Yes, I agree.

They have no rib cages so if they ever end up on land, they get crushed by the weight of their body. agent_1:Yes, sad indeed. Sharks even evolved earlier than dinosaurs and trees. agent_2:Have you ever seen the white shark cafe? It's where white sharks meet in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. agent_1:No, I've never seen it but I have heard about it.  Did you know that not just dolphins rescue sailors, but sharks too? agent_2:I did know that. Animals cease to amaze me. We have to protect them at all costs.	agent_1:I agree.

I would like to go to Mars someday agent_1:I would love to go to space! Yeah, and they say Kylie Jenner is self made. But I don't think that is true. Supposedly she is the youngest self made billionaire ever. agent_2:Yeah I do not know anything about her.  Did you know there was a dwarf planet between Mars and Jupiter?  I had never heard of it agent_1:Kylie Jenner is one of the Kardashians, I believe. I never knew about the dwarf planet between Mars and Jupiter!

7687	"agent_1:Do you truly believe aliens exist? agent_2:Yes I do.  I don't think we are all alone in this universe.  What do you think? agent_1:To be honest it has to be possible think about all the species of animals especially the ones we don't even know about in the ocean. Dolphins are already smarter then us so how could aliens not exist agent_2:I so believe we'll eventually find some.  But, I feel kind of like Stephen Hawking, it's dangerous to be communicating with them. agent_1:But what if people like stephan hawking understood things we dont' he is on another level of intelligence kind of like elon musk they are the human versions of aliens with their brains agent_2:I agree with you about that.  If we found some aliens, I'd say let's watch them for a good long time before any attempts at communication and they probably feel the same way about communicating with us. agent_1:Exactly if aliens wanted to harm us they could have easily already have done it, they don't want to interfere with us we shouldn't interfere with them agent_2:I agree, there's something to it, though when the UN has a contigency plan in place should aliens ever attempt to contact the Earth.  So, somebody knows something, they just can't alert the masses and create panic around the world. agent_1:So true and don't you find it wierd how drones were first military technology and then a couple of years later it becomes available to the public. Where did the military steal their ideas from drone technology from? agent_2:The same place they stole a whole bunch of their other ""ideas"".  It's just a matter of time, but hopefully Trump will have his Space force up and running by then. Lol agent_1:We're getting into alex jones and joe rogan territory here lol you should watch that on youtube so you can have a good laugh agent_2:I'll have to check it out, for sure.  On a side note, I hear that the Hudson Bay region of Canada has less gravity than the rest of Earth.

Earth has one natural satellite is Moon. The earth receives its light and heat from the sun. agent_2:Yeah and scientists say that earth will be virtually helium free by the end of the 21st century1 Crazy!	agent_1:The earth spins on its own axis it causes for the day and night changes.

I wish I could have watched the olympic events of literature back in the day! agent_2:That is right along with music and painting!! And it was until last centuries!! agent_1:That is so crazy! I didn't even know romantic kissing was a fairly recent development in literature! Where have I been! agent_2:Wow, And it was not mentioned frequently in greek literature agent_1:Those stories were still amazing though even without that haha. I wonder if they ever wrote about humans losing their body hair 240,000 years ago? agent_2:LOL who knows!! but I found crazy that there is  a contest to come up with the worst opening sentence of a novel agent_1:I'm sure there have been many dandies! I bet Winston Churchill wasn't in that since he won a nobel prize in literature. agent_2:Yes he did not earn a peace nobel prize! agent_1:You would have thought that is what it was for! I sometimes wonder what sound frequency causes fear in us? agent_2:Wow, I guess they use those frequencies in suspense and terror movies! but did you know we could re-grow a rib	agent_1:That is crazy that we can!

I didn't know Tom Hanks had a brother that does his voice on video games and merchandise... agent_1:Jimmy Hanks!  I think I have heard about that before, good call! agent_2:I guess ya gotta help out your bro.  Video games were once called ""cathode ray tube amusement devices"" by the military...

Can you play the piano? agent_2:I can play some, I have an electric piano that I keep plugged in in my room. agent_1:Thats really cool, I can play a bit, but spend more time with other instruments.  Did you know Freddie Mercury used the same piano for Bohemian Rhapsody that McCartney used for Hey Jude in the recording studio? agent_2:That's really cool. I wish the news would play piano instead of news these days like they did back in 1930. agent_1:I know. It would be far better than the slanted views they all put out today.  Id actually enjoy that. agent_2:Do you like Amazon? I have Amazon prime video and it with Netflix is all I really use for tv these days. agent_1:I love amazon!  Love how quickly they can get things out, even on sundays agent_2:Maybe I should get a job in one of the Amazon warehouses, sounds like a good idea to lose some extra weight since they walk 7 to 15 miles per day! agent_1:That might be a good gig for me too, trying to up my step game.   agent_2:I would love to visit the clock in the mountain that Jeff Bezos had built. agent_1:That would be cool.  It is going to run for 10,000 years so youve got time. agent_2:So how do you feel about snakes? I have a pet king snake myself, and I love them. agent_1:I dont think I could own one, but Im not scared or anything.

12356	agent_1:hi,  do you like animals?  did you know the loch ness monster is a protected species?  agent_2:I did not know that. That will come in handy once we find one. Also,Germany was the first country in the world to universally give animals legal rights that were constitutionally guaranteed. This was in 2002. agent_1:Sweet!  hmmm domesticated animals develop a white patch,  I wonder if that is only towards horses or all animals.  agent_2:Yeah, I wonder if that occurs naturally or because of how they are bred. agent_1:Maybe.  I know Orcas dorsal fin tends to flop over in captivity but it the wild the dorsal fin it straight up.  agent_2:Interesting. There are so many things to learn about animals, especially knowing that there are 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth. agent_1:i wonder how many zeroes are in a quintillion lol That is a lot of animals!  i love the discovery channel I watch a lot of animal shows.   Did you know theres a breed of horse that has a fifth speed?  I guess it is called a tolt.  agent_2:I heard a tolt is speedwalking for a horse. That's pretty funny! agent_1:That is cool,  horses got places to go!  speed walking is helpful.  agent_2:I can't imagine being allergic to horses. I would be devastated. Apparently Clint Eastwood developed an allergy to them although he has been on horseback in many of his movies. agent_1:Yeah I know right,  hes in so many western movies,  I guess he had to take daily claritin for his allergies!   agent_2:Haha. I am glad we get to use horses for leisure these days or for recording movies, haha. Historically they were used in warfare. agent_1:did you hear about the lipizzaner horses?  They are born a dark color and later turn white?  Thats amazing! agent_2:That's totally weird. I had not heard about that. Horses are great runners, but apparently we are the best distance runners. agent_1:Maybe because we train with the knowledge we have to run far.  Animals just run for fun or because they have to.  agent_2:Well, that makes sense. We also cannot synthesize vitamin c like plants or animals. agent_1:Damn defective gene.  Its ok,  forces us to get out in the sun!   agent_2:And drink lots of lemonade, yum. Haha. agent_1:Yes,  so refreshing!   agent_2:PETA feels strongly about animals and says their treatment is a social justice issue. We keep learning how intelligent and sensitive animals are and so it kind of is but sometimes they can go too far. agent_1:Yeah I feel very strongly about animals too. 	agent_2:It's good that PETA teaches people to be kind of animals.	agent_1 likes pets. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['pets', 'animals', 'hobby'].

Have you ever seen 3rd rock from the sun? agent_1:I have watched a few episodes but I didn't follow it closely? How about you? agent_2:I've seen a few. I heard it beat out Seinfeld, Friends, and even Frasier for the best comedy award in 1997. agent_1:That was a lot of great shows nominated at once. I watch a lot of Brooklyn Nine Nine now, I think that's one of the best shows on TV. agent_2:I've never seen it but I have seen the commercials and it looks funny.  You are right about all those great shows.  Sounds like there was a lot of good comedy back in 1997. agent_1:It's definitely not the same these days as it was back then. I think the rise of cable prices has hurt how many people are watching TV. agent_2:Speaking of cable tv. What do you think of comedy central? agent_1:I like Comedy Central, I haven't watched it as much lately because I have been watching Netflix and Amazon Prime more. agent_2:Comedy Central may be very particular on how they do comedy.  I've heard they've canceled over 100 shows since they started back in 1989. agent_1:That's a lot of shows to cancel. I know from watching Daniel Tosh's show he would reference a show they canceled quickly each week. agent_2:Really?  I guess they are selective then.  i've never watched the channel. Do they do different types of comedy or just one? agent_1:They have a lot of original programming so they broadcast a wide variety of comedy. They also air original stand up comedy specials as well. agent_2:So have you ever seen ken jeong perform? agent_1:I have not seen him perform his stand up yet. He just released a new special on Netflix. I have only seen him in movies and on TV. agent_2:Yeah, i haven't seen him either.  I heard he used to be a doctor of some kind. agent_1:Yes he was, it's a pretty interesting career transition from being a doctor to being an actor.	agent_2:Especially to a stand up comedian/actor.

I know that black swallower fish can eat prey twice its own length and ten times its weight. I am very impressed with that fact.  agent_1:That is pretty amazing!  I don't think I could eat that much,  but sometimes it feels like I do!  did you know there a breed of jelly fish and lobster that is immortal.  Of course its only immortal if no one kills it lol but it literally can live forever! agent_2:I actually have heard that before and wondered why we are not studying jellyfish more to find out how and why that is possible. Could we use that to our benefit in any way I wonder?  agent_1:I do not know,  I just seen it on Blue Planet on Netflix lol maybe their organs do not age after a certain poing lol  agent_2:Maybe. I would really like them to find out more about that. Did you know that a seahorse is the only fish with a neck? agent_1:Yeah that is interesting!  Some fish look like they have necks though lol so they have necks and can carry a baby good for them.  agent_2:Yes some do but only the seahorse truly does. Freshwater fish only ""drink"" water through their skin via osmosis, while saltwater fish also drink water through their mouths.

What baseball city you like? agent_2:I'm a Nationals fan. It seems like the Astros made a splashy move by not having to commit tens of millions of dollars in annual salary well into the next decade.  agent_1:I hear ya....do you think Gerrit Cole is worth all the effort to get him? agent_2:I'm not sure, probably not, but let's see. Did you know that the managers wear uniforms because they technically are allowed to play?  agent_1:I never new the managers could also play. Can't remember that happening in ages. I always sort of liked Justin Verlander when he was with the Tigers. The Indians always kicked his butt. agent_2:Yeah.

I wonder what separates the two from each other then, i have to imagine they look very similar agent_1:You would think but that's not what they pay me for, ha. Maybe we should move to new zealand they don't have snakes there. agent_2:i agree, snakes are so creepy, they are a very lucky country in my opinion agent_1:Mine too. Apparently fear of snakes is hard wired into our brains and monkeys. agent_2:maybe it is because of the way that they move or the noises that they make?

A while ago, ancient babylonians understood astronomy so well, they were able to track planets with mathematical precision!  agent_2:Its amazing that they were able to do that without the modern optics and computers we have today.  It seems the interest in astronomy is so great that even the Vatican has an observatory!  agent_1:I went to the Vatican a few years ago, and did not know that!  Wi-fi was actually a byproduct of research into improving astronomy imagery. agent_2:I doubt the younger generation would know how to live without WiFi.  They seem to live their life on the internet via social media.  Did you know that Finland has made access to the internet a human right? agent_1:I did not know it is a right in Finland! I agree with too much reliance now.  I don't know how many will need this, but there is 3g service and internet capabilities at the peak of mount everest.  So you can take the selfie up there before passing out.   agent_2:LOL.  What amazes me is how people assume they can do anything, even on their employer's internet!  Did you happen to hear about the criminal investigation that shut down the Sunspot Observatory in NM? agent_1:I remember when that was going on, didn't hear too much why initially.  I know there were theories of Aliens? agent_2:Well, it was not E.T downloading illegal materials; it was the janitor!  I am glad the facility director got the FBI involved. agent_1:Definitely glad the FBI got involved!  That janitor claimed someone been entering there to steal their internet service!  Lol I don't think E.T would stop there now! agent_2:Thankfully that is over and the observatory is back up and running.  And, I hope they have upgraded their internet security!  Do you think there is life out there that we do not yet know about? agent_1:I do think how vast the galaxies are, that there has to be life somewhere else!  In the X-Files aliens started to colonize Earth in 2012.  That hasn't happened yet! agent_2:I find it interesting that the U.N. already has a contingency plan in the event aliens do make contact.  People have been fantasizing about forever; an ancient Greek wrote about plant like aliens on the moon over 1800 years ago! agent_1:Wow that is a long time ago, and where humans were thinking about that!  Tom Cruise believes in aliens, he built an underground bunker to protect himself from E.T.	agent_2:Tom Cruise may be a popular actor but he also has very unique beliefs!  Perhaps aliens are already here spying on us!  Did you know that humans are a minority  on the internet, being outnumbered by bots? Perhaps some are there collect info for their home world?

Do you used facebook? agent_1:Yes, but I'm not addicted... It was a tough SC case.  I'm not sure I agree that schools should have to perform medical procedure.

428	agent_1:did you see that Kanye is having another kid? agent_2:I heard something but I'm not really following his offspring :) agent_1:I saw that they are using a surrogate and only paying 70k.  I'd want a whole lot more than that! agent_2:ok, yes that's what I read... and somebody needs to explain to me, how using a surrogate really works... agent_1:Simple explanation:  They take egg from mom, Sperm from dad - put it together and then into another person. agent_2:ok... why are they doing that ? Kardashian can't have babies ? agent_1:Not sure to be honest, I'd love to know too though. agent_2:I think it's just another thing to do to be on the cover of the magazine and have plenty of interviews...  this is a crazy world...  agent_1:I wouldn't doubt it.  Speaking of him, do you like rap music? (trying to cover the topics! haha) agent_2:lol ;) no, not really... I don't consider it to be music ;) agent_1:I mean - I think it is definitely music...but I agree not my type. agent_2:Doesn't music needs melody ? ;) agent_1:Lots of rap does have that! agent_2:a sample on keyboard doesn't count ;) agent_1:I'm thinking you haven't heard much more than whats on the radio then	agent_2:Maybe You're right, I don't want to argue ;) not my cup of tea though :) I'm more of a blues fan.

The Theory Of Everything,  very well done and explained a lot about his life.  agent_1:Interesting, I've seen that one too. Did you know a lot of his work is around blackholes?  agent_2:Yes.  Did you know that the deepest note in the universe is emitted by a black hole!  agent_1:It wouldn't surprise me. I think a lot of his work was around the Event Horizon's if I remember correctly. 	agent_2:If you fold a paper in half 103 times it would be as thick as the observable universe!	agent_1 likes astronomy. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['astronomy', 'movies', 'The Theory Of Everything'].

Did you know that managers are technically able to play for their teams? agent_2:I wonder why they wore those uniforms.  I wonder if one has actually ever played? agent_1:The only one I can think if is Pete Rose who regularly played as manager. Do you have a favorite team? agent_2:My favorite team is the Atlanta Braves, from the days of Chipper Jones.  What's your favorite team? agent_1:Mine is the Dodgers. I have to admire that team that Atlanta had, their pitching staff was something else. agent_2:I hear in Japan, baseball is so popular that some Japanese people are shocked to find out that its America's national pastime. agent_1:So I've heard. Do you think that Japan should ever be allowed to compete for the world championship? agent_2:Sure, why not?  They have some pretty good players, actually.  agent_1:They do. I have always been a little upset because the US always considers their sports teams as world champs but yet don't have to prove it.	agent_2:That's so true!

309	"agent_1:Hello, Did you know that there are over 1.5 million living animal species? agent_2:No, that was chock  full of interesting facts. Hiccups are residual from when we had gills and lungs? Interesting stuff. agent_1:Never heard that one before, lol! There is a fish called the black swallower that is capable of eating prey twice its length and 10 times its own weight. agent_2:I knew one of those in my fraternity in college I think. I was shocked to learn there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal. Only creature on earth that can claim that here on the planet. agent_1:Yeah we all know that guy! how about the loch ness monster being protected under the Scottish 1912 protection of animals act. Creatures of the great deep are extraordinary. ""The immortal Jelly fish.  agent_2:I already looked up that jellyfish on my phone. Fascinating, yes loch ness is protected and pets in Boulder, Colorado are not owned, but guarded. Interesting how different cultures handle that. agent_1:Tell me about it apparently there are more U.S. Tigers living as pets than there are living in the wild in Asia. agent_2:Yes, that is sad in some ways too. Happy we're keeping them alive, probably in zoo but going extinct in the wild is a sad statement on the planet today. agent_1:I agree. Germany became the first country to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed rights.   agent_2:While I'm a pet owner, that going a bit far. Do you give dogs and cats rights, how about those dairy cows or cattle to be eaten. Do they get lesser rights? agent_1:Very good point. My wife and I are watching Blue Planet. It's shocking some of the things that are down in the deep. they are still making discoveries every single day. Apparently the sea horse is the only fish with a neck.  agent_2:Yes, and really they say we know more about the face of the moon than the bottom of the ocean. Who knows what's down there we don't know?  Maybe the Loch Ness monster's cousin. agent_1:If you ever get a chance you should check this show, there's some amazing creatures down there. 84% of genes that are associated with diseases have counterparts in the Zebrafish.  agent_2:I read that and thought the same. I wonder how similar the Zebra Fish is to humans? Can we use that in medical research? agent_1:If we can i'm sure it will be preventative or medication. There's no money in cures. I didn't realize that we had already cloned a cat and named it Copy Cat, that's too funny. agent_2:Yes, the scientist in that experiment had a sense of humor. Related to domestication, I had no idea that domesticated animals develop a white patch on their foreheads. I wonder what causes that, it doesn't seem to have any evolutionary reason to me. agent_1:Sounds strange. I can't fathom why anyone would want a rat for a pet. I'm a little leery of guinea pigs and ferrets. anything with red eyes you can keep.   agent_2:Haha, yep. A snake doesn't seem very warm or comforting either. I don't understand why people enjoy having them as pets. And how do they find partners who accept it? agent_1:Other people who like that stuff i guess, haha. Apparently Theodore Roosevelt had 20 pets including a bear and Hyena. I wonder if he played with them much? "	agent_2:Well, President of the United States, I wonder if he had them in the White House?

7799	agent_1:hey what search engine do you use? Is it google? agent_2:Hello, how are you? Yes I use Google predominantly, unless I am looking for videos or music. What about you? agent_1:Well Actually I use Bing because they pay you for every search, but it's crazy that Google Maps can tell how congested traffic is by how fast android phones are movie agent_2:I know right. Or the fact that one of Google's search requires more power than it did to send Neil Armstrong and 11 other astronauts to the moon. agent_1:ya that is crazy! I do like that they're a green company and one time used goats to mow their lawn haha agent_2:Yes, goats are very effective.  Talking about google. Google uses andriod devices moments to calculate traffic  agent_1:ya they do, they also are a huge part of internet traffic, when they were down for about 5 mins they took out 40 percent of total web traffic1 agent_2:interesting..google tailors its maps around disputed borders based on where the browser is located  agent_1:haha that makes sense, do you use Spotify? I only use youtube myself agent_2:I use them all, Pandora, You Tube and Spotify. The all have there different  purposes. Spotify has so many songs that 20% of them have never been played. agent_1:ya that is crazy, that's about 4 million songs, I guess a musician woul dneed their song played 130,000 times in order to earn minimum wage  agent_2:Yes per day, that is crazy. A band earned $20,000 from spotify for a silent album. agent_1:haha that is genius, I guess the guy behind spotify is also the guy who created utorrent which is something I use agent_2:I use spotify when I just want something playing in the background or to listen to a whole CD. But when I want to watch the videos I switch to YouTube. Did you know YouTube is the second largest search engine. agent_1:I didn't but that makes sense, have you checkout out the police version of youtube, blutube? agent_2:I have heard of it but now seen it. I just can't believe the amount of content, in 2017 there were 400 hours of content uploaded every minute, so crazy. agent_1:that is crazy, also I remember when Gangnam Style came out and Youtube had to upgrade itself to handle the traffic agent_2:I remember that too.

I usually pay attention around the time of the playoffs. Then there's a lot of energy. agent_2:Yeah it gets burst of energy, and then a lot of really boring Parts LOL. I never knew that baseball managers could actually play for their team. That's why they wear uniforms, duh agent_1:Yeah, it's easier to just watch the highlight reel. The managers probably played way back in the day. Now? It would be sad. I'd want my money back. agent_2:Haha yep they would probably get injured really quickly LOL have you ever played kickball when you were a kid agent_1:I played kickball.

Isn't the Ganymede Jupiters own moon? agent_1:yea, it would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun, that is amazing agent_2:Very, Did you know our planet Earth has other names besides Gaia? agent_1:I didn't know there were any names besides Earth, lol. I guess maybe the blue planet, what other names do you know? agent_2:Tellus and Telluris!  very cool! This is also a planet that orbits four stars! agent_1:wow! I love learning! I think I saw once that astronomers found a planet many light years away that could sustain life agent_2:Yes, I heard that too! Exciting!!

I know that five planets are visual with the naked eye in the sky agent_2:Yes, Aren't they interesting! Do you have a favorite planet? I think mine would be Jupiter and Venus!! agent_1:Mine is mars, I hope we get a man on mars in my lifetime, do you think it will happen/ agent_2:Oh yes, Mars!! I love it too!! I hope so, There is a good chance we will.  agent_1:I bet, the more money we spend the better our chances.

Which is album is that concert for? agent_1:I'm not actually sure. I will have to look that up. But he played a lot of past songs too. agent_2:Oh! I think the album is actually called Man in the Woods. I don't think it was as good as his earlier stuff. I only really remember Say Something from this new album. agent_1:Yeah. Well I think it's safe to say he has come a long way since Mickey Mouse Club! agent_2:Have you seen any of the movies he's been in? agent_1:Yeah I saw the one about facebook which I thought was good. He is a good actor but I think he should stick to pop music. Ricky Gervais was a pop singer oddly enough. agent_2:I can't remember the name of the movie I saw him but Cameron Diaz and Jason Segal were in it too. It was pretty good. I can't imagine Ricky Gervais singing at all! He's hilarious though. agent_1:Oh yeah I remember that movie too. Like a rom-com. Yes he is. I want to look up his video lol. Wonder if he played the guitar? agent_2:Haha I don't think so. His voices doesn't sound like it would translate to a singing voice at all. Although doesn't his character in The Office sing? agent_1:Haha occasionally yes but not well. I just watched the movie about queen. The guitarist, Brian May, has a phd in astrophysics. agent_2:I haven't seen that movie, but that band was incredibly talented. I heard the actor who played Freddie Mercury in it didn't sing the songs himself. agent_1:No don't think he did. He won an oscar for it though. well deserved. Matthew Bellamy from the band muse holds the guiness world record for most guitars smashed on tour! agent_2:That's cool! Muse is pretty underrated band. Super Massive Blackhole was a great album. agent_1:Yeah I agree. Van Halen was also one of my favorites. He actually set the speakers on fire when he recorded beat it. agent_2:Do you like rock music better than pop music?	"agent_1:Yeah for sure.

I also didn't know that the Prime Minister selects and then can dismiss members of the cabinet. I always wondered what they did agent_1:It's a little strange, isn't it? But on a lighter note, a radio station prank called Queen Elizabeth II back in 95, pretending to be Jean Chretien who was the Prime Minister of Canada back then. Ha! agent_2:That is very strange. Do you know who Helena Bonham Carter is? She was in the Harry Potter movies, but anyway she is the great-granddaughter of a prime minister agent_1:Is that so? I wonder if she used her family to become an actress? Ha! Well in Japan, their Prime Minister sends their residents a silver cup when they turn 100 to celebrate it. Problem is, so many are turning 100 now, they're having to find ways to make cheaper cups. That's a good thing though!	agent_2:That is a good thing! What do you think about Wikileaks by the way?

Disney released the first trailer for next year for the Lion King remake. agent_2:That's correct. Disney is calling the new Lion King remake a live action film but it relies almost exclusively on CGI so a lot of people consider it annimation. agent_1:I do too. A related debate arose when Avatar was released, with the Visual Effects Society honoring James Cameron's 2009 epic for, among other trophies, animated character in a live-action feature motion picture agent_2:I agree that these kinds of films are skirting the line between traditional annimation and heavily CGI assisted live action films. With the improvements in the technology I'm not sure it makes sense anymore to feel the need to classify such films in the traditional modes.	agent_1:Yeah I feel the same way of course Jon Favreau, the director of the Lion King remake has naturally walked down this valley before, with his update of The Jungle Book. 	agent_2 likes movies. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movies', 'animation', 'no'].

I do like their shows though agent_1:Netflix tv shows are awesome. And Netflix founder was reed hastings and marc. agent_2:Yep he started it because he was mad about the late fee for his movie Apollo 13 haha that is actually really good movie have you ever seen it agent_1:I saw that movie. I think the movie was released in 1970. agent_2:I think it was actually in the nineties I think you're thinking of the wrong one haha. Apollo 13 head Tom Hanks in it. What do you think about Tom Cruise though agent_1:I love tom cruise and his movies. It was awesome. mission impossible movie was so great. agent_2:Yep I like Mission Impossible II. I also like The Color of Money in the movie Cocktail. Eyes Wide Shut was pretty weird though haha agent_1:tom cruise edge of tomorrow movie was awesome. edge of tomorrow directer has a great mind. agent_2:It's crazy that Tom Cruise spent two years learning Japanese and how to use a samurai sword to prepare for the movie The Last Samurai. Personally I didn't really like that movie what did you think agent_1:Tom cruise was great actor and hard worker. He spend a lot of to learn a japanese language. agent_2:Yeah for sure.

Tom Cruise is kind of a weird guy though. He spent $10 on a bunker to protect himself from outer space aliens agent_1:It's great but i don't know.	agent_2:Do you ever watch Game of Thrones?

No, I did not know that, that is very interesting.  agent_1:Also, Astronauts vote from space, so the rest of us have no excuse not to make it to an election.  agent_2:That is crazy, but understandable.  And you are right, gives us no excuse.  Did you know about Jordan's political dealings? agent_1:I don't. Tell me more. agent_2:He was asked why he would endorse a Democrat, and he said because republicans buy shoes too.  I thought it was funny.  agent_1:Haha, that is funny! Nevada is the only state to have a ""none of these candidates"" voting option for presidential elections. agent_2:Yeah I think the Nevada voting laws are quite odd.   agent_1:The voter turnout for us presidential elections hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years!

I hope they're not too expensive! agent_2:That's insane. I just learned they have Wizard of Oz inspired shoes that can guide you home when you click you heels agent_1:That's pretty cool! I like that Steve Smith leaves his cleats every game to make people aware of the homeless without shoes. agent_2:Yea, that is very thoughtful. Did you know in the 9th century Persian Cavalry soldiers wore high-heeled shoes> agent_1:I can't imagine soldiers in high heels! Another thing I can't imagine because it's portrayed differently is that pilgrims wore tons of colorful clothes and black only for special occasions? agent_2:I never knew that but there are still African tribes that wear old Victorian clothing so anythings possible agent_1:Me either.  Did you know Apple had a clothing line 1986? I thought they only did technology... agent_2:Well there are some odd clothing compaines, Miguel Cabarello makes bulletproof clothings	agent_1:I wonder if that is extra heavy?

2827	agent_1:Are you a fan of books?  I personally read a lot, mostly non-fiction though. agent_2:I don't really have time to read but when I do I like to read fiction. I find it funny that Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Greek mythology. agent_1:That is sort of odd.  There is even a wiki that ranks fictional characters by their powers, that would be an interesting read. agent_2:And in Greek literature there wasn't much kissing. Romantic kissing is actually a recent development. agent_1:That surprises me, I  guess I always associated it with all love stories.  Even Shakespeare. agent_2:Yeah I think there was a lot of romance just kissing wasn't part of it. agent_1:I see.  Winston Churchill won a Nobel Prize, for literature.  I always though it was for peace	agent_2:Interesting! Literature was an olympic event from 1912 to 1952.

I think because it just it's something that always makes me think of warm weather and summer time.  Did you know they call kickball soccer-baseball in Canada? agent_2:It is nice to sit outside and watch a baseball game in warm weather. I agree.  I didn't know they call kickball ""soccer-baseball"" in Canada.  That is funny."	agent_1:I wonder why they call it that.

I didnt realize that they dominated in the northern states either. agent_2:ya I didn't either, also didn't know that red and blue weren't associated with republicans and democrats until the year 200 agent_1:Same here!  I thought those had been around forever! agent_2:I know! It seems like forever since we had a president who wasn't a Democrat or Republican, since 1853 actuallY! agent_1:That is a long time.  Just goes to show you how long the two party system has really been in power. agent_2:yup I agree, we should change how elections are run, did you know that Back in athens a long time ago, they would just do a lottery to elect officials agent_1:I heard that was because they wanted to avoid oligarchy. agent_2:yup you're right, its sad though, the highest voter turnout we've ever had in the USA was 62.8% agent_1:Maybe if there were options like Nevada has people would vote! agent_2:yup but if they are choosing to vote ""none of these candidates"" then your vote is still meaningless haha so whats the point of showing up agent_1:Well, if there was something in place that would require a new ticket if that got so many votes that would be great. agent_2:ya thats a good diea, do you know why the taller candidate usually wins in US elections? That seems weird that they win 75% of the time agent_1:Yeah, maybe people associate height with power? agent_2:it must be something primal like that, did you know that there is an exclusive subway line that shuttles congresspeople to different government buildings? agent_1:I heard about those, and the Rep. vs. dems baseball game the congress plays.  That must be hilarious. agent_2:yes they've been playing those games since 1909, the republicans are up by 3 wins overall btw! agent_1:I wonder how many people actually play fantasy congress.

They're a big market team, so I expect them to get marquee players. agent_1:They have a good team, so there are two points of view, a well reseted team vs a team that comes into season with a lot of practice, which one do you prefer? agent_2:I would practice. I think skills get rusty. Baseball is a team sport, so they should work together. Other teams will have practiced. agent_1:I  think practice is better, a well rested team might begin with some troubles, games are neccesary to adapt. agent_2:Yes, I would want people to practice. They need to prepare for the season. Did you know that baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if the need arises? agent_1:Ive always wondered about that, do you know if it ever happened in a game? agent_2:I suppose back in the day one of the players was chosen to be manager. Handled both jobs. Now, not necessary. agent_1:I see well the game is really popular in Japan, seems like it has a lot of fans over there agent_2:The game is very popular. I think that the Japanese have made their own version of it. Uniquely Japanese. agent_1:They did? wow, they must really like it them did you watch the Wold Series last year? agent_2:I didn't get the chance to watch a lot of it. I know that the Dodgers lost again. agent_1:I didnt watch it either, its a game with a lot of tradition almost 120 years since the first World Series, so 120 champions agent_2:The Cubbies won back to back WS. Then after that? It's like a curse. What should they do? agent_1:They should get like an exorcism done by all religions lol, it does seem like a curse agent_2:The sports is popular here, but not around the world. The women's world cup had higher television ratings than the world series in the united states. agent_1:It did? guess not only the mens category is popular then, before 1969 the team with the best record would advanced to the WS that has changed now agent_2:I think the playoffs are fun, but probably a good way to get more money. The fans don't seem to mind. agent_1:So the Chicago Cubs and their curse, to think the Cubs and the Braves are the oldest teams in the league agent_2:The Braves have moved a lot, I think.

The New York Yankees have a lost player....never found! How odd. agent_1:That is odd... a man once found some 1900s baseball cards in his granfathers attic and they where worth 3 million bucks agent_2:Wow, lucky! Did you know kickball is considered a type of baseball in Canada? Interesting!  agent_1:That is interesting! Baseball is so popular in Japan that many fans are suprised to know it is considered Americas national pastime	agent_2:That's funny, it has always been America's favorite pastime!

Did you know Hillary Clinton was president of young republicans in college? agent_1:I'm not surprised. Did you know Arnold traveled 3 hours a day to Sacramento when he was the governor?  agent_2:Wow that's crazy. I can't imagine traveling that far for work.  agent_1:Me either.

But I never knew that Iceland actually has a specific horses with a fifth speed, other horses do not have this ability for some reason agent_1:I don't understand the speeds. Trot, gallop, ??? What else is there? agent_2:yes its something called Tolt, I don't know exactly how fast that is though lol	agent_1:I guess they have used horses there for many purposes.

Wow. agent_2:I knew it was perhaps the most sold and published book of all time agent_1:Yes. Prior to 1963 it was not uncommon for students in the US to be required to read from the bible as part of their elementary eduction! agent_2:Yes I lived in the Southern US for a while and they still use that at times agent_1:Nice.  Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the Bible.  He used a razor to cut out the supernatural parts, such as the miracles and the resurrection. agent_2:I was fascinated to hear about that.  That would mean he did not accept the divinity of Jesus Christ, but that He was only a human man. agent_1:Yes!  Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams are the only 2 US presidents that did not use a bible when they were sworn in. agent_2:Yes that would indicate to me that they were agnostics or aherents to another form of religion agent_1:Yes.  The biblical tower of Babel was likely based on a real building, the Etemenanki in modern day Iraq. agent_2:I did not now that, but it is certainly possible.  William Shakespeare wrote an incredible amount of material even though he died at 49 years old. agent_1:Yes he did!  he is regarded ad the greatest writer in the English language! agent_2:I think I read the cliff notes to one of his plays, but I could never stay interested in his works! agent_1:I read the cliff notes of some of his things in college.  He coined a lot of popular phrases that we still use today like ""good riddance"" and ""wild goose chase"". agent_2:Yes those sayings certainly seemed to have stuck into modern language agent_1:Pocahontas and Shakespeare were alive at the same time and died only a year apart.

For me personally it can't get here soon enough. But whatever happens we will get by! I was reading about the talks about how George Hathaway, has a book about the Alt-Right, pretty interesting.  agent_1:Yeah. I am fearful of those groups normalizing hate speech, sorry if you're alt-right... agent_2:I am definitely not Alt-Right, these groups are scary to me. All the extremist groups are very scary. A man named Tenold wrote personal accounts on a personal level with these groups. Very interesting. agent_1:If I am alt-right, I do not want my name included with the KKK. However, I am not alt-roght and think they should be lumped in with them. agent_2:Everyone thinks modern day KKK is not a threat even by the Alt Right but I have to say they are in my opinion. They have committed hate crimes just as much as the other groups.  agent_1:I agree. I think their speech is just as dangerous. It tells others that hate speech is allowable and endorsed by people like the president.  agent_2:Exactly, couldn't agree more. Our country is so crazy and the books these men are writing prove to be a bit scary on much hate they have seen and heard. But we hope the upcoming election might change things. agent_1:I agree. It wouldn't surprise me to see someone so frustrated they run. I am thinking Michelle Obama... agent_2:Yes! That is really my thought too. We need a president who has a very good head on their shoulders. How awesome would that be! agent_1:I think she would be elected without having to outline policy, she is that popular. I think her book primed her run. It was conveniently released around exploratory committee time... agent_2:Exactly, I think she would have a great chance to be elected. She seems to be what we need right now! agent_1:I think we just need someone who doesn't marginalize a lot of the country. That's not a high bar to get over. Our current nation is that low right now... Jefferson would be rolling over in his grave. agent_2:I agree! We just need to hope we get good people running and hopefully more than the average 62% voter rate will climb. We really need this. Has Michelle Obama talked about running? agent_1:I was just talking about this the other day with a friend. In a country with like 350M people, Hilary and Trump were the two best people we could come up with? No she has not talked about it but I could see it. agent_2:I agree, that's why I hope we can get someone who could really get this country up and running and uniting. I really think whoever ends up in the White House next is either going to completely break us or start getting us above water, so to speak. agent_1:I agree. I am fearful that the Democrats will cannibalize the party and it will be tough to make whole going up against the Republican party. Nice I didn't say trump because I am skeptical he will run again. He hates bring president. agent_2:Exactly. I didn't know Trump didn't like being president. I wish we were not so divided into political groups, so muxh going on.

There is a breed that is immortal! agent_1:I have never seen a jellyfish in person. I love animals though. agent_2:I have almost stepped on a few when they wash up on the beach.  Scary stuff.  Fish in general can be scary like the black swallower than can eat prey ten times its weight. agent_1:Yeah and twice its own length. Wonder where it puts it all. agent_2:No kidding!  Only one fish has a neck, the seahorse.  That seems crazy to me! agent_1:Did you know freshwater fish only drink water through their skin via osmosis. agent_2:I did not know that!  I think as animal lovers we would be happy in Germany.  In 2002, they universally gave animals constitutional rights. agent_1:I dont know about taking it that far. Seems like they ma be trying to make up for something over there in germany. agent_2:Haha, very true.  That is a lot of animals to give right to!  I do now know how many are in Germany, but there are 20 quintillion individual animals on the planet! agent_1:That is a boat load of animals huh.	agent_2:I can't even comprehend that number!

It'll be funded by a reality show based off the project. I would love to see something like that! agent_2:It would be nice to see indeed, although Im not sure if they are going to make, its going to be interesting since episode 1 agent_1:Agreed. That is a pretty major undertaking, I would be surprised if it worked out. Do you know any cool facts about Mars or Earth? I know a little bit. It's terrible, over 80% of the natural forests on Earth have been destroyed, I think mostly by humans.	agent_2:That is a lot of trees!! we are seriously abusing the planet, it's curious how a day lasted 5.5 hours at the begining of earths creation	agent_1 dislikes day. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['day', 'TV show', 'episode'].
13422	agent_1:Hi, do you want to chat about Mars? Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman God of War and is often referred to as the Red Planet. agent_2:I would say that Mars is a fierce looking neighbor, but probably the friendliest planet at least for humans. Second to earth, that is. agent_1:Yes, I agree, it's reddish iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. agent_2:I think the red is clear from a distance, but up close, it's not quite so red. Plus I bet the atmosphere changes the appearance of a lot of things. And sound, too. agent_1:Well, Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere having surfaces like the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. agent_2:Mars has an atmosphere, but it makes the sunsets blue, I believe. Not really breathable.  agent_1:Yes, due to the differences in atmosphere, sounds on Mars have a higher pitch than they do on Earth. agent_2:That would make us sound funny! Like helium balloons do. Still, I would rather live my life on Earth. I know that with fast travel, we could get to Mars fast. But what would you do there? agent_1:If you change your mind, a Mars colonization project is planned for 2023 and will be funded by creating a reality TV show. agent_2:I would not want to be the first there. Couldn't pay me enough. agent_1:If you would fly to Mars under constant 1g acceleration, it will only take 2 or 3 days to get there. agent_2:That is still quite a while for regular business trips. And in economy class? Forget about it. agent_1:I agree. Only the lichens and cyanobateria would be able to thrive on Mars anyway. agent_2:I guess we could put atmosphere converters there and give it a few decades to shift to oxygen. Maybe it would be habitable.	agent_1:Depends on a lot of factors.

From what I read, in the interim has broken into acting, gotten married and became a father.  Do people think his songs are ""empty"" because he has changed his style or do they think he has lost his musical bearing?

It was kind of his fault. agent_2:And I guess the species is endangered, which is part of why it's a big deal agent_1:Yes.  40 cops tried to stop the crowd, but it turned into a mob of 600 villagers. agent_2:Most of the time they try to remove the animals humanely, but those cases are also in the United States. Those villagers likely acted out of fear agent_1:Yes, in some instances animals that attack are required to be put down and tested for disease like rabies agent_2:On the other end of the spectrum, animals have guaranteed legal rights in Germany agent_1:That is good.  There is a line between public safety and animal cruelty agent_2:As long as the public is safe. In Scotland, the Loch Ness monster is a protected species agent_1:That is funny.  Next it will be bigfoot agent_2:If Bigfoot is in the US, that one may not happen. Although if he has a white patch on his forehead, it's a sign that he's domesticated agent_1:Apparently humans looked like bigfoot many years ago.  Then about 240 thousand years ago we lost body hair	agent_2:One thing we didn't lose are hiccups. It's a leftover result of when land animals had both lungs and gills	agent_1 likes fun. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['fun', 'sports', 'no'].
2157	agent_1:Hi, Do you like to cook? agent_2:I love to cook. just not in july when it is so hot. agent_1:Right, it's no fun when it is hot and you're trying to cook. We like to grill a lot outside, which helps not make our home more hot. agent_2:Grilling out is the best to help with the heat inside the house. If I have to cook in the house i do it early in the morning before it gets too hot. agent_1:Yes that's another great idea. We also sometimes eat out if it is way too hot, or eating something like salads or cereal. Where we aren't using heat at all. agent_2:That is a great idea. We tend to eat leftovers too and just use the micorwave. agent_1:The microwave is great and fast, I agree. Making Icecream is a great way to cool down when it gets too hot. We also tend to use box fans. agent_2:We use a fan for sure. Also started using like a slow cooker or toaster oven not as hot and now can fit up to a whole chicken. agent_1:Great appliances help to cook! We love our air-fryer. Though it tends to eat up the area some, so we open the doors and dim the lights to help with the heat. agent_2:I heard some people turn their wrist upside down  to get their blood flowing to stay cool. agent_1:Wow great information, I will have to try that sometime. Do you like to eat fish or even go fishing? agent_2:I love to fish. the oldest goldfish lived to be 43 years old agent_1:Wow that is a long life for a goldfish! I like to go crabbing too. I heard the seahorse is the only fish with a neck, I agent_2:THere was a koi fish that lived 226 years agent_1:Whoa! That is crazy to know and interesting. I know there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal. agent_2:Cool the barreleye fish has a transparent head. agent_1:Awesome. I heard that saltwater fish dink water through their mouths and through their skin, while a freshwater fish only drinks through their skin. Fish are fascinating. agent_2:That is pretty cool. Do you like to bird watch? agent_1:There are times when i Do like to look at the birds, how about you? Did you know that birds bones are really hollow. So hollow in fact that their skeleton weighs less than their feathers. agent_2:thats neat. They have then thousand living species. agent_1:That's cool. Some birds are known to fly from Alaska to mexico without sleeping, that is tiring to think about. agent_2:o wow. I wonder how many days that takes. Scientist say birds have regional accents. agent_1:That is cool how they even have accents like humans. My favorite is the hummingbird, they are tiny sometimes about 2 inches long. agent_2:They are the smallest birds and the ostrich is the biggest. Some birds don't fly.	agent_1:This reminds me of the extinct dodo bird.

I guess for the song Smooth Criminal. agent_1:perhaps. what article you thought was the most interesting? agent_2:Tupac danced ballet in high school and ended up portraying the mouse king in a production of the nutcracker. agent_1:I found interesting the concept with rotten tomatoes. Poor people agent_2:Babies spontaneously dance when they hear music, and smile more when they hit the beat.  Dance is so interesting.  agent_1:Dance truly is interesting. As for the babies dancing spontaneously when they hear music, I totally agree. My child does the same agent_2:Mine do as well.  Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week. agent_1:That I certainly didn't know. She is still too little for ballet lol agent_2:Michael bay's average rotten tomatoes film rating is 38% agent_1:Quite surprising. Also Netflix has almost 150 movies with 100% rating on rotten tomatoes agent_2:I was just reading that.  How cool is that? I like to watch some of the stuff on Netflix. agent_1:I also like to watch movies on Netflix. Its convenient and the premium is not too high agent_2:Exactly, Spykids received a 93% fresh rating on rotten tomatoes, better than, say, lincoln or the dark knight rises. agent_1:true that.

Do you know why managers wear uniforms? agent_2:Yep, because they are technically able to play for their team if the need arises. I don't recall ever seeing one play though. agent_1:That's correct. I've never seen it happen either.  agent_2:I've heard that up from 1981 until 2005 a married couple actually scheduled all 2,430 major league games played each year. agent_1:Wow!

Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer as well as kung fu star and won the Hong Kong Cha-Cha championship in 1958. agent_1:That's cool,never would have pictured him doing the Cha Cha but it takes the same skills probably to perform Kung Fu. agent_2:Other stars you would not expect, Tupac danced ballet and was the Mouse King in his high school production of the Nutcracker. agent_1:Wow, Tupac?  You must be pulling my leg!  Never could he be a ballet dancer.  Wow!	agent_2:I know but creative people are drawn to the arts. Just like how babies are drawn to music.

That's awful to hear! agent_2:Of Roosevelt's 20 pets two were a bear and hyena! agent_1:Whoa, cool! I know he seemed to be quite the animal lover. agent_2:And there are more pets in Japan than there are children under 15. You can't be a pets ""OWNER"" in Boulder but you can be their guardian.   agent_1:I have a pet. I am an ailurophile meaning I love cats. agent_2:Cool word! Did you know there are 20 quintillion animal varieties on Earth? agent_1:That is a lot! And in 2002 Germany gave them legal rights. agent_2:Yeah, and the Loch Ness monster is protected under the 1912 Scottish Animal Protection Act. agent_1:I wonder if the immortal jellyfish needs protecting... being immortal and all. agent_2:Lol...speaking of water animals, did you know that hiccoughs are a left over from evolution when we had gills? agent_1:Maybe that connection is part of why 84% of human disease genes have counterparts in zebrafish, too... hmm. agent_2:Hmm? Good theory.

Her name came from the predictive text glitch that changed radio to lady! Interesting!  agent_2:Very interesting. A star is born is good you should watch it. It was Bradley Cooper's directorial debut. agent_1:I will definitely check that out! Her favorite band is Iron maiden, I wouldn't have guessed that! agent_2:I wouldn't have guess that either. She apparently has a 11.4 million followers on Twitter. agent_1:That seems more assumable! She was also asked by the lapd to tweet them about some roadwork once! agent_2:Oh wow I have never heard of followers being used like that. Elton John chose Lady Gaga as his son's godmother. I didn't know they were close. agent_1:I didn't either! Do you remember the show boiling points on MTV? Lady gaga was on it before she was famous.  agent_2:Yes I vaguely remember that show. I will have to look it up. She's one of the best selling music artists in history now. I bet she reminisces on those boiling point days. agent_1:Absolutely! Speaking of famous artists, Queens guitarist has a phd in astrophysics!  agent_2:Yeah I remember that from the movie Bohemian Rhapsody, did you see it? He also uses coins as guitar picks. agent_1:I didn't see that one either, i'm really behind on movies it seems!

Stephen king considers Bambi one haha. agent_2:King was just a kid, to be fair. That movie could be scary to a tiny child. He then turned his fright into a profession. agent_1:You're right on that one. Did you know you can burn 180 calories watching one? agent_2:I suppose that I could try to lose weight that way. It might be easier to exercise. I like a couple of films, but after the first viewing, they are not as scary.	agent_1:Just do a marathon one day of watching them and you'll be set.

Especially after a 108 year drought! agent_1:Totally! They were the first team to ever win back-to-back World Series, then nothing. agent_2:Yes I do love Wrigley field where they play - its within the city agent_1:Did you know they evidently didn't win for so long because they were ""cursed"" by a man named Billy because Wrigley Field security would let him stay there with his pet goat?"	agent_2:Yes - who takes a goat to a baseball game?

It looks like Stephen Strasburg is doing well since healing from his injury. agent_2:you know that ended in a 5-1 win for Strasburg and the Washington Nationals at Citizens Bank Park and gave the team its first five-game winning streak since the end of May. I was so surprised, can you imagine 5:1... agent_1:That's amazing. I can't believe the Nationals have a 19 year old rookie player who is doing so well. agent_2:yes that is amazing. He fell behind a couple times and got right back to throwing strikes. He did really, really well. Do you know Aaron Nola? agent_1:I have never heard of him. Is he a good player too? agent_2:Yes hi is. he Phillies' Aaron Nola has been one of the National League's best and is right behind Max Scherzer and the New York Mets' Jacob deGrom in the Cy Young conversation, that's the information I have learned	agent_1:That's something.

Astronauts are so cool, they vote from space agent_1:Every vote counts lol  agent_2:It sure does. In the UK not all men were able to vote until 1918 agent_1:Thats weird.  I wonder why that was.  Did you know the us sante used the same gavel for 165 years! agent_2:Yeah until Nixon broke it. I wonder if they were mad at him for that agent_1:haha,  maybe he just had to pay for a new gavel.  agent_2:Maybe. In Alabama sadly a large portion of the male balck population cannot vote agent_1:Wow,  permanently too.  I wonder if thats due to people in jail?  Maybe? agent_2:I think that is what it is. On the other hand in Texas seems people are more interested in voting to change the name of the garbage dump agent_1:That seems so dumb to me,  are there not more important things to vote on?  Also,  that is so negative towards that person,  arent we voting to make things better,  for positve outcomes.   agent_2:Yeah go figure.

I was not aware it had been so long. It makes me wonder how long I was on MySpace before that.   agent_2:I agree, I wonder why burger king wanted people to unfriend others  agent_1:I was not aware that they did. That's very strange. You'd think they'd rather advertise on the site since so many people are on there. Facebook makes most of it's revenue from advertisements.  agent_2:I understand that to be true also. I cant believe Iceland is using Facebook to rewrite their Constitution agent_1:That seems like a bad idea. People don't think before they type on Facebook and they're willing to be more ridiculous because they are behind a keyboard.  agent_2:Agreed. I have alsways really liked Micheal Jackson, and I knew he did work on the Simpsons agent_1:I have mixed feelings about him. As a pop star he was amazing, his personal life not so much. My understanding is that Freddie Mercury cancelled a duet with him because he insisted on bringing his llama to the studio. agent_2:Yes I understand the feelings, would have loved to see the 50 foot robot though agent_1:He had some very out there ideas. I did know that Eddie Van Halen Played the guitar solo in Beat It free of charge. agent_2:I did not know that either. and that Micheal helped write the soundtrack to sonic 3 agent_1:That seems very odd to me. Thinking back to the Sonic games they do not have music that I would have thought a high profile musician made.  agent_2:I would agree with that, but still good music. I knoew taylor swift removed her music from spotify but not pandora  agent_1:I wonder why? I use Pandora a lot. I often have it on when I exercise. They have a net income of $-16 million despite having $274 million in revenue. I really think they need to look into their overhead cost.   agent_2:I would agree. I know she didnt like how they pay artist. I did not know they were streaming comedy also agent_1:I didn't either. I have never tried to use it for that. I use Podcast apps for that purpose. I'll have to look into that.  agent_2:They have plenty of streams at 168 million steams for Aloe Blacc agent_1:That's a huge amount of streams.

I am not the biggest baseball fan although I do go to a few games each year agent_2:Yes baseball is so popular in Japan many people are surprised to find that it is our national game agent_1:I would be surprised too. Kickball is known as soccer-baseball in Canada. That is odd. agent_2:Yes.  I have had a few baseball cards in my day, but one lucky man found his grandfather had saved 3 million dollars worth of cards! agent_1:3 million is probably more money that I will ever have. The only things that my grandparents collect are rocks from their childhood. I do no think that those rocks will ever be worth 3 million! agent_2:laugh for sure!  Maybe you should try to be a team manager - they wear uniforms because theoretically they could put themselves in the game and play! agent_1:Really ? Although I do not think any of them have ever stepped in. I think that the actual players are much better than the coaches.  agent_2:No doubt but it would be fun to see one to step in for an inning - perhaps in the world series championship game	agent_1:Speaking of the world series, the Ottoman Empire still existed since the last time that the Chicago cubs won the world series!	agent_2 likes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'hobby', 'collecting'].

I remember seeing the trailer where Pooh goes, ""They say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing every day!"" I thought that line was funny. agent_1:I thought it was a clever adaptation of a classic that help the now older audience reconnect and relate in order to reconnect to their youth, perhaps having imaginary pals of their own agent_2:Hmm.. sometimes I think all my pals are imaginary.  Sadly, I'm told the REAL Christopher Robin (who the books were based on) hated them and never took any money from them.  I find that sad, since his father wrote the books for him.. agent_1:That is a shame. I wonder why the real chris hated them. Perhaps he wanted a father to be there for him rather than children books agent_2:I think maybe he felt embarrassed because the books were based so heavily on his life.  Did you know he died on Easter in 1996?  That was one year after I graduated from high school.  Man, I feel old!  LOL agent_1:Well I hope he at least found some solace in that it inspired and that it is a indispensable part of many children worldwide agent_2:Yeah, hopefully.  Anyway, like I said, I haven't seen it, I think I'll check and see if my library has it though.  I would get it from Netflix, but I don't have a subscription at the moment.  Are you on Netflix?  It's pretty awesome! They've got like 137 million subscribers worldwide. agent_1:While I understand their business model and why people use it, I never got it. It is impressive nonetheless that they account for 33% of all bandwith in north america during peak hours agent_2:Yeah, I've heard they're especially busy in the late hours.  Get this, they have an hour long movie that's nothing but a roaring fireplace!  I think people play it a lot during the holidays or winter months to give their living rooms (or whatever) a decorative look. agent_1:I think that that is surprisingly practical for the ambiance.

They regret that decision for sure!   agent_1:I mean if I could pay 50million today for 2 billion in a few years wow what an investment"	agent_2:Get this, Netflix has people on it's staff who's job is to watch the shows and tag the content (guessing with genre tags and stuff.)

Water is a very important resource that helps give life on earth. agent_1:Yes it does and the earth's surface is covered by about 71% of water.  The polar regions are covered in ice but that is just frozen water so-more water on the earth's surface. agent_2:That is true although I am not much into the science of earth. However I do appreciate the facts about the environment.  agent_1:Do you like planets in general?  Have you seen or noticed the five planets in the sky at night that can be seen by looking at them? agent_2:I like planets. And yes I have been able to see them when they are noticeable. I love It when I can see the stars so bright and clear. It's a shame that there aren't so many areas where you can see them due to Earth's atmosphere being affected.  agent_1:I agree with you on that.  It's extremely unfortunate that more than 80% of our planet's forests have been destroyed. agent_2:It is very devastating. Hard to believe that so many years ago there was so many trees and other living creatures we can't even see alive today anymore. agent_1:I know.  It makes me wonder what the planet was really like originally.  I know scientists say that in the beginning a day was on just over 5 hours long but I'm not sure they can actually know that.  So, I still wonder what all happened here long ago and what life was like. agent_2:Yeah I know what you mean. It doesn't seem logical that it was only 5 hour days. Although if they believe that then their time table of billions of years is very flawed. 	agent_1:Good point!

It rose to fame tso quickly agent_2:I haven't seen it yet either.  I heard it's good and that Bradley Cooper directed it as well as stars in it. agent_1:Yeah there is a lot of buzz. And then you have Lady Gaga on the other hand, they seem to make a great duo. agent_2:That's what I've heard.  They say she is not as good an actress as she is a singer but due to editing the movie makes the most of her singing. agent_1:Yeah, I guess. Apparently she got her name Lady because of a text glitch, from radio. agent_2:I didn't know that. I always wondered where it came from.  I like that she takes care of her fans.  I heard she bought a thousand dollars worth of pizza for fans waiting in line to see her. agent_1:Nice. Even LAPD work with her asking her to tweet that there is road work upcoming because she has so many followers. agent_2:That's pretty cool.  Speaking of cool, did you know that the Foo Fighters played a concert once that was so loud it showed up on new zealands seismic monitors? agent_1:Wow that is amazing. There is an ancient roman amphitheatre in crotia that can still be used for concerts. I wonder if theyhave played there. agent_2:I don't know but it would be great if they did.  That story about lady gaga buying pizza had me thinking about relations with fans.  I heard that a lady on her way to a dave mathews concert stopped to help a cyclist who turned out to be dave mathews!  I bet she got back stage tickets! agent_1:Wow you never know really.

Do you know when he graduated high school? agent_2:Hmm I am not sure actually, was it recent? agent_1:Yes pretty recent, it was in 2012 when he was 25 agent_2:Yeah better late than never I guess for him, he was busy otherwise agent_1:True .

Did you know the beat for Hotline Bling is sampled? agent_2:Did not know that, from which song? agent_1:It is the song WHy can;t we live together? agent_2:Nice.

427	agent_1:did you see that Kanye is having another kid? agent_2:I heard something but I'm not really following his offspring :) agent_1:I saw that they are using a surrogate and only paying 70k.  I'd want a whole lot more than that! agent_2:ok, yes that's what I read... and somebody needs to explain to me, how using a surrogate really works... agent_1:Simple explanation:  They take egg from mom, Sperm from dad - put it together and then into another person. agent_2:ok... why are they doing that ? Kardashian can't have babies ? agent_1:Not sure to be honest, I'd love to know too though. agent_2:I think it's just another thing to do to be on the cover of the magazine and have plenty of interviews...  this is a crazy world...  agent_1:I wouldn't doubt it.  Speaking of him, do you like rap music? (trying to cover the topics! haha) agent_2:lol ;) no, not really... I don't consider it to be music ;) agent_1:I mean - I think it is definitely music...but I agree not my type. agent_2:Doesn't music needs melody ? ;) agent_1:Lots of rap does have that! agent_2:a sample on keyboard doesn't count ;)	agent_1:I'm thinking you haven't heard much more than whats on the radio then	agent_2 dislikes music. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'music genre', 'technology'].
13089	agent_1:Hello! Are you a bird watcher? agent_2:Good Afternoon.  I actually am.  I don't get most of the 10,000 living species of them in my yard, but do enjoy watching the ones that I do have. agent_1:Ah, yes, nothing like a feathered, toothless endothermic vertebrate to warm the cockles of ones heart... and occasionally adorn the dinner plate!  agent_2:Ha, for sure!  I actually have a bird feeder and pond in my back yard that attracts them quite often.  Even get some hummingbirds during warmer weather.  It's kinda neat that they steal spiderwebs to repair their nests. agent_1:Ingenious little tweeters!  Except perhaps for the Dodo bird, a less-than-successful member of the pigeon family. agent_2:I didn't know they were from the pigeon family.  i wonder if they were trying to fly without sleeping like some birds do.when migrating and couldn't figure it out.  Sounds difficult to me. agent_1:Yeah, but birds can do a number of curiously difficult tasks, such as mimicking the sounds of cameras, car alarms, and even chainsaws! Now that is difficult! agent_2:I actually heard that.  I think some birds in Australia can pull that off.  Quite skillful if you ask me. agent_1:I'll say!  Try flying sometime!  You know, in most birds, their bones are soo lightweight, they weigh less than the feathers, which is one of the reasons they do not plumment to the ground while in flight... agent_2:Right, they are lightweight because their bones are hollow.  I wonder if that makes them more prone to breaking?	agent_1:I would think so. Except perhaps the extinct elephant birds. Their name, and the fact that they were featherless, suggest that they were not petite little hummingbirds. 	agent_2 likes animals. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['animals', 'feathered dinosaurs', 'entertainment'].
13506	"agent_1:Hi! Do you play video games? Did you know that it's illegal in South Korea for kids under 16 to play video games? I wonder how kids in America would take that, if that became a law here, haha.  agent_2:oh wow, that is weird I don't like that, I played lots of games as a kid what about you? agent_1:I know, I agree with you! yes, i till play from time to time I enjoy a good solo game of zombies, it gets my heart racing. Video games were initially called cathode ray tube amusement devices which were used by the military, another fun fact for ya.  agent_2:that is fun! kind of sad that humans as a whole play games for 3 billion hours a week agent_1:This is true! and I'm sure as video games progress and evolve we will lose touch of reality, what is reality anyway? Another cool game out there ""Little Big Planet"" was narrated by Stephen Fry. He also narrated hitchhiker guide to the galaxy and harry potter video games. Little Big Planet though is a fun Family game. agent_2:ah thats cool, I do like that game, did you ever play a toy story game? Tom Hanks brother does all the voices actually agent_1:No I have not, some theorists categorize video games as a form of art, but this designation is controversial. I was a hardcore Nintendo Super Mario girl. I still Love that game. agent_2:haha that game is amazing and I agree they are an art form! do you watch any judge judy btw agent_1:agreed, and Yes I have, I hear she makes about 123,000 an episode! yes, please! She makes almost as much as Lebron. agent_2:thats nuts! yup the second highest paid celebrity, I wonder how much Robin Williams made for doing the genie in aladdin agent_1:Im not sure, but surely a heck of a lot, he was a famous celebrity by then.

12015	agent_1:Hi, do you like tennis? agent_2:Not that much. If they still used a Helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts like they did in the 1969 open I would watch. agent_1:What if they did that while they played? It would increase the degree of difficulty.. would you watch? agent_2:Haha that would be funny and kind of scary! The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days. That would bore me for sure. agent_1:I remember that. It was a Jon Isner match in like wimbeldon. They had to stop due to the darkness and exhaustion. agent_2:The Roger Federer of paddle tennis wasn't that great apparently because US Open quarterfinalist Gael Monfils beat him within days of learning how to play. agent_1:Huh... No black man has won the us open since 1968 when arthur ashe won.	agent_2:Wow, wonder why.

It originated during the mid-1950s agent_2:yes very much so. agent_1:Until the 1960s rock and pop were considered the same agent_2:right ! and do you know that korea has its own k-pop band which is the most popular musical group in the country agent_1:Yea, Moranbong band I believe  agent_2:yes thats right. and another cool fact is that the president of indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office ? agent_1:Lol that's nuts. I didn't know Ricky Gervais was a pop singer in the 80s, it's hard to imagine agent_2:i know ! i never would have thought that either! agent_1:Apparently scientist voted ""We are the Champions"" as the catchiest pop song, I wonder how they came up with that agent_2:im not sure , but they are probably right. agent_1:I guess they concluded that pop has grown louder and increasingly musically homogeneous since the mid-1960s agent_2:yes and in  2002 CREED ocncert was so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band! wow ! agent_1:I don't blame them, I don't much like Creed myself. agent_2:yes they are !, it was great talking to you about music, i loved it , thank you  agent_1:No problem. Did you know the Ramones played 2,263 concerts? That's wild agent_2:yes thats pretty wild! agent_1:Apparently they toured non-stop for 20 years agent_2:cool! and did you know that when eddie van halen recorded the guitar solo for Beat it  that he literally set the speakers on fire agent_1:Lol, no but that's awesome.

What about you? agent_2:no not really. my kids do though. did you know the creator of atrari made chuckie chese to get kids to play games? agent_1:Really!??? That's so interesting! What a crazy idea to get people to play video games? agent_2:Video gaming wasn't as big then! I remeber my kids playing mortal kombat. Do you know that why they started rating video games? agent_1:Mortal combat is why they started rating video games? That seems like a benign game though. agent_2:It does now, but when it first came out? It seemed really violent. Australia probably banned it! agent_1:South Koreans 16 & under cannot play video games past midnight. Seems agist! agent_2:I think they want them to concentrate on getting some sleep! Video games make more money then films do! agent_1:That seems odd but I guess if you add in things like facebook games, that makes sense. agent_2:and the price doesn't seem to go down for video games like it does for movies. Is there any soundtrack from a video game you like? agent_1:Not really. I cant even think of a soundtrack for a video game. Is that a thing?	agent_2:It is! My guys like Mach the knife from some game.

Also all the old album rock of the Progressive Rock era, when people really started listening to music as albums instead of singles.

I was reading about the talks about how George Hathaway, has a book about the Alt-Right, pretty interesting.  agent_1:Yeah. I am fearful of those groups normalizing hate speech, sorry if you're alt-right... agent_2:I am definitely not Alt-Right, these groups are scary to me. All the extremist groups are very scary. A man named Tenold wrote personal accounts on a personal level with these groups. Very interesting.	agent_1:If I am alt-right, I do not want my name included with the KKK.

Some people are saying the last jedi underpeformed agent_2:I don't agree with... I liked it a lot! agent_1:We'll just have to hope episode 9 shuts everyone up agent_2:I am sure of it!  That's funny George lucas's wife won an acedemy award agent_1:I know and george lucas didnt! But she did have an influence on vital scenes. Including obi wan's death agent_2:Yeah i know, but still :)  That's cool, that they dubbed it in navajo language agent_1:I wonder if they still had james earl jones. You cant change vader's voice! agent_2:Not really sure! and i soooo agree! agent_1:I think 8.5 billion total revenue makes all the movies pretty successful	agent_2:WOW... that's a lot of money!

Is there anything in particular he is stubborn on?  agent_1:He is a great kid, until he plays Fortnite. Something about that game gets him all jacked up and he acts like a different kid. agent_2:There have been a lot of studies on video games and it's effect on children. The consensus always seems to be that they use it as an outlet.  agent_1:I think listening to the way the other people talk and act affects him. He's usually mild and polite, but when he plays with them, he gets very hyper and surly. I also think it's the change in hormones. agent_2:That could very well be the case. Hormones seem to do something to susceptibility, at least it was for me as a teen.  agent_1:He's also at the awkward, trying to figure out who he is, stage. It's fun to really watch his personality develop. agent_2:It's such a weird place to be in the world. They are starting to take on more adult responsibilities but at the same time are still kids in a lot of ways.  agent_1:Right! He is such a little kid about some things, but he's starting to look at girls differently and it's a weird situation to be in. He used to tell me everything, but not so much anymore. agent_2:Wanting to have some secrets its about right developmentally speaking. Just feeling out some small forms of independence. 	agent_1:His voice has also started to change. He is taking after his father with a super low, bass filled voice.

It holds a Guinness World Records title for the"" Most successful film merchandising franchise."" agent_2:Thats crazy. I wonder if Fox regrets giving Lucas the merchandising rights agent_1:Ooh, I bet they do big time.  Huge mistake on their part.  I can't believe they thought it would be a flop. agent_2:$500k cost them billions and made George a billionaire himself agent_1:I'm happy for him.  What I find interesting is that James Earl Jones only took 2.5 hours to record all of his Darth Vader lines and only got paid $7500.00. agent_2:That is crazy to think about! And the movie wouldn't be the same without his voice. agent_1:You're so right.  Nobody else could have said,""  Luke, I am your father"", quite like him.  lol agent_2:Speaking of Luke, did you know he was originally written as a girl? agent_1:Yeah, I had heard that about Luke.  Did you know that the original light saber prop used by Luke Skywalker is inside the International Space Station? agent_2:I wonder if the astronauts are allowed to play with it"	agent_1:I very much doubt that.

Did you know Wikileaks published the government's plan to shutdown Wikileaks? agent_2:No, but it is seems logical given the nature of government and Wikileak's nature to publish them.   agent_1:True. A man in France once impersonated a government official and was able to sell the Eiffel Tower twice.  agent_2:Yeah, I feel a little bad for the people that fell for it, especially the first one, he was so ashamed that he did not called to police.  agent_1:Me too. The Norwegian government once gave $1 billion to help save the Amazon rainforest.  agent_2:Do you think they will succeed ? I hope so.  agent_1:I hope so too. Do you know much about Einstein? agent_2:I know he was a scientist. Is he German ? agent_1:Yep, he was German. He was once asked to be the president of Israel.  agent_2:Why would they ask him to be president of Israel ? He must have made a ton of money with all those posters with his face.  agent_1:Not really sure. I also saw he was a member of the NAACP. agent_2:So he was actively for civics right, he seems a good man but a quirky one I have heard that he wrote something and put it is a time capsule that will be opened in 6939.  	agent_1:He was a good man and very smart.

You know they published the government's plans to destroy them.  agent_2:That's right. I forgot that he found Wikileaks also. I didn't know that, but I recently learned that the government owns 86% of NV land. agent_1:That's a lot of land to be own by the government, what's their game plan, lol agent_2:Maybe Snowden knows! Apparently governments are to abide by governing principles that are to balance individual freedom and tyranny. agent_1:Yeah sounds suspect. In 2006, the us passed legislation that would protect government employees from being prosecuted for violating the Geneva conventions agent_2:Also sounds suspect. Did you know that Albert Einstein was asked to be Israel's president? But he declined. agent_1:That's deep. Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to invite Albert Einstein to the White House.  agent_2:Yeah, and the letter was intercepted and then the invitation was declined by Flexner. agent_1:Sounds like another administration i can think of. 	agent_2:Einstein was very involved in American politics.

There is also a draft for congress. agent_1:Type of people participate in these things? I think it would be boring.

I stunk up the courts I was so bad.  The longest tennis match in history went on for over 11 hours and was spread over 2 days.  Crazy. agent_2:Was that at one of the big competitions, like an open or Wimbledon? agent_1:I'm not sure.  They once had to use a helicopter to dry the grass courts for the 1969 US open.  Bet that dried it fast. agent_2:That was the year after the first open when a black player won. But no black player has won since agent_1:Wow.  I didn't know that.

Did you know they call kickball soccer-baseball in Canada? agent_2:It is nice to sit outside and watch a baseball game in warm weather. I agree.  I didn't know they call kickball ""soccer-baseball"" in Canada.  That is funny. agent_1:I wonder why they call it that.  I'm always wondered why baseball managers wear uniforms...I guess they can play for their teams if needed.  Interesting. agent_2:Do you know who the baseball player Angel Hernandez is? agent_1:He is actually an umpire.  He has a bad reputation for blowing calls. agent_2:That's what I heard.  And he tried to accuse the Yankees and Joe Torre of discrimination against him.  I think being an umpire must be difficult agent_1:I wouldn't want to be one.  Especially the ref in the NFL who blew that call against the Saints and cost them a chance of going to the super bowl.  You'll have to google it if you don't know about it. agent_2:I heard about that in the news.  Same thing with being a ref in a tennis match or a soccer match.  It's a tough job.  At least there is video playback.  But human error plays a roll always. agent_1:It does.  Did you know that baseball is really popular in Japan too? agent_2:Yes I did.

Do you like dogs? agent_1:I love dogs, they have 12 types of blood agent_2:I had no idea about that.  i guess that means it's hard for them to get blood transfers when they need one.   agent_1:yeah but good things is that there are dog blood drives agent_2:Are there really?  I have never seen or heard about one before. I would definitely take my dog to give blood if I could. agent_1:Yeah not sure which countries have them though. do you know how tou can help dogs in Istanbul? agent_2:I  think I have heard about that country having vending machines for food and water for stray dogs. All that is required for payment is plastic bottles. agent_1:yeah I really like that approach, that is super nice for the dogs and the environment agent_2:I like it too.  America and actually, all other countries, should adopt that approach.  Dogs are very smart. They are the only animal other than an elephant that understands pointing. agent_1:that is true, you are right. google even prefers dogs	agent_2:I am glad to hear that for some reason!

The US has had close relationships with those countries for years. agent_2:Their versions probably don't still use floppy disks for storing like ours does partially agent_1:I wonder if that is for security purposes. Strangely outdated tech. Hm. agent_2:That was my guess too. I find it interesting how many times the White House has undergone renovations. The West Wing wasn't created until 1901, and it was expanded only eight years after that agent_1:It was a modest residence. The guest house is bigger, I hear. I wonder when that was built. agent_2:Who knows? I'm surprised Trump hasn't made any changes to the White House. Solar panels were put on the back by George W. Bush, and I've heard that's not the first time they've attempted solar power agent_1:Carter put them on first. Oil shock and that. Reagan removed them.

Do you watch the world cup?	agent_2:No, but my boyfriend has been trying to get me to.

5432	agent_1:When I was a kid I used to always collect baseball cards. I heard a man found 3 million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic. Have you ever collected baseball cards? agent_2:That's cool.  Sadly, bo I never collected baseball cards.  What about you? agent_1:I love baseball so yes, but none are worth any crazy money. Do you watch baseball at all? agent_2:Yes, I do watch some games.  I read somewhere that managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams, if the need arises.  How wild is that? agent_1:Yeah baseball does have some weird rules. I think its because the sport is so old. My dads favorite team is the cups and they started in 1876! They also had one of the longest droughts ever, 108 years. What is your favorite team? agent_2:My favorite team is the Atlanta Braves and they have been around as long as the Cubs, too.  Both were founded the same year as the Little Bighorn battle.  Wow! agent_1:Both those teams have so much fans. My dad said when the Cubs won in 2016 over 5 million people celebrated in the streets. Have you heard of the cubs curse? agent_2:Yeah, it's pretty funny actually. It started in 1945 when stadium security wouldn't let a man named Billy Sianis stay in the stadium with his smelly pet goat.  agent_1:The best part about baseball is watching the world series. I remember when the red sox came back and beat the Yankees down 0-3. Its crazy how its been going on since 1903. I wonder how many people actually watch it still. agent_2:I think it's still pretty popular.  You know in Japan is so popular, many fans are surprised to discover its status as America's national pastime. agent_1:I dunno because my friend told me that the women's world cup had higher television ratings than the world series. agent_2:Worldwide I think Soccer rules.  But, baseball is still pretty popular, too.  I read somewhere that kickball is called soccer baseball in Canada.  That's kind of strange. agent_1:Speaking of strange I heard that the cubs have employed a pitcher with 6 fingers. I do not know why my dad likes that team agent_2:Yeah, they have had pitchers with 4,5, and 6 fingers on their pitching hand. Uncommon, but totally true! agent_1:Another weird thing about the cubs is the last time they won the ottoman empire was still going. Do you really think they were cursed?	agent_2:I don't know about cursed, probably just bad luck on their part.  	agent_1 dislikes superstition. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['superstition', 'sports', 'sports'].

3727	"agent_1:Hello, are you a comedy fan?  Are you familiar with Ken Jeong's agent_2:Not really but I have heard of the show The Hangover. Some comics are really brutal and I don't like humor that hurts people. agent_1:He is actually a Dr.  He studied at Duke University. agent_2:That is interesting. I wonder why he went from medicine to humor? It's a good thing because he saved the woman in the story. agent_1:Yes, I heard about this awhile back.  A women was having a seizure.  He first thought she was a heckler. agent_2:Hecklers are not funny at all. I went to a comedy show where there were several and they ruined the whole performance. I don't think I could be a comedian you have to have a tough skin. He is good, though. agent_1:It is said that once he realized what was going on, he jumped off stage and into action. agent_2:I suspect that the training never leaves you. I would rather be a doctor but I guess he does really well acting. Comedy is a lot of fun if you don't hurt other people with jokes. agent_1:I'm sure he makes more as a comedian and actor.  After his actions he told the crowd that he checked her vitals and reassured the crowd.  They applaued him. agent_2:I like The Three Stooges type of humor. Or Mr. Bean. I just watched one of his movies and I laughed all the way through. He makes fun of himself, mostly. And it hurts no one.  agent_1:Ken got his break in a comedy contest.  He then moved to LA and performed sets after long days in a HMO clinic. agent_2:That must have been difficult so he must have a real gift for comedy. I will have to check it out.'The empire strikes back'  was a comedy and I did not even know that. I need to keep up these movies. agent_1:YOU SHOULD DO THAT.  DID YOU KNOW THAT BILL MURRAY THINKS ""KUNG FU HUSTLE"" IS THE SUPREME ACHIVEMENT IN COMEDY? agent_2:I don't know Kung Foo Hustle. Bill Murray is funny, though. I remember him on Saturday Night Live. Now that was funny. Especially Gilda Radner and Chevy Chase. agent_1:Bill Murray is an all time great.  I also saw that the Green Lantern movie was originally going to be a comedy with Jack Black. agent_2:The Greeks invented comedy as part of a dramatic performance. I would like to go back and see how funny they were compared to today's comedians."	"agent_1:I didn't know that.

Ballet dancers go through tons of shoes, 4 pairs a week agent_1:Yeah must cost a lot too. Babies are good at dancing too when they hear music agent_2:Yeah and they smile more once they hit the beat, smart agent_1:Yes super sweet. Jackson had a patent on a device that improved his dance moves agent_2:Nice. Do you like soundtracks? agent_1:Yes I do. Did you know Spielberg, when creating the soundtrack for Jaws, played the clarinet? agent_2:the Brother Where Art Thou one is 8 times certified platinum agent_1:Wow! That is impressive. Phil Collins speaks many languages and recorded the Tarzan ST in all of them. agent_2:Yes including german, spanish, italian, and french. Amazing agent_1:I know. The track title in the Batman Begins ST is named after a genius of a bat agent_2:Haha that is super creative. Do you ever read movie reviews? agent_1:I read them sometimes, I mostly rely on Rotten Tomatoes, and you? agent_2:Me too. Did you know Bay's average rating for his movies is just 38% there? agent_1:Wow that low? Movies based on video games also have a low rating there too	agent_2:Yeah it seems.

How about you? agent_1:I love Google, i can't stand other search engines like bing or yahoo agent_2:I refuse to use Bing because I despise Microsoft even more than Google.  agent_1:lol, Google is incredible though, it requires more computing power for one search than it took to send neil armstrong to the moon! agent_2:Yeah, pretty much any kind of personal electronic device these days would put the supercomputers of that period to shame. agent_1:that is very true, a lot has come since back then. How about siri, are you a fan? agent_2:I don't even have a smart phone, so I've never used it. Have you? agent_1:wow, you are daring, i like it! I have an iphone but never use siri, I would rather just google something instead to be honest. agent_2:I'm not really daring, LOL. I just live in a 3G dead zone and I'm self-employed, so I just need a basic tracfone in case I have an emergency on my occasional trips to town. But my laptop is all the Internet connection I need. agent_1:I have a friend like that also, no shame in that. That is perfect though with your laptop because you can still communicate with others if needed. Do you do a lot of amazon shopping? agent_2:A fair amount, although they're another corporation I hate :) I get better deals on supplements and used books. How about you? agent_1:For sure, it was started as a book company in 1994 agent_2:They're a good source of out-of-print stuff, for sure. Library Genesis is also good for obtaining ""unauthorized"" pdfs of a whole lot of books. I always check there before Amazon. agent_1:I will have to check that out, is that legal to use? I am taking my masters and books cost too much agent_2:The uploads are probably copyright violations, but I've never heard of anybody having trouble over downloading from it. And any academic book you want there's a better than 90% chance you'll find it there. Just Google ""Library Genesis"" to find mirror sites.  agent_1:wow, I will do that, thank you! Back to amazon though, jeff bezos has a clock in a mountain that will run for 10,000, i wonder why agent_2:It sounds a lot like something called the Long Now Project that did something similar, IIRC. agent_1:I will have to look into that, that sounds interesting.

That is impressive! agent_1:He is my age and I can't even get out of bed in the morning. He's a marvel. agent_2:Lol, yeah and their shows are like 2 hrs i'm pretty sure, that is so nuts.  Do you attend many concerts these days? agent_1:Not now-too expensive. The first time I saw Led Zeppelin was at a place called The Boston Tea Party. They had just come to America and no one knew who they were. It was a small Club so I got to see them up close. agent_2:That is awesome, they were one of the best ever, very jealous of you.   agent_1:I saw a lot of people there. Andy Warhol was a sponsor. I think I liked BB King the best. But I don't remember Phil Collins. agent_2:Wow, that sounds like an amazing time.  BB King would be awesome to see as well.  I have only been to smaller bands, I did see Radiohead play though, that was pretty cool, but to be honest I mainly went to see the opening band! agent_1:It was easy to see everyone in the Sixties. Tickets were cheap and a lot of people played on the Boston Common. Judy Colling and Joan Baez used to sit on the sidewalk in front of the Harvard Coop and play for free. agent_2:Wow, that is so awesome, most of the music I listen to comes from the 60's, I would have done anything to see Marc Bolan or Syd Barrett perform live.  agent_1:I like Pink Floyd! I don't see that We are the Champions is the catchiest tune ever. That makes no sense. agent_2:Good call! Yeah I don't agree with that at all.

Free-range organic tea? NFL player Steve Smith leaves his cleats on the field after every game. He hopes to raise awareness of homeless people without shoes.

I want to know what secret activities they’re engaged in there. Have that many aliens landed in Nevada? Is that their refueling station? agent_2:Most of that is BLM land leased to ranchers.

I mean, he's not wrong, but a little over the top I'd say! agent_1:I think fan fiction is good. I bet he also complains that people do not write enough or how it is  lonely experience and then also complains about flattery... Seems like an inconsistent thought process. agent_2:Agreed!

Yes, I am a huge fan of Star Wars! I also loved how it was the first major movie to be dubbed in Navajo! I think that is so cool! agent_1:Yeah, that's wild. I guess it takes a pretty small audience to pay for the translation work. agent_2:Agreed. Isn't it also funny James Earl Jones only spent two and half hours recording his lines for Darth Vader? I also can't believe he was only paid $7500! Geez, that's pocket change. agent_1:$7500 is amazingly low. I guess since Darth Vader was masked Jones could just record everything at once in the studio. agent_2:Agreed. Can you also believe that George Lucas' wife at the time, Marcia, won an academy award for her editing on Star Wars and yet George Lucas didn't win an academy award for directing. That is just downright unbelievable! agent_1:A lot of people think the OT was so much better than the prequels because of her influence. agent_2:Yeah it was because of her that so many major changes were made like Leia's good luck kiss, Obi Wan's death, etc. She was truly a big influence! agent_1:I remember thinking just about everything in the prequels' timeline was off, based on the mental version of the past the OT led us to construct. But I'd have to rewatch to nail it down. agent_2:Yeah I would have to watch it as well! So are you also a fan of Chewbacca? I love him. I think it's funny there's a bat species called the Chewbacca bat. That's hilarious! agent_1:I never felt strongly about Chewbacca one way or the other TBH. But I've got to google a picture of that bat to see what it looks like! agent_2:I would like to see it as well. Did you know Chewbacca actually had a wife and two boys? That's pretty interesting! agent_1:I vaguely recall reading something in the Star Wars fictional universe where a young Han Solo stayed with Chewbacca and his mom in their home. agent_2:That's so weird, isn't it? Ha! Are you one of the fans who believes both r2d2 and Chewbacca were secret rebel agents? I kind of think it's an interesting theory.  agent_1:I wish I knew enough about the background to have an opinion, but the last Star Wars I watched was Episode III, when it came out on video.

13792	agent_1:Bruce Lee was so talented. He even won the hong kong cha-cha championship back in 1958! Man of many talents. agent_2:Bruce Lee was great! I loved his movies.  Michael Jackson was also talented.  He has patent on a device that he used in dancing. agent_1:That's so amazing! Even Tupac danced ballet in high school. Would have never known that.  agent_2:True.  Do you like cars?  What do you think of Tesla? agent_1:Yes. Is it just me or is Tesla becoming a very popular car all of a sudden. Toyota owns 10% of Tesla, didn't know that  agent_2:I didn't know that either.  Tesla is growing in popularity. I think it is because of Elon Musk.   agent_1:Elon took a 78$ million paycut in 2014 and returned it all but $1! How crazy agent_2:He is impressive. Did you know he founded Paypal? agent_1:He did? I did not know that! He was smart man. agent_2:He also founded spacex.  I wonder if he'll have space travel for everyone eventually. agent_1:Wow! Who knew. Tesla model s runs linux. Fun fact! agent_2:I certainly didn't.  I like that they are heavily into solar energy. agent_1:They specialize in a lot that I didn't know about. Even powerpack batteries. agent_2:I didn't know about solar roof tiles. I thought solar was just for the cars.	agent_1:You can use them for solar energy I think. Whats really interesting is that Fox news is watched more than cnn and msnbc combined. I would think CNN would be popular.	agent_2 dislikes news. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['news', 'solar energy', 'space'].
2556	agent_1:Hello, do you watch Netflix? agent_2:Hi there, I do sometimes, but don't have an account myself.  How about you? agent_1:I do have an account. Did you know from 9pm-12am, Netflix accounts for 33% of all the bandwidth in North America? agent_2:Holy cow, that is so much bandwidth during those peak hours.  agent_1:I agree. Netflix and YouTube make up half of the peak internet traffic in North America. agent_2:That is crazy, and I think it will even continue to grow in the future.  agent_1:Netflix is worth $2 billion right now. agent_2:Wow, I think back in 2000, they proposed to Blockbuster that it should use Netflix as it's online service, they laughed at the offer.  agent_1:I bet lol. Netflix was started due to a $40 late fee incurred by Reed Hastings. agent_2:Yeah old Reed didn't like those late fees, look what happened since then.  agent_1:Do you like Tom Cruise? agent_2:Yeah I do, I really like 80's Tom Cruise movies.  How about you? agent_1:Me too. I love Top Gun.	agent_2:Yeah Top Gun was one of his best for sure, I always like risky business. 	agent_1 likes movies. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movies', 'entertainment', 'streaming'].
7056	agent_1:Hi do you like animals? agent_2:Hi. I love animals. I have a couple of pets. How about you? agent_1:I also love animals,  I have a dog,  but Ive been asking my husband for a dragon for years	agent_2:I don't think he'll be able to find that. Out of the 20 quintillion animal types on the planet, I don't think dragon's exist.	agent_1 likes hobby. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobby', 'pets', 'dragon'].
13902	agent_1:Do you like sharks?  agent_2:I think they're one of the most interesting animals on the planet plus I enjoy watching Shark Week, how about you? agent_1:I rarely watch it. But it seems like a cool show, what channel is it on?  agent_2:It's on Discovery Channel. It's a yearly event they have with all different sorts of shows that they air. agent_1:I don't think I have that channel. Did you know sharks rescue sailors?  agent_2:I never knew that, I only thought it was dolphins that did that. That is an interesting behavior for a predator. agent_1:It sort of sounds not real to me.  agent_2:Yeah I kind of have a hard time believing it as well. I like watching some of the crazy movies they have made about sharks like The Meg or Sharknado as well. agent_1:Did you know sharks can be trained like dogs to bark?  agent_2:I did not know that. That's another shark fact that I have some skepticism about! agent_1:Yeah, I have a lot of them to be honest. Apparently they also evolved earlier than dinosaurs.  agent_2:That one I can believe, they have been around is some form for a long time. The Megaladon was a huge ancient shark. They think the Great White caused it's extinction because they were smaller and able to get to prey better. agent_1:What about dogs, are you a fan of dogs?  agent_2:I am a big dog person, I have one of my own. I'm allergic to cats so they were never really an option for me. agent_1:I'm allergic to cat hair too! agent_2:Do you have any pets of your own? agent_1:Nah, that is too much of a hassle. Did you know that google prefers dogs to cats?  agent_2:I think dogs are the more social animal so it makes sense for a company to have a dog policy over a cat policy. I know of a few people who have therapy dogs that go to hospitals or even to libraries so that children with reading problems can read out loud to them without feeling embarrassed. agent_1:This is true. By the way did you know that there are 12 different blood types that a dog can have?  agent_2:I did not know that. I do know that the dogs and cats than vets keep as office animals are often used for emergency blood donation.	agent_1:That's pretty cool. I was unaware of that.

8029	agent_1:Hi do you like cats? They are definitely good at hunting vermin! agent_2:Agreed. I do love cats as well as most pets! Did you know the cat used in the opening scene of The Godfather was actually a stray they found on set? I thought that was pretty cool! agent_1:Oh that is super cool. From rags to riches. A cats life must be nice. They spend over half their life sleeping! agent_2:That us true. Ha! I would like to visit one of those cat cafes over in Japan that lets you pay by the hour to drink and play with cats! I bet that's so interesting! agent_1:That would be fun! Also there is a town in Alaska that has a cat mayor! agent_2:Is that so? That's a little odd! Ha! Did you ever hear about the physicist that published his cat as coauthor so he could avoid criticism by writing in first person plural? agent_1:Haha I never knew about that. However I also like dogs too. They were the first species to be domesticated! agent_2:I love dogs as well! It's crazy only dogs and elephants are the only animals that can understand pointing, isn't it? agent_1:Yeah I agree I would think more animals would understand that. Google also prefers dogs to cats which is kind of funny that they declare such a thing. agent_2:I know, right? I wonder if they have vending machines around their buildings that releases water and food in exchange for bottles like Istanbul does. It'd be nice if our country could do that!  agent_1:Yeah probably not a ton of strays in Palo Alto! But yeah I think that is a cool idea to promote recycling.  agent_2:Agreed and help stray dogs as well. I also think its crazy that dogs can't see as many different colors as we humans can.  agent_1:Yeah that is interesting. I think it's funny when owners put shirts on their dogs. They probably put Hawaiian shirts on their dogs in Hawaii! agent_2:Ha! Probably so. You know, I've always loved the term man's best friend. They do so much for humans like companionship, hunting, protecting, pulling and even therapeutic roles, man's best friend is the perfect term, in my opinion! agent_1:Yeah totally agree with you. Did you know that the official business attire in Hawaii is the aloha shirt instead of a traditional suit and tie? agent_2:Is it really? That's kind of funny! Ha! I do know the pallbearers at Billy Mays' funeral wore khakis and blue shirts. That was very nice of them. agent_1:Interesting. In china the gang layered as many shirts as possible and popped their collars! agent_2:Now that's interesting. Ha! I also think it's interesting that button down is when collar tips fasten to the body of the shirt and button up does not. I never really realized that! agent_1:Yeah I didn't know that either. I always thought polo shirts were designed by polo players but they were originally invented by tennis players!	agent_2:Were they really? I figured polo players invented them as well. But you know, in American English, the term shirt is such a catch all term that represents a wide variety of upper body garments and even undergarments. 	agent_1 likes hobby. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobby', 'fashion', 'environment'].
9520	agent_1:Do you like concerts?  agent_2:Sometimes don't really get out much though. What kind of concerts?  agent_1:I like the Ramones to be honest, what about you?  agent_2:Everybody loves Raymond! agent_1:Hilarious. Do you play violin?  agent_2:Nope, i don't play any instrument. Do you? agent_1:I play guitar, piano, and drums. I grew up playing mozart, no lie.  agent_2:Wow that's awesome. I do love music though. I mostly listen to instrumentals. Violin and electric guitar sounds great together.  agent_1:Yeah, they are great. I didn't know that some violins could be upwards of $1 mill.  agent_2:That's ridiculous especially since modern violins were preferred to Stradivarius ones when blind tested.  agent_1:What about poetry, do you like it?  agent_2:Well i use to write a little when i was younger. What about you? agent_1:Not really to be honest.  agent_2:There is a poem that when read forward is depressing but when read backward is inspiring.  agent_1:Did E.E. Cummings write it?  agent_2:Not sure who wrote it but i would like to read it. Did you know that Linkin Park played 324 concerts in one year? agent_1:I did, they were good.  agent_2:Yeah i like them too. shame how things went down. Wow i didn't realize that law suits could be filled if a concert was  bad. agent_1:Yeah, I heard about that with Creed.

One of my favorite characters is Minnie Mouse and I was surprised to recently find out her name is short for Minerva Mouse! agent_1:i like disney though i havent watched a disney film in a while. i do like minnie. she is cute as the dickens. agent_2:Well there's actually a hidden subculture dedicated to finding hidden Mickey mouse images in all things Disney, you should definitely check out! agent_1:i guess if you find a mickey, you win something? if i find one, i guess i should tell others and not keep it secret. agent_2:That's a good point! Ha! Unless they change the locations up!  Are you also a fan of Bill Nye? He actually served as a science consultant on Flubber, believe it or not! agent_1:i guess he knows a bit about the science of hypothetical substances. he is an entertaining fellow for sure. agent_2:Indeed he is! I also think it's amazing that Big Hero 6 was rendered with a 55,000 core supercomputer. That is amazing! agent_1:that is astonishing. i wonder how many processors theyll need for big hero 7. i dint see the other big hero movies. agent_2:Probably a lot more than 55,000. Ha! Did you ever see Wall-E? If so, the name is actually a tip of the hat to Walter Elias Disney himself! agent_1:that is cute. i wondered why they pickt such a strange name for a robot but now i see. but he dint have a mustache. agent_2:You're right, I don't think he did! Ha! I'd like to see Wall-E with factual hair like Kanye West's. I bet that'd be funny. Speaking of Kanye, you know he believes aids is man made?  agent_1:yes Kanye is an oddball when it comes to science.  agent_2:That is true. But he does do cool stuff every now again like the time he gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair at one of his concerts. That was nice of him! agent_1:i think that he undersatnds entertainment good but he doesnt have the knowledge for science.  agent_2:True. I loved how he did an SNL skit where he mocked himself interrupting award shows ironically two years before he interrupted Taylor Swift at an award show. Ha! agent_1:he knew the depths of his depravity and told the whole world first. i think that is honest of him  agent_2:Agreed. Since we're on the subject of rap, are you a fan of Tupac. I'm so glad his music is in the library of Congress of cultural significance. He was a talented musician! agent_1:Tupac is not my cup of tea but the man could rap the street an urban lullaby. Anyway, great chat! agent_2:Indeed he could! I also think Eminem can as well. I'm glad he became a rapper instead of becoming a comic book artist as he wanted to do growing up. Oh what might have been!	agent_1:he could still DO that! the man has got years in front of him and tales of the street to tell.

Apparently baseball managers wear uniforms in case they have to play to replace players. agent_1:I wonder if that's ever happened before? Did you know that baseball use to be referred to as the Fall classics? agent_2:I will research about it later.  No, I did not know that (the fall classics). agent_1:Because in north america it is played during the fall season. 	agent_2:I see.  Thank you for the information.

6552	agent_1:How's it going? Do you know much about VR? Looks like it is not meeting it's potential as an educational tool agent_2:Hello there, I know just a little bit, I heard that is true though, that they don't really have the ability to customize the material to the individual or coach.  agent_1:That seems odd and something that would be easy to fix if the effort was put in. Learning history and geography seems like a perfect fit for VR agent_2:Yeah I think you are right, especially for those children that are strong visual learners.  agent_1:VR does sound like a great tool for those who struggle with time limits agent_2:Yeah I think it has the potential to be.  Do you know much about AI? agent_1:Not much except for what's in pop culture, I definitely couldn't explain Tesler's Theorem that well agent_2:I think I'm about the same, I know IBM's Watson is very helpful in the medical field.  	agent_1:Yea I've heard of Watson and a little about Stanford's ai class which I might have to take a look at when I got the time	"agent_2 likes technology. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['technology', ""IBM's Watson"", 'technology']."
13681	agent_1:Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer? agent_2:No but I figure since he was so good in martial arts moves, dancing would come easy.  What is more surprising is Mr. Rogers learned to break dance on an episode.   agent_1:Lee won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship in 1958. agent_2:Well another actress who won dancing was Emilia Clarke.  She did the funky chicken dance and robot dance during her audition to Game of Thrones.   agent_1:It doesn't seem that that would help her get the part.  Tupac danced ballet in high school. agent_2:Really!  I always thought he was softy in the inside.  Speaking of ballet, there are slippers that made drawings from the dancer's movements.   agent_1:That would look like modern art to me.  Tupac obtained the role of Mouse King in a production of Nutcracker, so he was serious about it. agent_2:Another dance who took his job seriously was tap dancer Bill Bailey he was the first to do the moon walk ever recorded.  This whole time I thought Michael Jackson was the first.   agent_1:I did not know that.  Babies spontaneously dance when they hear music, so I must have lost my sense of rhythm between 1 and 5 years old. agent_2:Well Richard Nixon had a great sense of rhythm, he wrote a piano concerto and performed it live on the Tonight Show.   agent_1:That is incredible!  Ballet dancers can wear out 4 pairs of dancing shoes per week.  Looks like that could find a more durable material. agent_2:Dance is such a beautiful art even parrots are getting into the action.  Parrots are able to dance perfectly in time with music.   agent_1:My daughter used to have an African Grey.  I have seen the bird do it.  My wife plays the piano which is a stringed instrument but because of the hammers can be a percussion instrument setting the beat for the parrot.	agent_2:Do you think parrots can dance to the sound of a piano?

Supposedly she is the youngest self made billionaire ever. agent_2:Yeah I do not know anything about her.  Did you know there was a dwarf planet between Mars and Jupiter?  I had never heard of it agent_1:Kylie Jenner is one of the Kardashians, I believe. I never knew about the dwarf planet between Mars and Jupiter! Does it have a name? agent_2:I am not sure of its name.   I do know that the sunset on Mars is blue!  Is that not weird? agent_1:That would be pretty neat to see! Sunsets on Earth never cease to amaze me. agent_2:Yes they are beautiful.  I love seeing the pictures sent back from Curiosity on Mars - its so sweet it sings happy birthday to itself agent_1:Those rovers are freaking adorable. I have ever thought so. agent_2:Yes.  I thought it was awesome that they used aluminum from the world trade centers on spirit and opportunity agent_1:It's sad that a satellite was lost on Mars due to a technicality. agent_2:Yes.    for sure.

It looks like amazon means exciting news. They are now looking for a site for a second headquarters! agent_1:That's great! Not everyone thinks so though, Amazon can come with difficulties in transportation and shoot up the housing costs of whatever city it's in.  agent_2:They do make an impact wherever they go. I found interesting that there is a building named after the first amazon.com customer agent_1:I heard they're considering Washington as a place for their 2nd HQ, wherever they put the building is going to get a huge boost! I heard they're even considering New York! agent_2:Also Los angeles, atlanta, and Dallas. they are looking for as much as 8 million sq ft agent_1:Don't forget about their original HQ, it was founded by Jeff Bexos on July 5 1994. And it's the largest internet retailer in the world!  agent_2:An in the US they are the most valuable company after Apple and Microsoft, they have really grow so much! agent_1:It's probably thanks to their hard-workers! I heard they walk 7-15 miles each day as apart of their shift. agent_2:that is a lot! agent_1:And the CEO Jeff Bezos built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years! I guess he has the money to do so! agent_2:We can't deny he is full of great ideas. i did not know that IMBD is owned by amazon!! agent_1:Me neither!

I guess they started that in 2018, it sounds like a lot of people on Twitter were upset too agent_1:About Pride Month or something else? agent_2:I think they were mad that one of the rapper's was supporting president Trump, and they were very happy to hear that Disney was making the LGBT ears or something like that, I don't pay attention to Twitter so I'm not a hundred percent sure agent_1:Got it. Yeah, the rapper is Kanye West. Another singer, John Legend, asked West to ""reconsider"" agent_2:Speaking of Disney, what are you like about their movies? Did you know that for instance Minnie Mouse's real name is Minerva LOL agent_1:Nope. Glad they used the nickname, Minnie.

I was not aware it had been so long. It makes me wonder how long I was on MySpace before that.   agent_2:I agree, I wonder why burger king wanted people to unfriend others  agent_1:I was not aware that they did. That's very strange. You'd think they'd rather advertise on the site since so many people are on there. Facebook makes most of it's revenue from advertisements.  agent_2:I understand that to be true also. I cant believe Iceland is using Facebook to rewrite their Constitution agent_1:That seems like a bad idea. People don't think before they type on Facebook and they're willing to be more ridiculous because they are behind a keyboard.  agent_2:Agreed. I have alsways really liked Micheal Jackson, and I knew he did work on the Simpsons agent_1:I have mixed feelings about him. As a pop star he was amazing, his personal life not so much. My understanding is that Freddie Mercury cancelled a duet with him because he insisted on bringing his llama to the studio. agent_2:Yes I understand the feelings, would have loved to see the 50 foot robot though agent_1:He had some very out there ideas. I did know that Eddie Van Halen Played the guitar solo in Beat It free of charge. agent_2:I did not know that either. and that Micheal helped write the soundtrack to sonic 3 agent_1:That seems very odd to me. Thinking back to the Sonic games they do not have music that I would have thought a high profile musician made.  agent_2:I would agree with that, but still good music. I knoew taylor swift removed her music from spotify but not pandora 	agent_1:I wonder why? I use Pandora a lot. I often have it on when I exercise.

I tried to watch a couple of the movies but I couldn't get into them like some people do. agent_1:Did you know Netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth usage in North America from 9pm-12am? agent_2:I didn't know that but it doesn't surprise me. I guess its pretty popular around the world. agent_1:I guess so. Netflix and YouTube make up half the peak internet traffic in North America. agent_2:I watch more youtube than I do Netflix. Which do you prefer? agent_1:I prefer YouTube as well. Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth agent_2:I think Neflix is over rated these days. It use to be pretty neat being able to stream movies. But then the cost went up and its not as awesome. Youtube is free and I can find lots more videos on random stuff. agent_1:I agree. Netflix is worth $2 billion though so they must be doing something right. agent_2:That is true. Do you like the movie Transformers? agent_1:I have never seen it, but I like Megan Fox. She's easy on the eyes. What about you? agent_2:I never watched it seemed to be pretty popular back in the day agent_1:I think it was popular. In the 2007 film, there are 1.53 explosions per minute.	agent_2:Well it was distributed by Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks.

8235	agent_1:Hello there, do you follow the MLS? agent_2:I do, I  think Wayne Rooney is a great acquisition for the leage what about you? agent_1:Yeah I think it was good not only for him and his family but for the league as a whole.  agent_2:I agree, he played at great teams and his an icon of soccer for sure, but there are other great players as well like Ibrahimovich agent_1:Yeah I think that has become the new norm is for world class players to end their careers here in the US.  agent_2:There is also another great player that played before Rooney his name is Roy Wegerle,  agent_1:Yeah I guess Roy was a hell of a player.  I guess he played for 5 different english clubs during his career.  agent_2:He sure was and wat about Eddie Johnson, his been a pro since age 16, he sure has a good level of skill agent_1:Yeah Eddie Johnson and Freddi Adu were touted as being the next big things in soccer.  They both had pretty good careers but not as big as hyped up to be.  agent_2:Well its hard since there is a lot of good players out there, sometimes its just a matter of luck , did you watch the last FIFA World Cup? agent_1:Yeah I get so excited each summer the world cup comes around.  How about you? agent_2:I did, I thought it was a great World Cup, I was rooting for Argentina but I guess France was the best team of the cup overall, I also liked how Croatia played. agent_1:Yeah France had an amazing team and they finally played like it.  Belgium, Croatia, and England did fairly well as well.  I think Japan had some of the most exciting games to watch of all the teams.  agent_2:I agree, those teams were also pretty good and almost made it, Im exited about the World Cup thats going to be hosted in Qatar by 2022 and then in the US by 2026 agent_1:Yeah the Qatar one will be too different for me though.  Watching the world cup in the middle of winter will be strange.	agent_2:It will be weird I bet the players wont notice it thouhg as Qatar must be really hot even on winter time, its too bad the American soccer team isnt as good in the male category as it is on the female one	agent_1 likes sports. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'soccer', 'basketball'].
540	agent_1:Do you know much about politics? agent_2:Just the basics mostly.  Do you know what the 'candy desk' tradition is about? agent_1:I've heard one of the Senators keeps candy in their desk. Pretty cool! Did you know that Since 1900, the taller candidate has won the us presidential election 75% of the time? agent_2:What! No, I did not know that, that is very interesting. 	agent_1:Also, Astronauts vote from space, so the rest of us have no excuse not to make it to an election. 	agent_2 dislikes politics. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'work', 'work'].
1472	agent_1:Hello there, so have you seen any of the Star Wars movies? agent_2:I have seen several. I read Tran who played rose left Instagram after racist messages from fans. agent_1:That is so sad fans are so cruel to people.  I have yet to see her in that movie, I really want to though.  agent_2:Me too. The last Jedi divided it's fans agent_1:Yeah I think each movie does because there are so many of them and they all have their different tastes.  But the personal comments to the actors is just stupid. 	agent_2:Did you know Chloe Bennet changed her last name to get in to US easier	agent_1 likes tv. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['tv', 'movie', 'actor'].
5118	agent_1:Hello,  do you like baseball? agent_2:You bet. Do you know why the managers wear a uniform? agent_1:I believe its because they are able to play in the game if needed. Thats kinda cool,  I hope they never have to though.   agent_2:Yeah it is pretty cool. I wonder if they do that more in Japan where they take the game more seriously agent_1:I hear that they are surprised to know that baseball is an american thing lol  agent_2:Yeah it seems so. Do you know who used to do the scheduling for the major league games? agent_1:Not sure,  who?  A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in an attic!!  lucky guy!	agent_2:Yeah that is amazing. It was a couple who did it for 24 years in a row	agent_1 likes hobby. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobby', 'sports', 'favorite sport'].

I'd like to visit Mi Vida, a beautifully designed restaurant in Washington DC. agent_2:It sounds really nice, and DC is a really fun place to visit I will say that as well.  agent_1:It's got torches on pedestals and it faces the water on the Wharf. The drinks sound yummy too. agent_2:Yeah they do, and fresh guacamole is always so good.  agent_1:I'd try chipotle infused tequila with my guac and chips!	agent_2:Yeah that also sounds super good, I love tequila!	agent_1 likes drinks. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['drinks', 'food', 'travel'].
2794	agent_1:Hello, do you ever watch Fox News? agent_2:I usually don't watch it. I understand that it's popular. agent_1:Fox discussed the possibility of creating a cable channel that would only air the Simpsons. agent_2:That is an idea that might work, but now I figure people are on the Internet. Maybe a YouTube channel? agent_1:Possibly...The gaming website IGN is actually owned by Fox News. agent_2:Oh, I didn't know that. I guess Fox owns a lot of things out there. A gaming site? Hm. agent_1:Yea very interesting. Fox News is watched more than CNN and MSNBC combined. agent_2:I believe it. CNN has its own bias, as does MSNBC. People watch what they want to believe. agent_1:Yep, not a huge fan of CNN because they post so much fake news and are very biased. agent_2:I don't watch CNN. What kind of fake news? agent_1:They just report things that are fake or swayed to the liberal spectrum of politics. Fox News was created by Richard Ailes and Richard Nixon. agent_2:The viewership of Fox skews pretty old. In 2015, the median viewer age was 68 years old. Older people tend to be more conservative. agent_1:That is very old. Did you know there hasn't been a president who wasn't a rep or dem since 1853? agent_2:The two party system is frustrating because the choices are limited. The money backs certainly candidates, and there is little possibility for outsiders to get in. agent_1:I agree. Every president with a beard has always been a republican.	agent_2:I guess that imparts a look of sage wisdom and manliness.  	agent_1 likes hobbies. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobbies', 'news', 'fox news'].

And then one day Richard Nixon broke it LOL he truly is the master in the art of ruining things LOL agent_1:To Funny! Apparently the Senate set up a rule that the Sargent of Arms could round up missing members and carry them into the Senate chamber.  agent_2:Wow that's interesting. You know what I want to do though? I want to raid the candy desk that's in the Senate, they have a lot of good stuff like milky Way's and Mars Bars and jelly beans lol those are my favorite agent_1:Right, haha! It's a shame that women weren't allowed to wear pants on the Senate floor. At least not until 1993, wow! agent_2:That is insane! I'm glad that they fix that because that seems really silly, also I like Michael Jordan's quote. he says that he won't endorse a Democratic candidate because""Republicans buy shoes to""I wish more celebrities would follow in his footsteps agent_1:That's some kind of sentiment, kind of confusing, why not just say he's a Republican, lol! agent_2:Haha that's true. How often do you vote by the way? Did you know that astronauts vote from space? agent_1:Wow that's pretty cool. The indian Government set up a polling booth in the forest, it was full of lions."	agent_2:Well that's cool. And they did that all for just a single voter too!

What about them? agent_1:Well they mimic the sound of car alams, chainsaws and also cameras,  agent_2:Oh, that sounds like the lyre birds. I guess I have heard of them. Birds are neat. The reason they can fly is thanks to their almost hollow skeleton. agent_1:That must be really funny to listen at lol, you know that birds have bones that are so hollow they can even weigh more than their feathers	agent_2:I believe it, especially when some of them are only two inches long.

I'm ready to see birds migrating back north from Mexico; that would be a welcome sight. agent_2:Yea birds are pretty interesting, i find their light weight skeleton fascinating  agent_1:It's hard to believe that their skeletons actually weigh less than their feathers with those hollow bones.	agent_2:Yea, they are quite successful species with over ten thousand species currently living	agent_1 likes animals. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['animals', 'outdoor activities', 'bird migration'].
2387	agent_1:Hey there what do you think about planet Earth? It's amazing that Earth has only one natural satellite aka the Moon agent_2:Oh, really? That is really interesting. agent_1:It is interesting, but something that's sad is that four-fifths of the world's natural forests have been destroyed. We need to do better with the planet I think agent_2:I think so too. I can't believe when the earth was first formed, one day was 5.5 hours long! agent_1:I know right! do you think that days are getting longer overtime? Like will we have a 40 hour day at some point in the future agent_2:I'm not sure, but I hope not, that is way too long! agent_1:What do you think about the United Nations appointing an ambassador to extraterrestrials? I wonder what he does all day, sounds like the most boring job in the world because obviously we haven't had contact yet agent_2:It must be very boring. If we ever do have contact, I wonder if they would tell us?	agent_1:That's a good point! Scary thing about our current trajectory is that Earth will be out of helium by the year 2100, I know that you love him very important for manufacturing things so I don't know what we'll do	agent_2 dislikes job. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['job', 'history', 'revolutionary'].

It originated during the mid-1950s agent_2:yes very much so. agent_1:Until the 1960s rock and pop were considered the same agent_2:right ! and do you know that korea has its own k-pop band which is the most popular musical group in the country agent_1:Yea, Moranbong band I believe 	agent_2:yes thats right. and another cool fact is that the president of indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office ?	agent_1 likes music. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'genre', 'music'].
1334	agent_1:Are you a fan of dance?  agent_2:Sure. I find the movement very aesthetically pleasing. agent_1:They say that babies spontaneously dance to music. I suppose that shows there's something very fundamentally human in dance. agent_2:Not just human! Parrots are able to dance perfectly to music. They speculate it's tied into their ability to mimic. agent_1:Wow, I guess everything with a heartbeat probably feels some impulse to dance. More advanced forms of dance have aesthetic and symbolic value.  agent_2:Did you know Emilia Clarke did the funky chicken and robot dance to audition for Game of Thrones? agent_1:LOL, no. Can't imagine how that would help her get the part? I do know that Bruce Lee once won a cha-cha competition in Hong Kong. agent_2:That's pretty funny. Apparently, Mr. Rogers learned to breakdance on an episode. agent_1:And rapper Tupac Shakur danced in the Nutcracker in high school. Sounds like he and Mr Rogers swapped paths along the way. agent_2:Haha. Like Bill Bailey, an old tap dancer and Michael Jackson! Bill Bailey was first recorded moonwalking in 1955. agent_1:So someone was moonwalking for anyone (literally) moon walked?  agent_2:Ha! That's a funny way to put it. I wonder what the called it back then? Maybe if he had been wearing those ballet slippers that make drawings from the movements we could come up with a better name. agent_1:I hear they go through four pairs of pointe shoes a week. Lots of wear.	agent_2:Soundtracks are important in dance, as well as movies, too.	agent_1 likes movies. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movies', 'music', 'music genre'].
2731	agent_1:Hi!  Do you watch the news? agent_2:Yes I love watching the news. How about you? agent_1:I love the information, but everything these days is so slanted from both sides sometimes it is hard to get. agent_2:Right there is not one source out there that you can trust. I hate the news outlets, but still need to see what's going on. agent_1:Much agreed.  I find that the truth lies somewhere in the middle.  The media tries to create outrage for their ratings. agent_2:Exactly. That's why I watch both CNN and Fox. It kind of helps me to sort through the muck. agent_1:Fox is watched more than Cnn and MSNBC combined.  Kinda crazy to think that. agent_2:I think Fox is slightly more honest than the other two. agent_1:Fox news threatened to sue the simpsons over their constant parody. agent_2:I didn't know that. I don't watch the Simpsons. I know CNN is whining because they can't get any conservative guests. Why would you want to go on their show and be abused. agent_1:Why would a liberal news network want a conservative guest? agent_2:I think so that they can attempt to make them look like a liar or a fool or whatever negative thing they can think of. agent_1:That is true. Did you hear about that time in 1957 when Truman refused to be photographed with Dumbo agent_2:No I didn't. That's funny. Maybe Dumbo wasn't crazy about the idea either. agent_1:Yeah.  Maybe they should have brought Eeyore out agent_2:Okay you've got me there, who's Eeyore. agent_1:He is the Donkey from winnie the pooh. agent_2:Okay now I understand. He'd make a good mascot for the Demos. agent_1:Definitely.  Did you know the red and blue colors started being used in 2000? agent_2:No I had no idea. Did you know that every president with a beard has been a Republican? agent_1:I heard that.  I wonder how many presidents had beards, I know lincoln, but who else?	agent_2:I can't think of any.

I do know that he is Argentinian and a former US Open champion. agent_2:His a great player  he has played against Federer a couple of times, he was the champion back in 2009 as well	agent_1:He is a good example of determination.  I know he had some struggles with wrist injuries and had to have a lot of surgeries.

I was reading that robots are being created to basically be our pets. agent_2:In fact, the word ""robotics"" was invented by a person named Isaac Asimov! agent_1:They apparently even have robots that can break down a chicken with surgical precision. agent_2:Wow! talk about accuracy! The curiosity robot on mars sings happy birthday to itself. It must be very lonely. agent_1:Apparently, robots can be controlled by rat brains and its personality changes depending on which rat is controlling it! agent_2:Human thoughts can also control robots. This paralyzed woman has a robotic arm that she can control with her thoughts. agent_1:Apparently, the military just uses an Xbox controller. agent_2:Artificial intelligence is similar to robots. Artificial intelligence are now able to self drive cars. agent_1:Very cool. Michael Jackson wanted to buy a giant moon walking robot to moon walk around Las Vegas. agent_2:Haha. Did you know that Amazon holds a patent on one click buying? agent_1:I'd love to be Amazon's first customer. He only spent $27.95 and got a whole building named after him. agent_2:I wish I could have an one trillion dollar company named after me too. Big retailers like Best Buy and Target will price match products on Amazon. agent_1:I can't believe Amazon warehouse employees get so much exercise! They walk between 7 and 15 miles every day! agent_2:That is probably how much I walk in a week!

Did you know they partially funded monty python and the holy grail? agent_1:I didn't know that! That's awesome though! Do you know how ""Black dog"" got its name for a song? agent_2:It appears there was a dog wandering around the studio! Interesting, I never knew that! Speaking of recording songs, NWAs straight outta compton was the first album to reach platinum status without a major tour. agent_1:That is so cool. That means it was really good haha. Did you know Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory is the best-selling album of the 21st century? agent_2:That's actually pretty surprising! Two twins in Japan released a rap album when they turned 100. It's never too late I guess. agent_1:Well said! I would love to hear it sometime haha. The Dark Side of the Moon was still one of the top albums in 2014, 40 years after release! agent_2:That's pretty awesome! Reel big fish had to rerecord all their hits for a best of album after losing the rights to their old record label. Ouch. agent_1:Well at least they could remember how the songs went haha. That is crazy how that could happen! agent_2:Yeah, that really sucks.When eddie van halen recorded the solo for beat it he set the speakers on fire! agent_1:That would have been a sight to see lol. He must have been rocking hard! agent_2:Yeah, that would have been insane! Queen's guitarist has a Ph.D. in astrophysics!  agent_1:He looks smart haha. He uses coins as guitar picks too. That must take talent! agent_2:Yeah, he's a pretty interesting guy. Pink Floyd turned a house boat into a floating recording studio!  agent_1:I wonder how that would be on the drums lol. agent_2:Muse's guitarist holds a record for most smashed guitars on tour! agent_1:I wonder how many!

What baseball city you like? agent_2:I'm a Nationals fan. It seems like the Astros made a splashy move by not having to commit tens of millions of dollars in annual salary well into the next decade.  agent_1:I hear ya....do you think Gerrit Cole is worth all the effort to get him? agent_2:I'm not sure, probably not, but let's see. Did you know that the managers wear uniforms because they technically are allowed to play?  agent_1:I never new the managers could also play. Can't remember that happening in ages. I always sort of liked Justin Verlander when he was with the Tigers. The Indians always kicked his butt. agent_2:Yeah. The Nationals have Bryce Harper, he had a bad year last year, but he is still very highly paid.  agent_1:Very true. I was rooting for the Nationals last year, but man they hit the wall late in the baseball season. What happened? agent_2:It happens all the time. Crazy, they just can't close the deal.  agent_1:That sounds an awful like the Indians. I'm 61 years old and have never seen them in a World Series. I'm beginning to think I never will. agent_2:Crazy. Well, they were in the movie Major League.  agent_1:LOL....yep...and with Charlie Sheen playing for them in that. Sheesh. Hey maybe the Nationals and the Tribe will play in the world series this year....ya never know? agent_2:That would be cool. Did you know that up until 2005 a married couple scheduled all of the games for the year?  agent_1:I've never heard that before! I wondered what happened after 2005?

They carry so much information and resources and services. agent_1:i worry about the internet. i think that it could be addictive and that i might lose myself in it. the clicking, the constant clicking. agent_2:That is definitely a valid concern. What is weird is that humans are the minority on the Internet outnumbered by automated software programs. agent_1:i did not know that. we are monitored all the time. even these very chats that we do could be handled by bots in the future. then what? agent_2:Yes that's a good question I'm not sure what would happen then. One cool thing is that in Finland everyone has the right to an Internet connection.	agent_1:i think that is great. people need to be connected for work and school and also to make friends. maybe not bot friends though.	agent_2 likes social media. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['social media', 'technology', 'Internet'].

Did you know there hasn't been a president who wasn't a republican or democrat since 1853? agent_2:Wow I did not know it has been that long. I really think Bernie should run as an independent and not as democrat. The fear is always splitting the vote, but that happens anyway. agent_1:Yep that's true. Every president with a beard has always been a republican. agent_2:Really? I guess you're right. Of course the gop used to be completely different than the mess they are today. Only recently I discovered GOP stands for grand old party... agent_1:Oh wow I didn't know it stood for that either. The last time a republican was elected president without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was back in 1928. agent_2:Crazy, although I don't think there will be a Bush in 2020. Did you know when Hillary was in college she was president of young republicans? agent_1:That's hilarious. I did not know that about her.  agent_2:Yeah, the Republican party was a lot different more recently than people think. In fact Nixon was the only president ever to propose a guaranteed min income. Now people would probably like to reduce min wage to $2 an hour or something crazy.  agent_1:Oh wow I didn't know that either. I saw the red and blue colors associated with each party didn't start until 2000. agent_2:That is crazy. So recently yet it feels like they've always been that way. I think they should change the voting system so the popular vote counts for more. agent_1:Yea I'm not too sure what would work these days for the election.  agent_2:Elections are a mess, not just presidential. A dog has not only won an election for mayor but served as a mayor for 13 years! Dogs don't even live much past 13 lol. agent_1:I agree. LOL - that's pretty funny! During the 2012 US elections, international observers were blocked from the polls in nine states. agent_2:I can only imagine what 2020 is going to be like. Hopefully by then they start allowing you to vote online. I can't imagine it would be that hard. In Oregon elections are done by mail. Online would be a natural progression. agent_1:I agree. Since 1900, the taller candidate has won the election by 75%. agent_2:I guess if you're short it's barely worth running. Subconscious perceptions most likely or it's just a fluke. agent_1:LOL yep. I heard that is actually the case for interviews too.	agent_2:There are certainly some weird facts. The faster blinker has in debates has lost every presidential election since 1980.

Do you like movies? agent_2:I like movies, it is a form of art. .  agent_1:This is interesting..Even though spartacus had a cinematographer, stanley kubrick took the camera away from him and did it himself.  agent_2:You have to do it yourself, he was very talented, I saw some of his films, but never Spartacus, is it good ?  agent_1:It is! But this is interesting too..even though he did almost none of the work, when spartacus got the academy award for best cinematography, it went to the credited cinematographer, and not kubrick. agent_2:Probably, some kind of union thing, like he was not an official cinematographer.  I wonder if they gave him something for it.  agent_1:Thats a good question! No woman has ever been nominated for the academy award for best cinematography. agent_2:I guess it is because there is not many female cinematographer because they would not hire them. Sexism still exist.  agent_1:That is terrible. A woman has never even been nominated. agent_2:Yeah, do you see movies made by a woman ? agent_1:I haven't paid attention to that. I'll have to now. Cinematographer roger deakins has been nominated 13 times for the best cinematography oscar, and has never won. agent_2:He was good but not enough, did he do any comedies ? I like those kind of film.  agent_1:I don't think he did. Do you like Bill murray? Bill murray thinks kung fu hustle is ""the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy"". agent_2:I like Bill Murray, Chinese comedies can be really funny. But I never saw kung fu hustle. Did you ? agent_1:no, not my type of movie! I do like Jack black though. The green lantern film was originally going to be a comedy starring jack black agent_2:That would have changed the tone of the movie, he is very slapstick.  agent_1:Some of his stuff is good, Some bad. Did you watch 3rd rock from the sun?  agent_2:I did when I was young, it was good but not memorable, not like Seinfeld.  agent_1:3rd rock from the sun won the golden globe for best comedy series in 1997, beating seinfeld, friends, and frasier. agent_2:That is surprising and not surprising at the same time, we don't know what will stand the test of time, disco was not forever.  agent_1:True! Wow! Comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows since its creation in 1989 agent_2:You have to try new thing and not be afraid to admit your mistakes. Comedy central would have been bankrupt if they continued to produce those 100 unfunny shows.  agent_1:True, I learned this the other day..The creator of the python programming language named it partly to honor british comedy group monty python agent_2:Do you like Monty Python ?

Were you a subscriber even back when their whole business model was about DVD rental by mail and not an online platform? agent_2:I was! I think it was in 2007 when they started adding streaming features. agent_1:It's interesting to think how differently the company could have been if decisions played out differently. Like Blockbuster declining to buy them many times, and now they're worth many times over. agent_2:Exactly! A purchase of $50 million that is now worth $2 billion. That is just CRAZY! agent_1:And I feel like that doesn't even big to desribe how huge Netflix is still. Netflix accounts for a third of ALL bandwith in North America from 9pm to 12 am! agent_2:Which is honestly just nuts. And when you combine Netflix and youtube, it's half of the peak internet traffic in North America alone! agent_1:I was surprised to learn recently though, that despite how huge their online platform is, they still do DVD rentals! And spend 20 times more on postage than their bandwith. agent_2:True - but I think they might need to start paying more attention to what they are spending - they racked up $21.9 billion in debt as of Sept 2017 trying to get content! agent_1:That's certainly a lot of money! Although at least it's an investment and will come back to them. On the other hand, I remember a decade ago, Tom Cruise spent $10 million on an underground bunker to protect himself from aliens, what a nut. agent_2:I stopped liking him when he went all about Scientology. I much prefer other actors now, like Peter Dinklage. agent_1:I've never heard of him, does he do a lot of action movies? I like Tom Cruise because of movies like Top Gun and Cocktail but I'm always interested in expanding my preferences. agent_2:Actually, Peter Dinklage plays Tyrion Lannister on Game of Thrones!  agent_1:Oh wow! That's a beautiful show I've been meaning to watch, it's filmed in Ireland I think! And from the limited parts I've seen the scenery is gorgeous. agent_2:Yes. It is my most favorite show - which it definitely has earned with all of its Emmys - 47 to be exact! 	agent_1:That's a whole lot!

Did you know that Jupiter's moon Ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun. agent_2:i did not, there is a planet 455 light-years away that might have the building blocks of life agent_1:That's amazing! As long as it's not the planet where shards of glass rain sideways at 4500 mph! agent_2:Not to mention on that same planet the temperature is 2000 degrees Fahrenheit.  agent_1:That definitely sounds like Hell to me!	agent_2:Lets talk about Luke Skywalker next. He is played by Mark Hamill and was originally written as a woman. 	agent_1 likes movie. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'astronomy', 'planets'].
5539	agent_1:Hi, how are you? agent_2:Good! Do you like baseball? agent_1:I do like it. Do you? agent_2:Yes there are interesting facts about baseball, like the number of balls used in a season: 160,000!! agent_1:Wow, that's a lot! The Nationals missed the playoffs last year too! agent_2:I looks it was a difficult season for them, they did score but against one of the teams in the bottom, the Marlins agent_1:They had a really great lineup that really underpreformed. It was a shame they couldnt perform under their new manager. agent_2:that is tough, they were basically depending on other teams to collapse, the braves and the Phillies agent_1:The Braves over performed and the phillies did too. It would be tough to win that division with those two ahead of you. agent_2:Talking about the world series, i found it funny that in 2014 a great song was banned by 2 san francisco radio stations, do you know why? agent_1:I do not know, why? agent_2:it was the series between SF giants and new orleans Royals, so they banned Royals by Lorde, i think that is a great song agent_1:HA! That's funny. Like watching babe ruth trying to steal a bag... agent_2:How is that? Tell me about it! agent_1:Babe Ruth was a large man. He was not the fleetest of foot. He was caught stealing to end game 7 of the 1926 world series! agent_2:that is funny!! talking about babe ruth there was a pitcher, a female one banned when she struck out Babe ruth and Lou ghering.. kind of unfair!  agent_1:yeah! THat's sexism! Seems like something they would do in the 20s and 30s though...	agent_2:That is true, i think she did something incredible. And about women I was surprised to learn that the world series had a lower rating compared to womens' world cup	agent_1 likes sports. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'favorite sport', 'baseball'].
723	agent_1:I have never heard of Fanfest, agent_2:Hey! What is FanFest? lol agent_1:I guess its where the hall of famers meet, At first I thought it said hall of farmers, lol agent_2:Ok. I honestly never heard of. Do you play video games? agent_1:No, But I did not know they were first designed for the military agent_2:It could be for training purpose. I'm wondering why Australia has more banned games than China... It means some US games also banned... It's quite strange.  agent_1:it is like kids in korea being banned playing games after 12 agent_2:after or before 12? If after 12, why is it so? I used to play a lot when I was child. I'm not surprised that video games make more money abbually than all films from Hollywood. agent_1:But would you categorize them as an art form? agent_2:Interesting question. I don't think this is any sort of art. It could be kind of sport. I more support this point of view. How about you? What's your opinion? agent_1:I really not did get into them, But I would consider them an art form agent_2:It could be. At the same time it would be easy to define popularity of such art. For example, it could be a reason why the rating system was involved in video games. agent_1:Maybe I will just go to the fanfest and try the Pitching tunnels, can you throw well agent_2:Ok. Do you watch or play any sport? Like softball or baseball? agent_1:I only play have you heard of any of these players like, Davey Johnson? agent_2:Yes. He played in 1970s, right? Or maybe 1960s... I don't remember. agent_1:I have no clue, But I love the name Rollie Fingers. agent_2:Baseball is fun to watch. I like it. However, I always have difficulties to hit a ball hahaha  agent_1:maybe you should go to the show you can get a medal Maybe agent_2:Medal would be too much significant achievement.

6267	agent_1:What do you think about the Orioles and the signing of Alex Cobb? agent_2:well I think theyre doing what they need to do but I don't know much about baseball, do you? agent_1:I know a bit, I tend to follow some of the games and I think that it was a good call, baseball is an interesting sport indeed, many cool facts about the game agent_2:oh ya for sure, like how the MLB uses 160k balls in a given year for all their games agent_1:Thats a lot of balls, just like a single couple used to schedule all of the 2430 games of the league, seems like a lot of hard work agent_2:that does seem like a lot of work, did you hear that a 17 year old girl struck out Babe Ruth, I wonder what happened to her agent_1:Really? a 17 year old struck out one of the greatest players of the history of the game!!! thats crazy!! agent_2:yup, she should have gone pro, do you know what happens if youre in the outfield and catch a ball with your hat in baseball? agent_1:No, what happens if you do that? agent_2:well you apparently get 3 bases, I never knew that agent_1:Really? I wonder why it doesnt happen often, I havent seen it, that would be interesting to see though.  agent_2:nope I think they should do that more, do you like the Yankees? agent_1:I think they are a great team, the team has a lot of history for sure, do you like them? agent_2:I do actually, they win a lot and I like winning teams haha, I guess they were created in 1901 agent_1:Its a winning team for sure lol, you know that in 1973 pitchers just swapped families permanently, that seems really odd agent_2:haha wow that is odd, pretty dumb how Ben Affleck refused to wear a Yankees hat because he was a red sox fan agent_1:It does seem dumb but I guess I can respect that, he must feel identified with his team, you know that a player got suspended because he refused to get a haircut!! agent_2:wow that seems dumb! kind of weird that their uniform doesn't put names on the backs, they say it takes away the attention from the team	agent_1:Yeah so what do you think about the World Series? its been played for more than a hundred years a lot of history there	agent_2 dislikes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'pitching family', 'baseball'].

I heard the main focus was creativity agent_1:I sure can, so 4 American orchestras are playing on the festival, the music is great and presenters a re good as well, all the orchestras are famous and skilled so I can see why the main focus is creativity	agent_2:Who were some of the present artists?	agent_1 likes music. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'music festival', 'music'].

What do you think about them? agent_1:Not much. Did you know there is a jellyfish that is immortal?  agent_2:I would not want to cross paths with that. I think there has to be something that could kill it. agent_1:I'm not sure, I don't think that can be real, can it?  agent_2:I don't think so, maybe I will look it up lol. One thing I wouldnt cross either is the black swallower fish, have you heard of that one? agent_1:Me either. What about shoes, any interest?  agent_2:I love my shoes! I like nike mostly, how about you agent_1:I'm more of an adidas fan, but I have some Nikes.  agent_2:Did you ever have the stephon marbury shoes back in the day? agent_1:No, but I had some air jordans?  agent_2:Nice, I love air jordans. The marbury shoes were sold at Steve and Berrys for like 15 dollars each. They both don't exist anymore agent_1:Wow, that is pretty cheap, is that on an inflation adjusted basis?  agent_2:I am sure they are more costly now on ebay since they are so rare. Marbury promoted them when he was a star NBA player and never took a dime to endorse them, pretty cool agent_1:Yeah interesting. Well, I didn't know that Apple had a clothing line in 1986, did you?  agent_2:I did not know that, that would be some cool clothing to wear, I think I may go check it on ebay.

Have you? agent_1:No I saw the original one but I didn't see the newest one, my friend side and said it was really bad so I wanted to see your opinion agent_2:Ok, I do like SOME horror, but I usually pick and choose. I liked The Shining, The Omen, The Exorcist. Rosemary's Baby. What about you? agent_1:Yeah those are all good movies. I also liked Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street. The new Halloween note took in about $89 in only 3 days, so it was definitely popular agent_2:I haven't seen those. I think that remakes are risky. The comparisons are inevitable. agent_1:Yep it's always hard to beat the original. And yes the new Halloween movie is actually being released on the 40th anniversary of the release of the first one agent_2:I would rather watch the original. It probably has charm. The new one is probably too slick.  agent_1:Yeah I think the original is going to be the best. Did you know that Stephen King actually thinks that the movie Bambi should be a horror movie? agent_2:He was traumatized as a child. That movie did have death, so it could be scary. Anyway, he turned his trauma into a career.	agent_1:Well that's really good for him! Do you think that horror movies actually burn almost 200 calories per movie?

10950	agent_1:Good Afternoon!  I love going to concerts, seeing my favorite bands, music live - how about you? agent_2:Hello, I do as well though I don't get to go often. I have been to a few recitals in my day too. agent_1:I used to go to shows a lot more that I do now, kids and family will have that affect!  And, I like smaller venues - definitely not areas or stadiums! agent_2:I prefer smaller settings as well though I would love to attend a concert in an amphitheater. In Croatia there is a roman amphitheater that they still use as a concert venue. agent_1:Nice!  Europe has so much history and the engineering / architecture was so great, that doesn't surprise me that a venue would still be in use - amazing! agent_2:True. In 72, Pink Floyd recorded a live concert at the amphitheater in Pompeii with no audience at all. agent_1:That's strange - makes me wonder if you play a concert for no audience - is it really a concert? agent_2:Good question. Are you a fan of Creed's music? Four people at one of their concerts in 2002 sued them because it was so bad. Yikes! agent_1:I am not a Creed fan, or that genre.  So I can totally understand why fans would be disappointed enough to sue - but honestly, what were they expecting?!!?!?!? agent_2:I guess the opposite of that would be Linkin Park who played 324 concerts just in 2001. They were definitely a success back in the day.	agent_1:Pretty sure I was at at least one of those LP shows in '01.

4156	"agent_1:Have you seen Kevin Spacey in the ""Billionaire Boys Club"" movie? agent_2:I haven't seen it, actually. Is it any good? agent_1:I haven't. I heard that it's opening was a career low opening day total for Spacey, though. It's because of all the bad accusations against him, I think. agent_2:I saw him in the movie Baby Driver, but the accusations are definitely a deterrent for some people with how widespread #MeToo has become agent_1:Yes, I actually haven't seen him in a movie since American Beauty. I watch movies on Netflix sometimes. Do you? agent_2:I have to be in the mood since I like to read and listen to a lot of books. I tend to create a watchlist on Netflix faster than I can watch things, but I like how convenient it is. I can't imagine having to rent movies from Blockbuster agent_1:Netflix is really popular now. I hear it accounts for a third of all the bandwidth in North America during late night. agent_2:I think the shows and movies help people unwind now, and there's no commercial breaks. Combined with YouTube, the two account for half the bandwidth in North America agent_1:I hear Netflix actually spends more on postage than on bandwidth. The owner started the company after being annoyed by a late fee of his VHS movie rental. agent_2:I would be annoyed about a rental fee that's higher than it costs for the VHS. It's still strange to think that people still use the rental service, but I guess internet connection isn't always the best in some places agent_1:Yes I think maybe it's from parents getting stuff for their kids to watch while they can watch streaming Netflix at the same time. agent_2:Netflix is capable of streaming on more than one device at the same time depending on the subscription. Either way, it's still better than if Blockbuster had bought Netflix agent_1:Of course. I think some wifi can't handle that, though. Yes, I heard they actually turned down buying Netflix. It was for much lower of a price than it's worth now, too! agent_2:I think their value went up once they started creating their own content. It's part of the appeal now to keep users loyal agent_1:Yes, Netflix creating their own content seems like it's part of a cinematography revolution or something! agent_2:Maybe if they team up with cinematographer Roger Deakins, his 14th nomination for the Oscars will be the one that finally wins. Losing 13 times would be hard agent_1:Yes, that would be hard. On the bright side, I bet not many cinematographers have been putting out such mention worthy work for so many years! agent_2:Not since James Wong Howe back in the 1940s. He was Chinese before finally becoming a citizen, but he used techniques such as low lighting and wide-angle lenses before it was popular"	agent_1:Sounds like a very talented and revolutionary cinematographer.

Is it true about their rail system not being there? agent_2:I think it is! I heard without cars, they use domestic flights to travel.	agent_1:That is interesting, it certainly helps people getting over their fear of flying lol.

6517	agent_1:When I previously thought of virtual reality I thought of gaming, but have you heard about its uses in the educational revolution? agent_2:Hello there, same here, no I haven't seen too much about the educational side though.  agent_1:Through virtual reality, children will be able to attend virtual schools and learn how they want. Through their tablets or visually. agent_2:That is really cool, I guess they can get access to things and places that they never would have been able to before.  agent_1:Yes, for example if they want to learn visually they can use the headsets to travel to ancient Egypt and watch the pyramids get built! agent_2:Wow, that is even cool for me and i'm an adult!   agent_1:It is.  It is becoming a lot more affordable too.  It used to be over $1000, but in two or three years should be less than $100. agent_2:I think you are right, I think more schools will have these in the coming years as well.  agent_1:Yes, and can even use them at home to educate.  The program will allow the parents to keep tabs on their children to see how they are doing. agent_2:And I think all of those safety features for parents are a must with all technology these days! agent_1:Yes, safety and affordability.  With a lot of companies like Google, Lenovo, Magic Leap, and Facebook involved you know there will be an affordable and great product. agent_2:Yeah and I think there will be profitable business there as well so its win win for those companies as well.  agent_1:Yes, agreed.  You even have a company like Lockheed Martin that can take kids on a virtual reality tour of Mars! agent_2:Wow, now wouldn't that be something.  I wonder if they will be able to do that with planets further out in the future?	agent_1:With all of those companies and a company like Facebook worth over $100 billion I am sure they sky the is the limit.	agent_2 likes tech. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['tech', 'technology', 'product'].

It must be incase of injury or something. It's a strange rule. Did you hear the story about the man who found a bunch of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic? They were worth 3 million dollars! agent_1:Oh man can you imagine going through stuff and all of sudden you come across a haul like that?! I would probably have a heart attack right then and there.  agent_2:I couldn't even imagine, I would be so shocked. In japan baseball is very popular, and they are surprised to hear it;s status as america's national pastime? agent_1:I wonder why they were surprised. Baseball has always been such a popular game here in the states.

I wonder if it will have a special lane?  When I heard that I thought of the Night Bus from Harry Potter. agent_1:I have no idea. All of Japan's highways are tolls so it cost roughly $300 to cross the country. agent_2:That is a lot of money.  Iceland doesnt have a public rail service, so people without cars take flights between cities. agent_1:That would stink to not have public rail service. I can't imagine having to fly everywhere. agent_2:Same here.  But I guess if we want to travel across the country we do, but not within our own states. agent_1:Yes. The first king to travel around the world was from Hawaii. agent_2:I didnt even know Hawaii had a king.   agent_1:Me either lol.

So that must mean, they must stay in shape too right? agent_2:that is interesting, do you think they ever played in a game ?	agent_1:I don't think so, I don't watch too much baseball and I don't collect cards either, but I might reconsider seeing how valuable they are when a man found three million dollars worth of cards in his grandfather's attic!	agent_2 likes hobby. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobby', 'sports', 'baseball'].

I think they believed that elections would lead to an oligarchy.  agent_1:I wonder how that would work today though. agent_2:Yeah I don't think that would work very well, but then again, maybe it would work better, who knows.  agent_1:yeah there is no knowing there.

It's a shame that people have to resort to shooting students as well as teachers. It's not even safe to go to school anymore agent_2:I wish there could be non-polarizing discussions on it between society and politicians agent_1:There needs to be a conversation about it. Maybe it will reach out to people and the shootings will stop. Parents shouldn't have to worry about what's going to happen to their children when they send them to school. agent_2:I guess it's important to vote for politicians who care about the people they represent and not lobbyists or the party line agent_1:Exactly. All certain politicians care about is money.They don't care about what is best for people. If they did, things would be better and maybe the violence would end. agent_2:Yep, in ancient athens officials were appointed by lottery to avoid an oligarchy agent_1:Maybe that should be done here in the U.S. Most likely Trump wouldn't be in office if the elections was done by lottery. agent_2:No, unfortunitly voter turnout hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years so that may be why the country is in such bad shape agent_1:You're probably right. Some people feel like their vote doesn't count so they don't bother. Then again, maybe the taller candidate won as the article claims. That does explain how certain people are elected agent_2:I think Nevada has it right with the option ""none of the candidates"" as a voting option agent_1:I think they have it right too. It gives you the option not to vote for people you don't think are good enough to be in office agent_2:People vote for interesting things, Austin TX voted to rename their garbage dump to Fred Durst agent_1:They really do. I wonder why they wanted to name it after him. I also wonder why all men couldn't vote until 1918 agent_2:I don't know, I also don't know why there are polling booths in forests filled of lions in India agent_1:I don't know why there are polling booths like that either. It also never occurred to me that astronauts can vote from space agent_2:That's nuts. Jupiter's moon ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun agent_1:It is. I find it strange how venus doesn't have seasons agent_2:Yea, Uranus is strange too since it rotates sideways agent_1:Exactly. That is very strange.

It looks like Stephen Strasburg is doing well since healing from his injury. agent_2:you know that ended in a 5-1 win for Strasburg and the Washington Nationals at Citizens Bank Park and gave the team its first five-game winning streak since the end of May. I was so surprised, can you imagine 5:1... agent_1:That's amazing. I can't believe the Nationals have a 19 year old rookie player who is doing so well. agent_2:yes that is amazing. He fell behind a couple times and got right back to throwing strikes. He did really, really well. Do you know Aaron Nola? agent_1:I have never heard of him. Is he a good player too? agent_2:Yes hi is. he Phillies' Aaron Nola has been one of the National League's best and is right behind Max Scherzer and the New York Mets' Jacob deGrom in the Cy Young conversation, that's the information I have learned agent_1:That's something. I thought it was interesting that all othe game scheduling was done through a married couple until 2005. I wonder who handles it now. 	agent_2:yes me either. Then it was a nerve impingement in his neck.

Supposedly she is the youngest self made billionaire ever. agent_2:Yeah I do not know anything about her.  Did you know there was a dwarf planet between Mars and Jupiter?  I had never heard of it agent_1:Kylie Jenner is one of the Kardashians, I believe. I never knew about the dwarf planet between Mars and Jupiter! Does it have a name? agent_2:I am not sure of its name.   I do know that the sunset on Mars is blue!  Is that not weird? agent_1:That would be pretty neat to see!

I love seeing the pictures sent back from Curiosity on Mars - its so sweet it sings happy birthday to itself agent_1:Those rovers are freaking adorable. I have ever thought so. agent_2:Yes.

I read about that on facebook.  Do you use that site? agent_1:I try not to.

And you? agent_1:I also enjoy it when I can.  A while ago, ancient babylonians understood astronomy so well, they were able to track planets with mathematical precision!  agent_2:Its amazing that they were able to do that without the modern optics and computers we have today.  It seems the interest in astronomy is so great that even the Vatican has an observatory!  agent_1:I went to the Vatican a few years ago, and did not know that!  Wi-fi was actually a byproduct of research into improving astronomy imagery. agent_2:I doubt the younger generation would know how to live without WiFi.  They seem to live their life on the internet via social media.  Did you know that Finland has made access to the internet a human right? agent_1:I did not know it is a right in Finland! I agree with too much reliance now.  I don't know how many will need this, but there is 3g service and internet capabilities at the peak of mount everest.  So you can take the selfie up there before passing out.   agent_2:LOL.  What amazes me is how people assume they can do anything, even on their employer's internet!  Did you happen to hear about the criminal investigation that shut down the Sunspot Observatory in NM? agent_1:I remember when that was going on, didn't hear too much why initially.  I know there were theories of Aliens? agent_2:Well, it was not E.T downloading illegal materials; it was the janitor!  I am glad the facility director got the FBI involved. agent_1:Definitely glad the FBI got involved!  That janitor claimed someone been entering there to steal their internet service!  Lol I don't think E.T would stop there now! agent_2:Thankfully that is over and the observatory is back up and running.  And, I hope they have upgraded their internet security!  Do you think there is life out there that we do not yet know about? agent_1:I do think how vast the galaxies are, that there has to be life somewhere else!  In the X-Files aliens started to colonize Earth in 2012.  That hasn't happened yet! agent_2:I find it interesting that the U.N. already has a contingency plan in the event aliens do make contact.  People have been fantasizing about forever; an ancient Greek wrote about plant like aliens on the moon over 1800 years ago! agent_1:Wow that is a long time ago, and where humans were thinking about that!  Tom Cruise believes in aliens, he built an underground bunker to protect himself from E.T. agent_2:Tom Cruise may be a popular actor but he also has very unique beliefs!  Perhaps aliens are already here spying on us!  Did you know that humans are a minority  on the internet, being outnumbered by bots? Perhaps some are there collect info for their home world? LOL agent_1:Lol!!  I did not know that!  Starting to get me thinking now!  I do know I am one of the 7% that do try my best to read the full terms when buying something on the internet.  lol	agent_2:I buy from a few online vendors who's terms I have read.  While I may find a cheaper price at an unknown ecommerce site, is it real and what are the terms.  Online, I do occasionally play chess with other players from around the world.  Did you know the president of the world chess federation believes that chess was invented by aliens?	agent_1 likes hobbies. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobbies', 'travel', 'Vatican'].
489	agent_1:Hi are you a fan of Star Wars? agent_2:My son is, so I know a little bit about it. agent_1:Nice!  Did you see the first movie when it came out in 1977?  I remember going to the theater to see it. agent_2:No, I did not.  My son went with his friends. Apparently, Star Wars was dubbed in Navajo in 2013. agent_1:There must have been a big enough market for them to do that.  They have the money to do it that's for sure.  Just the box office alone the Star Wars franchise has brought in over $8.5 billion dollars! agent_2:20th Century Fox did not think that Star Wars was going to succeed.  Do you know what happened to Star Wars' licensing and merchandising rights? agent_1:Didn't George Lucas get them somehow? agent_2:Yes, because they did not want to pay additional directing fee to Lucas.  agent_1:Nice.  He scored then big time because the entire Star Wars franchise is estimated to $65 billion dollars! agent_2:20th Century Fox avoided to pay additional fee of only $500k to Lucas.  They were willing to give the licensing and merchandising to him.  Someone got fired at the company, I'll bet. agent_1:You know it!  George Lucas' wife Marcia won an academy award for editing the film! agent_2:I heard about it.  She was talented.  By the way,  Marcia is no longer married to Lucas. agent_1:Whoa!  I didn't know that.  Maybe George doesn't have as much as that $65 billion as I thought.  Yikes. agent_2:It's okay.  Marcia is entitled to the money too.  She want the award, remember?	agent_1:Yes!  lol  James Earl Jones took only 2.5 hours to record all of the parts for Darth Vader for the original movie.	agent_2 likes movie. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'award', 'family'].
5796	agent_1:hey there what do you think of the game of baseball? agent_2:Baseball is ok. I remember hearing my older relatives calling the World Series the Fall Classic. It sounds very retro. agent_1:haha that is retro, I never knew that baseball managers could start playing if they wanted to, and thats why they wear uniforms agent_2:Yes I just recently learned that, too, and thought it was very interesting! It might be like an embarrassment to the team to have to bring in a manager like that, though. What do you think? agent_1:haha ya I would think so, can you believe that baseball is super popular in Japan, I had no idea agent_2:Yea, when I worked for Target a few years ago I remember they'd have Japanese baseball on in the break room along with other TV's with American Sports. agent_1:ah that is interesting, I wish I was like the guy who found millions of dollars of baseball cards in his attic, now that would be a surprise agent_2:As long as I'm not like the guy found in a beer cooler behind a concession stand at a baseball stadium. He was found just before a braves game, too. agent_1:ya I heard about that that was crazy, did you ever play kickball as a kid? I guess it's called soccer-baseball in canada agent_2:Canadians do have some different ways about them. Soccer-baseball does sound hilarious. So does poutine, though. agent_1:haha well I do like poutine, but I think that yes soccer-baseball sounds incredibly dumb haha agent_2:I wonder if they have poutine at American baseball games? I heard they started a poutine restaurant in California. agent_1:wow that sounds delicious right now, do you ever shop at Target btw? agent_2:I like Target better than Walmart, although I don't know about the corporations as a whole and how they do business. I hear more about Walmart being unfair...don't really ever hear that about Target but who knows, I guess... agent_1:ya I don't really know, I do go to target and apparently Vermont is the only state that doesn't have a Target in it agent_2:That's very interesting. I wonder why Target isn't in Vermont, yet. Also, I wonder if Walmart is in Vermont, now? Maybe they have Bi Mart...although it's not very upscale for Vermont! agent_1:haha that'd be funny to see! what is screwy is a state senator actually works at target in order to make enough money to get by	agent_2:I heard recently that eighty percent of the supplements sold in places like Target contain NONE of the advertised herbs in them. We really need a better rules system. 	It is unclear if the agent_2 likes or dislikes health. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['health', 'sports', 'baseball'].
5222	agent_1:Hello,  do you like baseball? agent_2:Hey I do like baseball! Did you know that managers can actually play baseball? that's why they wear the uniforms, just in case the need arises, then they can play for the team agent_1:Yeah I did,  thats pretty awesome.  Hopefully they dont have to though,  most of them are a bit older.  Theres like 20 players on a team though,  shouldnt have the need.  agent_2:No I agree with you. Have you ever played kickball when you were in school? Apparently in Canada, it's not called kickball, it's called soccer baseball LOL agent_1:I did, used to love kickball,  I feel like kickball is a more appropriate name for it,  what does soccer mean? agent_2:I know right! I definitely think that kickball is the right word. It's the best way to describe it, what would you do if you found millions of dollars of baseball cards in your attic by the way? agent_1:Wow well pay off my car and cc's,  go on a small vacation and put the rest in savings or investments,  then continue my life.  how about you? agent_2:Haha I would do something similar. Definitely pay off my student loans and everything. And probably retire LOL. I can't believe that some guy found 3 million dollars worth of those cards in his grandfather's attic though. What a lucky guy agent_1:I know thats amazing.  That would be really nice,  my relatives dont collect anything cool like that so Im on my own lol  agent_2:Haha yes that's too bad, mine did not either. Have you ever been to Japan by the way? Apparently baseball is really huge over there	agent_1:I have a trip planned for next jan to Japan!  No I had no idea that baseball was big there,  maybe I can catch a game!	agent_2 likes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'personal', 'vacation'].
7154	agent_1:hi how are you? do you like to dance? agent_2:I like to watch it. I know Bruce Lee was a great dancer and he won the Hong Kong Cha Cha Championship in 1958. agent_1:i cant say that im surprised. he must have had a great sense of rhythm. i bet he was a real ladies' man. agent_2:Yeah, I bet. Did you know ballet dancers can go through four pairs of pointe shoes in a week. agent_1:if i were a dancer, i would go through a dozen. LOL. i cannot dance. really. agent_2:Me too! Did you know Michael Jackson has a patent? agent_1:is that the patent on the shoes for that special lean? he really was a genius. agent_2:It was a device used to achieve the extreme lean in some of his dance moves. agent_1:yeah, thats it! i was never any good at dancing. i wonder if you have to start when youre young. agent_2:Well, I know babies spontaneously dance when they hear music. Maybe the better dancers heard a lot of music when they were younger. agent_1:i wonder if i heard enough music. maybe that was it. maybe i missed by window. oh well. agent_2:Yeah, maybe. I know they smile more when they hit the bet. agent_1:I use smile when i hit a bet too. LOL i heard that tupac was a dancer back in high school. agent_2:Yeah, I think he danced in the Nutcracker in HS. agent_1:I bet he was really good too. he was a backup dancer for digital underground later on. by the way, are you a fan of snakes? agent_2:No. I'm not crazy about snakes. There's no snakes in New Zealand. agent_1:so ive heard. i guess i would move there if i had a phobia of snakes. i have never seen a flying snake. that would be frightening.	agent_2:No, basically they;re legless lizards without limbs.	agent_1 likes animals. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['animals', 'dance', 'no'].

Did you know astronauts can vote from space? agent_2:I didn't know, that' cool. I know that a chimpanzee received 400,000 votes in Rio de Janeiro in 1988.  agent_1:Haha He would have my vote too! I didn't know not all men in the uk could vote until 1918! agent_2:haha mine too. Do you that all votes in Canada are equal to all the votes in California minus 50 votes. agent_1:I believe it!

What about you? agent_1:oh ya I love stranger things and other shows they have, I do the digital though not with dvds agent_2:Oh no I don't do DVDs either just the streaming service.  It's too bad it doesn't have Game of Thrones though, that show has gotten 37 emmy awards. agent_1:I do like GOT! George RR Martin is the author and a genius! agent_2:It is such a hit parents are naming their kids Arya.  Only a couple more months until the last season starts. agent_1:ya I can't wait, weird that charlie Chaplins granddaughter is in the show too! agent_2:Wonder if they ever offered Tom Cruise a part, he has won so many awards for best actor, they probably can't afford him. agent_1:ya, he is a great actor though, so many classic roles like Maverick in Top gun and Ron Kovic in Born on the Fourth of July agent_2:Yeah I really like him in The Last Samurai.  He spend time learning Japanese and swordplay on this own to prepare for the role.  Good on him. agent_1:yup I like that movie, I never realized samurai was plural and refers to the whole group and not just Tom Cruise haha agent_2:I liked him in Rainman too, that movie won Best Picture.  I think one of my favorites is when he plays a hitman in Collateral with Jamie Foxx.	agent_1:oh ya that is a really good movie, he is kind of looney though he spent 10 million dollars to build a bunker to protect himself from aliens	agent_2 likes movie. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'movie genre', 'samurai'].

How about you? agent_1:I love Google, i can't stand other search engines like bing or yahoo agent_2:I refuse to use Bing because I despise Microsoft even more than Google.  agent_1:lol, Google is incredible though, it requires more computing power for one search than it took to send neil armstrong to the moon! agent_2:Yeah, pretty much any kind of personal electronic device these days would put the supercomputers of that period to shame. agent_1:that is very true, a lot has come since back then. How about siri, are you a fan? agent_2:I don't even have a smart phone, so I've never used it. Have you? agent_1:wow, you are daring, i like it! I have an iphone but never use siri, I would rather just google something instead to be honest. agent_2:I'm not really daring, LOL. I just live in a 3G dead zone and I'm self-employed, so I just need a basic tracfone in case I have an emergency on my occasional trips to town. But my laptop is all the Internet connection I need.	agent_1:I have a friend like that also, no shame in that.

I'm glad baseball season is about to start back up! agent_1:Did you know there is a golf course in Dubai that requires 4 million gallons of water a day? Seems like such a needless waste. agent_2:No I didn't but I totally agree with you.  I guess Dubai is in a desert region so they need a lot of water to keep the grass green but it still seems wrong just to play golf on it. agent_1:Even the ones in the US only use 312k gallons a day, which is no small amount, but is much less than that one single course. agent_2:Isn't Dubai mostly for the wealthy?  That could explain the excess. agent_1:It actually is not even as wealthy as New York or London. It is only marketed to seem very wealthy when in reality it isn't all that much. Abu Dhabi is actually the most wealthy city in the world. agent_2:I didn't know that! I always thought it was Dubai. It looks like I've believed the hype.  Speaking of hype, did you know that Babe Ruth was one our most famous golfers? agent_1:He must have been much better than Micheal Jordan haha. Did you know Samuel L Jackson puts a golf clause in his contracts that allows him to play golf twice a week during production of a movie?

12911	agent_1:Good morning.  So, the other day I was shopping for a shirt and then I heard that originally shirts used to be an item worn exclusively by men.  How strange. agent_2:Maybe because women only wore dresses? agent_1:Maybe, that would make sense.  In America we will call most anything a shirt, but in British English it is specifically what we would refer to as a dress shirt.  That could be confusing if you are visiting another country. agent_2:Oh, so that is probably what they meant-women did not used to wear dress shirts. agent_1:Maybe.  I am glad I don't work somewhere I have to wear dress shirts or button up shirts.  There are also button down shirts, which is where the collar also has buttons. agent_2:If you're in Hawaii, the official business attire is the aloha shirt. That seems fun. agent_1:Which is why I love Hawaii so much.  Aloha shirts are great.   agent_2:In China gangs used to layer on as many shirts as possible. That seems, um, uncomfortable. agent_1:Yeah, and they used to pop the collars.  I remember when popping your polo shirt collar was a fashion around here. agent_2:It's interesting that polo shirts were invented for one specific tennis player. agent_1:Yeah, the ones with the crocodile on them. agent_2:It's interesting that they got named polo shirts since polo players didn't adopt them until later. agent_1:It's funny how clothing gets certain names. agent_2:Yes, it is. I like to wear polos when I go out. I think they are fancy enough for a night out. I'd like to attend a monthly music fest that occurs at Gee's club. agent_1:Oh yeah?  I have heard about that place.  What kind of music is played there? agent_2:They play oldies. Since about a year and a half ago since the death of Royal Torrence, it's been a monthly affair.  agent_1:That sounds like a lot of fun.  I heard they have a lot of different musicians that play there. agent_2:Yeah, it is pretty popular. It's only a $5 donation.	agent_1:Oh wow, that's neat that it is a donation and not a mandatory cover.  I am sure a lot of people go there to drink and dance and listen to all kinds of music.	agent_2 likes music. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'hobby', 'fashion'].
4998	agent_1:How's it going, do you follow baseball? The Nationals recently traded Daniel Murphy and Matt Adams to the Cubs agent_2:I don't follow baseball much, but I do think I heard something recently in the news about how the Cubs won over the Phillies? It's so confusing when they trade players for me to follow! agent_1:Yea, I guess the manager Martinez isn't doing too good in Washington and traded them away agent_2:I think the Cubs have been having a lot of trouble with their player's health. I hope they can turn it around and have a good season! agent_1:Maybe, but the Cubs haven't been too lucky since they started in 1903 agent_2:I think I've heard about that...are they the team that one back to back and then haven't won another World Series since then? agent_1:The Cubs didn't win until 2016, they beat the Royals I believe  agent_2:Oops meant won not one. I remember a long time ago they lost in a famous World Series game to the White Sox. I'm glad they won recently, as it's been a long time! agent_1:Yea, When the Cubs won 5 million people celebrated in the street, they have been waiting a long time agent_2:I bet that was one of the best baseball celebrations ever! I heard that Ronald Regan was a broadcaster for the Cubs in the thirties. He had a very interesting life! agent_1:Yea, wonder if he called the infamous Billy Goat game agent_2:How do you play that? I heard that when the Cubs first started playing baseball they were the Chicago Orphans. I wonder what the story behind that is, though? agent_1:I don't know, the Cubs were founded the same year as the Battle of Little Bighorn so maybe it has something to do with the times	agent_2:That's a fun fact! I also hear they're called the North Siders because of where Wrigley Field is and The White Sox has their field on the South Side of Chicago.

I heard the main focus was creativity agent_1:I sure can, so 4 American orchestras are playing on the festival, the music is great and presenters a re good as well, all the orchestras are famous and skilled so I can see why the main focus is creativity agent_2:Who were some of the present artists? agent_1:National Symphony Orchestra, Albanys Symphony, Fort Worths Symphony and theres even dancers from the texas ballet agent_2:That sounds like quite the lineup. Do you enjoy going to such events like concerts? agent_1:It does sound like an interesting lineup, worth every penny, and yeah I like concerts agent_2:Any in particular you want to or wished you went to? agent_1:I regret not going to a Linking Park concert, that is one of my favorite bands, they performed 324 concerts in 2001 and I couldnt make it agent_2:That is a lot of concerts in one year. I wanted to go hear the ramones who toured almost 20 years nonstop with over 2000 concerts under their belt agent_1:Thats a lot of concerts as well, they must have spent all their time touring, travelling around the world. agent_2:Ya. Personally as long as it's not a creed concert or heavy metal, I think I would enjoy it	agent_1:Yeah I heard Creed had a terrible concert back in 2002, they even got sued because of their poor performance	agent_2 likes music. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'travel', 'festivals'].

Long-time Yankee fan over here. agent_2:You probably won't like this but I'm Red Sox fan. I heard that Eric Hosmer signed with the San Diego Padres  for $144 million in an eight year contract. agent_1:Haha you're right I don't like the Red Sox. Yes I believe the Hosmer contract was last year. I think that's going to end up being a bad contract. agent_2:Me too. I think its too much money for a player that has proven himself. He is a 28 years old and he plays in the first base position and he did very well as a Royal. agent_1:By the end of that deal he will be in his mid to late 30's and nowhere ear as good. Definitely an overpay. Not as crazy as those Machado and Harper deals for over 300 million though. agent_2:No nothing like that. He has won 4 Gold Gloves in his career and I will like to see him in a Red Sox uniform. agent_1:That's true the Red Sox only weakness now is 1st base. Who's their starting, Mitch Moreland? agent_2:You are correct. I also heard that Hosmer will be making $20 million over each of the first 5 seasons with the Padres.	agent_1:That's smart to front load it. It's crazy how much these guys get to play baseball.

Do you know how much the first ever Amazon purchase was for? agent_2:No I don't know, do you have any idea, if yes how much was the first purchase? agent_1:Yeah it was for $27.95 and it was for the rights to name a building after themselves.  agent_2:Wow, I will always respect Amazon, because they offer thousandth of people employment rather or not they except it. agent_1:Yeah they do, do you know that the US postal service has a contract with Amazon to deliver on Sundays? agent_2:No I didn't know that, but I notice they Improve their delivery services to only a few days before receiving their packages. agent_1:Yeah they do.  On a different note, do you know much about sharks?	agent_2:No, I don't, but I know there are different kind of sharks and they behave in different ways.

I do like their shows though agent_1:Netflix tv shows are awesome. And Netflix founder was reed hastings and marc. agent_2:Yep he started it because he was mad about the late fee for his movie Apollo 13 haha that is actually really good movie have you ever seen it agent_1:I saw that movie. I think the movie was released in 1970. agent_2:I think it was actually in the nineties I think you're thinking of the wrong one haha. Apollo 13 head Tom Hanks in it. What do you think about Tom Cruise though agent_1:I love tom cruise and his movies. It was awesome. mission impossible movie was so great. agent_2:Yep I like Mission Impossible II. I also like The Color of Money in the movie Cocktail. Eyes Wide Shut was pretty weird though haha agent_1:tom cruise edge of tomorrow movie was awesome. edge of tomorrow directer has a great mind. agent_2:It's crazy that Tom Cruise spent two years learning Japanese and how to use a samurai sword to prepare for the movie The Last Samurai. Personally I didn't really like that movie what did you think agent_1:Tom cruise was great actor and hard worker. He spend a lot of to learn a japanese language. agent_2:Yeah for sure.

What did you think of the article? agent_2:Not exactly one I've ever thought about for sure. agent_1:I figured we could just start by looking at the first section here. I found it really interesting about using robots to prepare Mars for human arrival. agent_2:I'd feel a lot better in a way sending robots up first to test things. But, what robots do not have are human emotions that would have to deal with such a bizarre plan. agent_1:Sorry for the delay. I was reading ahead and got distracted. I totally agree with you on that. The idea that we may only be 20 to 25 years away is crazy to me.	agent_2:I just really don't see the point from what I've read here. Why travel so far to go to somewhere that has nothing to offer a human? Can't you just move to a different destination right here on Earth? Seems an awful lot to go through just to get away...no?	agent_1 dislikes travel. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['travel', 'technology', 'future technology'].

3880	agent_1:Hello, did you know the dodo bird is actual a sub-family of the pigeon. agent_2:I didn't know that- of course I believe the bird is extinct, isn't it?  This year we recently had a bunch of hummingbirds..that was a first for me and so exciting. SO TINY.. agent_1:I also find it interesting that some birds can fly from alaska to north america without sleeping when they migrate. agent_2:Birds are very interesting because of a lot of facts.  I think it helps with their flight that their bones are hollow so not weighed down.  agent_1:Yes, they are interesting. I did not know that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. I find that very interersting. agent_2:I have watched them pull some to make them nearby.  The way they flit about is so beautiful to watch.  It is almost elegant like a dance. ..performing art! agent_1:Yes, did you know that Jackie Chan manages a k-pop band. I did not know that but i think it's cool. agent_2:It seems that so many you wouldn't think to have other interests do.  Jackie in music, Bruce Lee in dancing.  A championship even! agent_1:It seems to be in a kpop band you have to be tough because they go through bootcamps before being signed. agent_2:Boot camps for bands.. Guess it takes a lot of stamina for the dancing and singing.  Kind of the same I would assume for figure skating.  Can you imagine the work to land a triple axel? agent_1:That is true. It looks hard. Did you know babies spontaneously dance when they hear music. They are cute. agent_2:Music is a wonderful thing, so much to come out of it.  Symbiotic relationship with dance and music. Tupac was able to do both- never would have thought ballet for him though. agent_1:Yes, that definitely does not fit his image. I was surprised that ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week. That is a lot. agent_2:The tip starts to break down and doesn't hold form.  Same with skates, have to keep them sharp or can't get the edge for spins and jumps. Would have to assume that Nagasu goes through a lot of skates for this reason. agent_1:I like that she wanted to do the triple axel so bad that she dreamed she could . That shows heart for wanting to do something. agent_2:Especially when she had been passed over for the previous Olympics.  Rippon omitted his quad jump at the start, not as much heart I guess. agent_1:And she is part of the record books for being the first U.S. lady to land triple axel in olympic competition. agent_2:She had her wish of making America proud.  Guess the same can't be said for the Russians because of the prior doping scandal. agent_1:Yes, the doping scandal can be hard to come back from. It is amazing the amount of doping in sports today. agent_2:You would think that rather than compromising, like the Olympic committee did, they would just start to ban them.  Isn't teaching them anything to allow certain numbers to still participate and medal. agent_1:That's true. Did you know Michael Jackson had a patent on his leaning dance move. agent_2:I didn't know that there was a device involved in it.  Wonder with his death if the patent transferred to someone? agent_1:Maybe it got passed down to his children. agent_2:He certainly was talented.  Wonder if he did his own choreography? agent_1:I think he did. He worked too hard and I think that is what caused his death. He had his whole family to take care of really. agent_2:So much control.  At least after he left Jackson 5 he had some freedom unlike the kids in K pop. Agencies controlling everything. Yikes! agent_1:That is true and to think K-pop had it's first group of women in the 60's is surprising. I thought k-pop was pretty new. agent_2:I was vaguely familiar with H.O.T. , Korean version of Backstreet Boys. Social networking and YouTube have launched a lot of the Korean Wave. agent_1:Yes and they have the loudest and most loyal fans.	agent_2:I wonder if because they are now going global with this music if you will start to see fusion music.

In 1998, serena and venus williams said they could beat any man ranked 200 or worse in a game of tennis. they lost when challenged twice lol agent_2:lol, well she did win the australian open when she was ranked 95th agent_1:i have heard Serena williams is a co-owner of the miami dolphins agent_2:I didn't know that, she speaks french and italian so I wonder if she owns any sports teams in Europe agent_1:not sure but In january 2007, serena williams was ranked 95th in the world in tennis agent_2:I never knew she was ever ranked that low"	agent_1:well she reached the No. 1 ranking for the first time on July 8, 2002 but has since fallen	agent_2 likes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'basketball', 'tennis player'].

Hard to believe amazon workers walk between 7 and 15 miles each day. agent_1:Yeah I use it quite a bit myself, and it is hard to believe, I would think no more than 2 or 3.  agent_2:Yea that seems more accurate. Also I was interested to know IMDB is owned by Amazon.  agent_1:Yeah I didn't know that about them, I wonder how many other things they own? agent_2:Yeah good question. I respect Bezos though. He built the largest internet retailer in the world all the way back in 1994. agent_1:Yeah Bezos is a great businessman.  Did you know he built a clock into a mountain that will run for 10,000 years? agent_2:Whoa I would like to see that. The Amazon contract with USPS must explain how they are able to deliver packages so fast, even on Sundays! agent_1:Yeah I wonder how the postal employees felt when they learned that Sundays are no longer off days for all. 	agent_2:Yeah I bet that didn't go over so well.

We just watched Empire of the Sun, it had a very young Christian Bale in it! agent_2:I like the jurassic park movies a lot. Me and my son like watching stff like that he loves dinosars. agent_1:My son too, he keeps telling me when the new Jurassic movies are coming out, 2020 apparently. agent_2:Thats awesome. I hadnt heard abot a new one. Fnny thing about Speilberg. When he rode the jurassic park ride he asked to be let off before the 84 foot drop. I can nderstand what he is going through there thogh. Im not a big rollercoaster fan. agent_1:Same here.  My son loves Cedar Point in Ohio, we take him and he goes on all the big rides while I sit and watch.  I guess everyone seeks their own entertainment. agent_2:Yeah I went on a roller coaster when i was little that did a flip. Then it went backwards and did the flip again. I have hated them ever sense.  agent_1:I think I'll stick to the movies.  Have you ever seen the movie Moon?  It's about ten years old now, it was made by David Bowie's son Duncan Jones. agent_2:No I havent seen it is it good. agent_1:It's interesting in a small movie way.  Clever story with a nice twist at the end.   agent_2:Ill have to check it out. One of the earliest movies I an remember seeing is ET. My mom liked it when I was a kid.  agent_1:I remember that one when I was at school, I had to wait until it was on VHS.  I also recall be scared by Close Encounters, it took me nearly ten years to watch it. agent_2:I wasnt one for scary movies either. My sister loved them even when she was a little kid. Did yo ever see Schindlers list.We watched that one in school.  agent_1:Yes, I remember going with my dad.  It almost felt like we had to go.  It's amazing how a movie maker can go from big popcorn movies like E.T. to a serious movie such as Schindler's List. agent_2:Yeah that movie was deep. I took an elective class in high school on the holocaust and we watched it. That was a screwed up time in history. Man the way they lined p the Jews and shot them in rows to save bullets. That always sticks out to me as a prime example of how sick and screwed up the Germans were at that time. Not worried about the lives they took at all just how many bullets they used doing it. agent_1:I know, it affected me a lot at the time.  I'd also recently been to Germany and seen one of those concentration camps.  I don't know how people can become like that. agent_2:I also remember the goonies. That ones a classic in my book. Speilberg flew the entire cast to Hawaii after they were done shootiIng Man they have made some money off that movie. 	agent_1:We just showed that one to the kids.

844	agent_1:Hi and good afternoon. Are you a poetry fan? It has a long history dating back to prehistoric times. agent_2:Hi, how are you? i am not a big fan of poetry. Are you? agent_1:I think it's fun to read sometimes. The origins are more interesting for me. Early poems in the Eurasian content evolved from folksongs.  agent_2:I dont much about poetry. that is interesting. i guess poetry and songs would be closely related. agent_1:Yes I suppose they would. They tried to define poetry in ancient Greece such as Aristotle's poetics. It focused on the use of speech in rhetoric, drama, song, and comedy. agent_2:I guess poetry is spoken and written, so it is related to many arts. Do you have a favorite poet? agent_1:I think it's funny when comedians do poetry. I don't really have a favorite poet. Demetri Martin wrote a 224 word palindrome! agent_2:that must have taken him quite a while. 224 words, backwards and forwards? my head hurts. agent_1:Yes mine hurts just thinking about it. Edgar Allan Poe is another classic poet and he only received $9 for the publication of his poem the Raven. agent_2:He probably spent it on drugs and booze too. the man was so decadent, but maybe it inspired him. agent_1:Yeah you probably did. I love the hobbit too. Most of the character names were taken out of an old Icelandic poem called dvergatal. agent_2:Yes, Tolkien loved old languages. he studied them and learned to speak some of them.  agent_1:That is so fascinating, I love his works of fiction. I like fiction because it is so imaginative. What is your favorite genre? agent_2:I like non fiction because i want to keep up with what is going on in the world.  agent_1:That's good and definitely practical. The author of game of thrones despises fan fiction because he says it is copyright infringement and not a good exercise for aspiring writers. I kind of see where he's coming from. agent_2:the fans should try to write their own stories, not rehash someone else's.  agent_1:Exactly. I think it's so funny authors used have to write on old typewriters. Now they have computers which can basically carry out any sequence of arithmetic or logical operations.	agent_2:Yes, the typewriter changes the relationship between the writer and the prose. i figure that the computer makes my writing different.	agent_1 likes technology. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['technology', 'entertainment', 'book'].

They're the most numerically successful class of tetrapods. agent_1:Ah I gotcha, I was going to say there are some tips to maximize space in the oven during Thanksgiving, but that might just bore both of us haha. That's pretty cool about chickens, there are over 10000 birds that classify as tetrapods. agent_2:I'm sure that some like hummingbirds don't lend themselves to eating, but I know that ostrich steaks are a thing; I wonder how to cook those! I guess they can be so big because they don't fly. agent_1:True, I'm surprised they still have wings. I cannot believe how small hummingbirds are, only 2 inches!	agent_2:I guess they're still evolving to the point where the wings disappear.

Maryland's governor, Larry Hogan, is a republican who was under some hot water for policies on climate change. agent_2:Thats interesting.  the beatles song""come together"" was written for 1969 governor campaign. agent_1:Larry Hogan could probably have used the support of a group like the Beatles, but I'm sure he will be ok.  At least he isn't as bad as North Dakota's in 1934 who actually seceded from the US for a short time! agent_2:when schwarzenegger became governor of ca he commuted 3 hours everyday lol  agent_1:Maybe so he could leave the office every day and say ""I'll be back!""   agent_2:haha good one!    agent_1:Did you hear that Texas had a female governor before other states even allowed women to vote? agent_2:Yeah thats really interesting. did you know there hasnt been a us president who wasnt a rep or dem since 1853?"	agent_1:Wow!

It's a real shame how much water is wasted per day on each course, though. It's over 300,000 gallons a day a course! agent_2:True, but consider that golf courses in America combined are larger than the size of two small US states! agent_1:Yeah, golf must be pretty popular in that case. Did you know there exists a golf course in Dubai that uses around 4 million gallons a day? That must cost a lot of money. agent_2:I suppose that comes with games that cannot and do not utilize a standardized playing area agent_1:You know what games do utilize a standardized playing area? Baseball and softball. The fields are pretty similar. agent_2:Interesting.    Babe Ruth was both a famous golfer and baseball player! agent_1:Speaking of famous people who play sports, Samuel L. Jackson actually plays golf twice a week during filming of whatever he's in. agent_2:Cool.    Did you know Jose canseco claims to hold the record for longest softball homerun at 622 feet agent_1:Woah, that's really far! Softball players don't make a lot of money. It's usually between $5,000 and $6,000. agent_2:Well, what do you expect with a game invented at the YMCA? agent_1:Softball may have been invented at the YMCA, but it's pretty much a lesser baseball, which is America's national pastime. 	agent_2:Someone asked me about points in baseball, and I had to explain they are runs!	agent_1 likes sports. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'hobby', 'favorite sport'].

Listening to them might be better than going to a Creed concert.  Some dissatisfied listeners once filed a lawsuit since a performance was so bad. agent_2:I don't blame them. The foo fighters once did a concert so loud it was recorded on New Zealand's seismic monitors agent_1:Wow, that is loud!  But I'll bet it was fun.

Those classic acts had it going on.

I wonder what they'd do if that got the most checks. agent_2:i wonder, and what if all the states had that option? agent_1:The lawyers would have a field day, remember all that fuss in 2000 with the hanging chads.  If every State had none of the above win it would be chaos. agent_2:definitely, funny fact, the taller presidential candidate has one 75% of the time since 1900 agent_1:I'm six four, maybe I missed my calling, I could have been president.

It's crazy that baseball managers can actually join in the game, that's why they wear uniforms agent_2:Yes, if they need to play for their teams, I dont know why that would happen, but it might be fun to watch! agent_1:Yeah that could be cool. It's also cool that a man found millions of dollars worth of old baseball cards in his attic haha his grandfather and put them there and I guess forgotten about them? agent_2:Maybe, I should start checking my attic and see what treasures are stored up there.  I might have an early retirement.   agent_1:Haha yes I hope so! You know what is weird though? Have you ever played the game kickball, apparently it's called soccer-baseball in Canada for some reason agent_2:I guess it is a pretty accurate name too, however I much prefer kickball. agent_1:Uranium kickball sounds a lot better haha. What do you think about the Japanese? Apparently they are shocked to learn that baseball is actually America's pastime and was not invented in Japan agent_2:It is surprising, I bet they wonder why they are not invited to the world series either. agent_1:Haha yes I bet!

Especially when it comes to world cups. agent_1:Yeah I don't really like either game haha. It is crazy though that the World Series actually started back in 1903, so I do respect its long history. agent_2:The cubs won the first back to back series and then didnt win again until 2016.

Did they want others to play it? How did they put it there? agent_1:I have no idea how it got there, that is a big mystery can you imagine reaching the top and theres a piano right there agent_2:A mystery, like the  mysterious mute man  found wandering the streets in England in 2005 and could only communicate via piano agent_1:I didnt hear about that mute man, sounds like an interesting anecdote agent_2:Almost as strange as Richard Nixon's piano concerto, which he wrote and performed it live on the Tonight Show agent_1:He did? I dint know he played the piano what other instruments do you like maybe the guitar? agent_2:The guitar is totally rad man. I dig it. Since its debut in 1949, the Les Paul Gibson es-175 guitar has never gone out of production. agent_1:I like Eddie Van Halen I heard the studio got on fire with one of his solos, so much power in that guitar agent_2:He really can shred. Setting the amp on fire! Great! Brian May of Queen built his guitar out of parts from an old fireplace and his mother's knitting needle.  agent_1:How the level of skill and the determination to become a guitarist, he also has a PHD in astrophysics, really intelligent man agent_2:True. Cornell university researchers built the world's smallest guitar,played by a laser, about the size of a red blood cell.

7713	"agent_1:Hi, how are you? agent_2:Great, how are you? agent_1:I am well. Do you believe in aliens? agent_2:The one's from space? Not likely to have happened, though there is life on other planets. What about you? agent_1:Not really. I am not even remotely interested in space so I usually ignore that stuff. X-files on the other hand... agent_2:The aliens missed their colonization date. Why so close to Christmas? I guess the winter solstice is a good date. agent_1:What a bunch of downers. At least we have will smith to protect us! agent_2:Did you know that over 80 percent of the Earth's forests have already been destroyed? Maybe the aliens will be appalled at the destruction and leave. agent_1:Or our level of stupidity and move on so we don't ruin their planet.  agent_2:In September 2010, the UN appointed an ambassador to extraterrestrials in case they make contact with us. I wonder how you quality for THAT job. Seems like there would be little to do. agent_1:Yeah. I am not sure that's a full-time job. ""Any aliens today?"" ""No."" ""See you tomorrow!"" agent_2:There seems to be more pressing problems. Earth will be helium-free by the end of the 21st century. Where will we get helium for our balloons? Maybe the aliens will bring some for us.  agent_1:Can helium be created in a lab? On a personal note, I have two helium balloons stuck in my vaulted ceiling. That helium lasts for at least 3 weeks. It is getting tiresome.] agent_2:In 2007 Tom Cruise spent millions on an underground bunker to protect himself from aliens. Maybe he knows some of the firefighters trained in treating aliens, in the event of a UFO crash. Or maybe he has a secret helium source. agent_1:As long as he is not jumping on the couches in his bunker, I am fine with it. He seems a little weird..."	agent_2:Speaking of weird, the world's longest name is a story about a shepherd protecting his sheep and humanity from aliens. Who has this name, and why?

5417	agent_1:Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You ! ;) agent_2:Thanks! Do you follow baseball?  Did you know that managers can actually play for their team if needed so that is why they suit up? agent_1:I heard something like that, but I wonder how often was that actually implemented in the game. Did You ever see something like that ? agent_2:I never saw that.  But I've played kickball.  Did you know that kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada? agent_1:soccer-baseball ;) that's a first... is even kick ball popular in Canada ? Do You know ? agent_2:I don't know for sure.  But baseball is really popular in Japan and fans are surprised to discover its status as America's national pastime agent_1:In Japan ? Are You sure ? I didn't know Japan played baseball. Did you ? agent_2:Yes! They play well at the Little League World Series.  Did you know that Babe Ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 and lose the '26 world series with his team only down by one run agent_1:yeah, Mr. Ruth was quite a legend... have You watched games with him ? Pretty exciting thing to see... agent_2:I've seen movies.  In the 1992 World Series, the U.S. Marine corps color guard carried the canada flag into the stadium upside down agent_1:wow... that was the last time he did that probably... I hope it was not intentional... ;) agent_2:The Chicago Cubs were the first baseball team to win back-to-back world series and haven't won since agent_1:wow, this must suck for them and their managers ;) such high expectations every year probably and then bum... back to square one... agent_2:The Cubs have had pitchers with a varying number of fingers including 4,5 and 6.  Do you know any of those pitchers? agent_1:sorry I don't, do you ? agent_2:No not sure, but one team had a one-handed pitched who did an amazing job named Jim Abbott agent_1:not bad... I'm sure that one hand was insured for a lot of money ;) agent_2:The Braves hadn't been in the playoffs for a while but made it this year. agent_1:Good for them, were You cheering for them ? agent_2:No way.  How about you? agent_1:Naah, me neither ;) I don't care much for that sport - sorry, I'm from Europe, we have different interests I guess...  agent_2:Nice talking.  If you find old major league baseball cards, they could be worth millions.

7669	"agent_1:Earth is the third planet from the sun and it is the only planet to have water in liquid form. agent_2:Yeah and Earth's surface is covered by about 71% water, mostly oceans. agent_1:Only 3% water is fresh water which is used for drinking. Earth has one natural satellite is Moon. The earth receives its light and heat from the sun. agent_2:Yeah and scientists say that earth will be virtually helium free by the end of the 21st century1 Crazy! agent_1:The earth spins on its own axis it causes for the day and night changes. If day in one part of the earth may be other part of earth have night. agent_2:Earth's axis is tilted with respect to it's orbital plane, producing seasons. Thank goodness for seasons. My favorite is Spring! agent_1:The layer of the lithosphere is the upper most layer. Almost 71% of earth surface is covered with water remaining 29% is of water. The polar region are covered with snow or ice. agent_2:Hm. The planet Uranus actually rotates sideways and ""rolls"" around the sun rather than ""spinning"" like other planets! agent_1:Very interesting. Already 80% of forest area in the world has been destroyed which results in global warming and climate changes and affects the green houses of the environment. Lot of pollution also. agent_2:Yeah, sadly mostly human activities are to blame for that, including massive deforestation for many reasons.  agent_1:Planet is a term that has been used since ancient times in the context of history, astrology, science, mythology and religion. There are five planets visible to naked eyes in the solar system. agent_2:Yep, I've seen all of the naked eye planets. Have you? agent_1:Yes, Venus rises before the sun, so early that it is called the morning star. agent_2:Ah yes! Have you ever seen Jupiter or Saturn with just your eyes? agent_1:It is small planet we can see them with the help of telescope.

7862	agent_1:Hey do you like baseball by the way? What do you think about the Nationals agent_2:I'm a big baseball fan!  I think they will do ok even though they lost Bryce Harper.  It's kind of the same situation like how they lost Jayson Werth a few years ago. agent_1:Speaking of baseball did you know that a baseball manager can actually play for the team if necessary? agent_2:That would be interesting to see!  That's one rule I didn't know. agent_1:Yep that's why they wear uniforms, also weird is that in Canada people is known as soccer baseball agent_2:That's interesting too!  Up until 2005 a married couple scheduled all 2430 MLB games for 24 years. agent_1:That seems like a lot of work! Do you know why they stopped? The guy who found millions of dollars of baseball cards in his attic is a very lucky dude! agent_2:I don't know why they stopped.  I know I would stop working if I found a million dollars worth of baseball cards!  lol agent_1:Yep I could think of a lot of things to do with a million dollars lOL and I would be very happy that my grandfather had them in the Attic agent_2:Yes!  No doubt.  Did you know that the womens world cup had a higher tv ratings than the world series in the US? agent_1:No I didn't know that that's crazy. also crazy is that baseball is super popular in Japan, they even think that it is their National Pastime and not ours LOL agent_2:lol  Babe Ruth who was known for home runs was caught stealing to end game 7 of the 1926 world series?  Interesting useless stat.  lol agent_1:Haha what's an interesting stat. Do you ever watch Game of Thrones? I know that's a change of topic agent_2:I've seen it but don't follow it close.  I know it got financed by Ireland because they film scenes there which boosts tourism incomes. agent_1:Yep you're right about that. I think it first premiered back in 2011 which seems like a long time ago, I can't wait for the new season to start in April agent_2:The next season is supposed to be the last one correct?	agent_1:Yes it will be the last one.

13030	agent_1:Do you like bird? maybe have birdwatching as one of your hobbies? agent_2:I like birds but I'm not an official birdwatcher.  I am a bit surprised to learn that the dodo bird is a real thing.  The are actually part of the pidgeon family.  agent_1:They are? I thought dodo birds were ficticious or extinct at least, you know that some birds travel really long distances without a rest agent_2:So did I.  Did you know that hummingbirds are known to take spiderwebs to use on their nests?  Little thieves...  agent_1:They do? I guess spiders must be angry at them then lol, you know that most birds have bones that are so hollow that their skeleton weights even less than their feather!! agent_2:Yeah, I bet there are a lot of bird-hating spiders.  I did know that but the wild birds of Australia have an added talent: they can mimic the sounds of stuff like car alarms and chainsaws.  agent_1:That must be interesting, I would love to hear a bird that sounds like a chainsaw lol, that bird has some identity issues for sure. agent_2:Yep, some bird therapy is in order.  FYI: I grew up on a ranch.  We had many horses but I didn't know one could be allergic to them.  Clint Eastwood is.  agent_1:He is? thats weird considered he has done many movies that involved horses and him riding them, agent_2:Yeah, an occupational hazard for sure... I didn't know that firefighters used dalmations to calm horses.  Most of our horses didn't really care for dogs.  agent_1:Thats an interesting fact did you also hear the story about the two kids that got suspended because they showed up riding horses to school? agent_2:Yeah, my dad used to ride horses to school in west Texas.  Man, horses go way back to 4000 BCE.  I wonder how they know that...	agent_1:Yeah right? it seems like a difficult string of data to know, Icelandic horses must be really fast,	agent_2 likes hobby. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobby', 'horses', 'hobby'].

I wish I could. agent_1:I do not dance either. i am terrible. i might hurt people in the vicinity. i would hurt their feelings. agent_2:Do you know who Bruce Lee was? agent_1:I do! he was a great martial artist that wowed american audiences with his prowess. agent_2:He was also a great dancer.  He won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship in 1958. agent_1:I guess he had a tremendous sense of rhythm too. I would love to see footage of him dancing. agent_2:It was before youtube.  Probably, you cannot find it online. agent_1:Yeah, that is too bad. he was probably a real ladies man too. Tupac was also a great dancer. agent_2:A ballet dancer!  He was the mouse king in his high school production of the Nutcracker. agent_1:I would love to see video of that too. he was a backup dancer for digital underground too. agent_2:That was interesting.  If I were not self conscious, I might be able to dance just like what babies do when they hear music. agent_1:I probably could not dance as a baby even.

Rock music, pop music, country, I like it all. 	agent_2:That's pretty cool.

2665	agent_1:Where do you source your news? Fox, Cnn, other? agent_2:Mostly other. Certainly not Fox.  agent_1:Did you know that CNN recently raised concern about Fox & Friends? agent_2:I had heard something about it. Weren't they concerned about their interviews with Republicans? agent_1:Yes you are correct. Despite the students mourning due to a mass shooting a day earlier, Republicans appeared only a fox where they wouldn't be pressed about gun control agent_2:That's terrible. All of our press should be able to question our representatives. I think some of the people they interviewed were Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz if I remember correctly.  agent_1:All they mentioned was that it was a truly heart breaking horror and that evil is sadly always present. agent_2:We should have known it's bias since it was created by a Republican media strategist and Richard Nixon.  agent_1:I feel that most news are bias in some way or another. Too bad fox is watched more than cnn and msnbc combined. agent_2:That's sad. Apparently they even threatened to sue the Simpsons for making fun of them for their anti-democratic agenda. They wanted to stop them from continuing that.  agent_1:I mean usually its kind of funny how they threatened to sue the Simpsons over a fact which is true. I guess their perspective is a given since they were created by Richard ailes and president Richard nixon. agent_2:I agree. They would never win because of parody laws anyway. Did you know that every US president with a beard has been a Republican?! How odd.  agent_1:It seems like a strange coincidence?  agent_2:Ha ha. Maybe. Unsurprisingly, there has not been a president that was not a democrat or republican since 1853.  agent_1:Well I believe either Roosevelt or JFK came very close as a uncorrelated 3rd party. agent_2:You may be correct. I was floored to learn that the last time until very recently that a Republican president was elected without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was 1928! agent_1:Wow! I didn't know the extent to which the Nixons and Bushs were so influential. I also recently found out that the colors of red and blue associated with republicans and democrats was a recent change, only starting in 2000. I wonder if they used any other colors before then? agent_2:That is a good question. I would have thought it had been that way for a longer time period than that. Did you know that Truman visited Disneyland and would not be photographed on the Dumbo ride so he wasn't associated with Republicans.  agent_1:Well for politicians image is everything. At least at some level of politics, the US has been quite progressive. For instance, Texas' first elected female governor came into office even before some states ratified the 19th amendment	agent_2:Wow, I would not have thought that, especially with it being such a conservative state.

The sacramento library even has a library of things agent_1:A prisoner used the library resources to become a lawyer. agent_2:I know! it was a really good use of resources. He proved his innocence and now helps others do the same agent_1:That's amazing. There are all kinds of old stats and info to discover, too. agent_2:Yeah you can get unrestricted access to information in many different formats agent_1:Appling was busted on an old baseball story because researchers contradicted his claim. agent_2:I heard he was really good at fouling pitches. Including 14 straight. agent_1:It would be great to see a new interview with him but he passed away in 1991. agent_2:Yeah I would like to hear his opinion on Belt's 21 pitch at bat agent_1:I wonder if he would change when presented with the Yankees stats. agent_2:He had a good time playing against Red Ruffing. He liked messing with him agent_1:It sounds like Appling used that strategy a lot. agent_2:Unfortunately we dont have enough stat going back far enough since at bats and pitch by pitch only started getting record in 1988 agent_1:He bragged about fouling out players, agent_2:Do you think Brandon Belt could do the same	agent_1:He used the same strategy to run out 12 minutes 45 seconds of gametime.	agent_2 likes video games. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['video games', 'sports', 'favorite baseball player'].
3884	agent_1:Hello, did you know the dodo bird is actual a sub-family of the pigeon. agent_2:I didn't know that- of course I believe the bird is extinct, isn't it?  This year we recently had a bunch of hummingbirds..that was a first for me and so exciting. SO TINY.. agent_1:I also find it interesting that some birds can fly from alaska to north america without sleeping when they migrate. agent_2:Birds are very interesting because of a lot of facts.  I think it helps with their flight that their bones are hollow so not weighed down.  agent_1:Yes, they are interesting. I did not know that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. I find that very interersting. agent_2:I have watched them pull some to make them nearby.  The way they flit about is so beautiful to watch.  It is almost elegant like a dance. ..performing art! agent_1:Yes, did you know that Jackie Chan manages a k-pop band. I did not know that but i think it's cool. agent_2:It seems that so many you wouldn't think to have other interests do.  Jackie in music, Bruce Lee in dancing.  A championship even! agent_1:It seems to be in a kpop band you have to be tough because they go through bootcamps before being signed. agent_2:Boot camps for bands.. Guess it takes a lot of stamina for the dancing and singing.  Kind of the same I would assume for figure skating.  Can you imagine the work to land a triple axel? agent_1:That is true. It looks hard. Did you know babies spontaneously dance when they hear music. They are cute. agent_2:Music is a wonderful thing, so much to come out of it.  Symbiotic relationship with dance and music. Tupac was able to do both- never would have thought ballet for him though. agent_1:Yes, that definitely does not fit his image. I was surprised that ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week. That is a lot. agent_2:The tip starts to break down and doesn't hold form.  Same with skates, have to keep them sharp or can't get the edge for spins and jumps. Would have to assume that Nagasu goes through a lot of skates for this reason. agent_1:I like that she wanted to do the triple axel so bad that she dreamed she could . That shows heart for wanting to do something. agent_2:Especially when she had been passed over for the previous Olympics.  Rippon omitted his quad jump at the start, not as much heart I guess. agent_1:And she is part of the record books for being the first U.S. lady to land triple axel in olympic competition. agent_2:She had her wish of making America proud.  Guess the same can't be said for the Russians because of the prior doping scandal. agent_1:Yes, the doping scandal can be hard to come back from. It is amazing the amount of doping in sports today. agent_2:You would think that rather than compromising, like the Olympic committee did, they would just start to ban them.  Isn't teaching them anything to allow certain numbers to still participate and medal. agent_1:That's true. Did you know Michael Jackson had a patent on his leaning dance move. agent_2:I didn't know that there was a device involved in it.  Wonder with his death if the patent transferred to someone? agent_1:Maybe it got passed down to his children. agent_2:He certainly was talented.  Wonder if he did his own choreography? agent_1:I think he did. He worked too hard and I think that is what caused his death. He had his whole family to take care of really. agent_2:So much control.  At least after he left Jackson 5 he had some freedom unlike the kids in K pop. Agencies controlling everything. Yikes! agent_1:That is true and to think K-pop had it's first group of women in the 60's is surprising. I thought k-pop was pretty new. agent_2:I was vaguely familiar with H.O.T. , Korean version of Backstreet Boys. Social networking and YouTube have launched a lot of the Korean Wave. agent_1:Yes and they have the loudest and most loyal fans. agent_2:I wonder if because they are now going global with this music if you will start to see fusion music.  Would mix well with Latin beats. agent_1:I like that when North korea sank a south korean warship they blasted the k-pop song hit your heart on loud speakers. agent_2:I wonder if that song was by their own K pop girl band, moranbong,  or if they selected it from someone else? agent_1:Moranbong  band was  the most popular music group in the country. They must have a lot of fans.	agent_2:It is generally classified that way..K Pop.

Pretty cool! Did you know that Since 1900, the taller candidate has won the us presidential election 75% of the time? agent_2:What! No, I did not know that, that is very interesting.  agent_1:Also, Astronauts vote from space, so the rest of us have no excuse not to make it to an election. 	agent_2:That is crazy, but understandable.

We like to grill a lot outside, which helps not make our home more hot. agent_2:Grilling out is the best to help with the heat inside the house. If I have to cook in the house i do it early in the morning before it gets too hot.	agent_1:Yes that's another great idea.

Did you know ballet dancers use a lot of shoes? agent_1:Yes they go through 4 pairs in a single week agent_2:Yeah that is a lot of shoes and also a lot of money agent_1:Yeah. Babies are also really good at dancing when they hear music agent_2:Yes and they smile more when they hit the beat agent_1:Yeah pretty cute. Did you know Tupac was a ballet dancer? agent_2:Yes he was in the nutcracker as the mouse king agent_1:Yeah. DO you like SHakespeare? agent_2:I love his work. Did you know he popularized many terms that we use to this day? agent_1:Yes terms like, good riddance, in my heart of heart and such agent_2:Yes. He lives at the same time as Pocahontas did agent_1:I wonder if they had met what he would have written about her.	agent_2:Yeah good point.

10365	agent_1:Do you tend to follow elections in the country? agent_2:Yes I plan to, it heard to decide who to vote for, I almost gave up on voting at one point. agent_1:I know how that feels; sometimes it seems like there's no good option. I can see why voter turnout has been under 70% in the past hundred years. agent_2:Yes that's true, are you plan to vote in next election? agent_1:I try to vote every time. I missed the first election when I was eligible, but the last presidential election was very interesting, so I try to research and vote every time now. agent_2:Not being personal but do you that your entire voting was negative and no positive with the president? agent_1:I definitely felt like I was voting against someone more than I was voting for someone. Was that how you felt too? agent_2:Well, I felt a little like that, My main concern is that I knew this country is going down hill with killing, drugs, rich, poor, I just wanted a change. agent_1:That's how I felt too. I think the influence of the media was a major factor. According to actual rates, it's safer than it ever was in the past, but we're able to hear about so much more. agent_2:Yes, you are right and nothing to very little is been done about it. We really need a strong and respectful leader. agent_1:Most of all we need a leader that can unify us. Elections seem so polarized lately that it will be hard to find one, though. Nobody wins if they campaign as a compromiser. agent_2:That's true, but it doesn't matter what kind of president we get, he or she will not satisfy everyone, so that's why I always say do what best for our country, this is just my opinion.  agent_1:I agree with you completely, and I appreciate the way you say it in a respectful and nonpartisan manner. The best for the country is something that everyone should strive for. agent_2:That's true such as jobs, health Insurance and so many other things.  I thinks a leader like that will be hard to find. agent_1:The difficult part is that everyone has their own idea of what's best for the country, and sometimes the politicians they agree with don't fulfill their promises. agent_2:You are right, since I was voting, Presidents speak of good things that people want to hear and after 8 years nothing change and this was going on for years.	agent_1:I think it would help to get some new faces in politics and reform some of the systems that may have worked decades ago, but aren't as functional in modern times.	agent_2 likes politics. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'election', 'election'].

Is it live action or not? agent_1:I was a big Lion King fan, have you seen it? agent_2:No they haven't come out with the Remake yet. But I did see the stage show and I also saw a movie which are both great. Julie Taymor directed the Broadway musical by the way agent_1:They made it dubbed in zulu for african release, that was nice of them agent_2:Yes I agree. I also like how revolutionary Disney was with their use of multi-plane cameras, that really adds to an animated scene and they used it in Bambi agent_1:For sure, it is amazing what they can do. Frozen was a good song, ever seen it? agent_2:Yes I did like that movie. I think it was the first Disney movie to be directed by a woman.   agent_1:For sure, that is a good stat. They need more women directing disney movies  agent_2:Yes I think so. What do you think about the movie Big Hero 6? That was actually decent, it's not my favorite but it is impressive they used a 50,000 core computer to render it agent_1:Wow, I did not know. I liked that movie and it makes sense. agent_2:Did you ever see the movie Up by the way? Apparently it would take 9 million balloons to actually lift the house LOL that's insane agent_1:Lol, that would be so many balloons, and so much helium! People would be talking funny for days if they all popped. agent_2:Haha that's a good point.

I guess dogs and elephants can do that. agent_2:Yeah they are smart. Did you know that they are not color blind, but they can't see as many different colors as humans? agent_1:I didn't know that, but that's cool. Did you know google prefers dogs to cats? agent_2:I've heard that their code of conduct specifically states that. That's pretty cool! agent_1:Speaking of cats, when a cat reaches 15, they've spent 10 of it sleeping. Must be nice! agent_2:That's funny. Did you know there's a town in Alaska has had a cat as its mayor since 1997.  agent_1:They have my vote! Cats are famous sometimes, even one from the Godfather part 1 that was a stray on set! agent_2:Did you know there's cat cafe's in Japan and Taiwan where people can pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks. I wonder if that would go over well here. agent_1:I think it would with dogs, since they perform many roles for humans! agent_2:I didn't know that they have 12 different blood types. 	agent_1:Me neither! They also have dog blood drives for them to donate to!	agent_2 likes hobby. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobby', 'travel', 'cat cafe'].

12203	agent_1:Hi there, do you watch video on YouTube? agent_2:Occasionally. I like to play Bob Ross' Joy of Painting for my dogs while I'm at work, and YouTube has full episodes of it. agent_1:Yeah I like him too. You Tube is the second largets search engine nowadays agent_2:I'm not surprise. At one point, it consumed as much bandwidth as the entire internet in 2000. agent_1:Yeah that is crazy. Bieber's Baby song seems to be the most disliked video in there. Poor guy agent_2:I don't feel as badly for him as I do for the three guys who created YouTube. Evidently, Google bought it for only 1.65 billion dollars over a decade ago. I feel like it's probably worth way more now! agent_1:I bet it is for sure. Have you heard of Bluetube? agent_2:I haven't. What is BlueTube? agent_1:It is a police YouTube and you can check out law enforcement videos in it agent_2:That's pretty cool. I remember when YouTube was completely free, and was mostly cute animals. agent_1:Yeah the good times. Did you know they had to increase the video view after Gangnam Style came out? agent_2:That's crazy. I wonder how many views the very first upload has by new. That one with the guy talking about an elephant.	agent_1:Yeah I wonder about that too.

2494	agent_1:Hello. Do you play any video games? agent_2:I do play games.  I enjoy the call of duty game series. agent_1:I also enjoy that game. Did you know video games were initially called cathode ray tube amusement devices and were used by the military? agent_2:Yes, cathode ray tubes have come and gone and the game plays on.  I have a Playstation 3, but no plans to upgrade.   agent_1:I have a ps3 as well. I dont see the point to buying a ps4. This one is all I need as well. agent_2:The game Destiny turned me off gaming.  It was fun to play, but it demands network connectivity.  Sometimes the old games are just fun.  Donkey Kong and Mario are still OK.  I see Fifa 14 works on PS2, PS3 and PS4. agent_1:I was never into soccer games. I liked Madden though. Did you know that ps3s are being used to research black holes. agent_2:Yes, people let them run and they network together.  Sort of like the 1760 PS3's used by the department of defense to make a super computer.  Never tried Madden. agent_1:Never played madden. You will have to try it. How about grand theft auto. Have you played that one? agent_2:I do indeed love GTA.  I want to say that I played early rev levels on a PC.  It was a different game back then. FUDGE RIPPLE!  I will search for a disk and see if it is audio. agent_1:THe original game when played in a cd player would play the soundtrack to the game. agent_2:Interesting.  Have you ever had carpel tunnel syndrome brought on by playing games?	agent_1:Actually I have. I dont know if that is why I got it though.

7377	agent_1:Hello there hope you're doing well. Do you like the fantasy genre? I like it because it's roots are in oral traditions. agent_2:I like fantasy drafts. Lol agent_1:Yeah fantasy drafts are fun- and even fantasy drafts are done for the national spelling bee! agent_2:I haven't ever done that. There is also a draft for congress. agent_1:Type of people participate in these things? I think it would be boring. A single fold in the brain makes a difference between perceiving reality and fantasy. agent_2:Have you ever heard of terry pratchett agent_1:Yeah I think so I can't believe he was knighted for services to literature. He must have made some great contributions. agent_2:He really has. What an honor as well.	agent_1:Yeah he must've been so proud. There was once a janitor from Chicago who wrote over six years of fantasy manuscript. He must've really been into it.	agent_2 likes hobbies. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobbies', 'fantasy drafts', 'work'].

Surprised I haven't heard of it agent_1:Wow did you know that Astronauts can vote from space.  agent_2:That is so cool. Not all men in the uk had the vote until 1918. agent_1:Every US president with a beard has been a republican.  agent_2:Thats funny. It should be mandatory to have a beard if youre a president! Ha agent_1:Right! The use of red and blue for Dems and Repu only started in 2000. I would have thought it was longer.  agent_2:Right! I thought it would have been more than 19 years! agent_1:The toy industry gets involved before the beginning of the production of a movie according to disney. agent_2:And the development of the Disney film wreck it ralph started in the late 80's. agent_1:Wow spanning nearly 3 decades with four working titles. 	agent_2:Just remarkable.

5477	agent_1:do you like the piano? agent_2:I love it  is such a classic instrument, and you? agent_1:Me too. BBC once played piano tunes all day instead of the news agent_2:Yeah because there was no newsworthy news that day agent_1:Yeah. Did you know Mercury and McCartney used the same piano to compose their songs? agent_2:Yes Bohemian Rhapsody and Hey Jude, respectively agent_1:Yeah. Have you heard of circus gallop? agent_2:Yes that is the stress testing tune for pianos right? agent_1:Yes that one but no human can play it, strange agent_2:Yes I know. THere is a piano on top of the tallest mountain in the UK agent_1:Yeah and no one still knows how it got there agent_2:Yeah strange for sure. The instrument goes back to 1700 though, pretty old agent_1:Nice. Do you shop online at all? agent_2:Yes all the time, I like Amazon and you? agent_1:Me too. Did you know jeff built a clock on a mountain? agent_2:Yeah and it is supposed to run for 10 000 years agent_1:Yeah.

2789	agent_1:Hello, do you ever watch Fox News? agent_2:I usually don't watch it. I understand that it's popular. agent_1:Fox discussed the possibility of creating a cable channel that would only air the Simpsons. agent_2:That is an idea that might work, but now I figure people are on the Internet. Maybe a YouTube channel? agent_1:Possibly...The gaming website IGN is actually owned by Fox News. agent_2:Oh, I didn't know that. I guess Fox owns a lot of things out there. A gaming site? Hm. agent_1:Yea very interesting. Fox News is watched more than CNN and MSNBC combined. agent_2:I believe it. CNN has its own bias, as does MSNBC. People watch what they want to believe. agent_1:Yep, not a huge fan of CNN because they post so much fake news and are very biased. agent_2:I don't watch CNN. What kind of fake news?	agent_1:They just report things that are fake or swayed to the liberal spectrum of politics. Fox News was created by Richard Ailes and Richard Nixon.	agent_2 dislikes news. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['news', 'news', 'no'].
13531	agent_1:I just had a long day of playing video games. How was your day? agent_2:Hello,  sounds rough,  hope you can make it through the convo lol My day has been pretty great,  cant complain.  Did you know there is a planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways? agent_1:Did not know that! It seems to me that you are interested in space? agent_2:I like space.  Not enough to be hugely educated in it though lol I know Jupiter's storms can be heard on an Am radio though!  Never actually listened to it.  agent_1:Do you believe that life exists outside of Earth? I'm on the fence, but I've heard that astronomers have some evidence of life 455 light-years away. agent_2:Yes,  I think so.  Its just weird that out of all those planets and space and galaxies that we are the only planet with life.  agent_1:I agree. Sometimes I just look at the moon at night and think about how small we all are compared to what else is out there! agent_2:I know right,  just thinking about space and everything out there is very humbling.  We are so tiny.  agent_1:We definitely are. Have you ever seen the movie Wall-E? Some of it takes place on a spaceship! agent_2:I have seen it but I dont remember all of it lol.   agent_1:I just love that movie. I love Pixar. Did you know that they have a secret room that is often visited by celebrities? agent_2:I did,  Ive always wondered what was in there lol I hope free sandwiches lol  agent_1:I'm sure there are. Celebrities have a lot of perks. Wish I was one! agent_2:Robin Williams was the first actor to start the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films.  That seems fun,  I wouldnt mind being a voice actor,  I do not want to be a celebrity at all,  just rich lol Seems like they have a tough life.  agent_1:Yeah, but being rich takes a load of stress off of your shoulders. For example, Judge Judy makes $123,000 per episode!	agent_2:Yeah thats why I would just want to be rich,  i dont care about being a celebrity at all. 	agent_1 dislikes celebrity. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['celebrity', 'TV shows', 'favorite TV show'].
10888	agent_1:Hi, how are you? Are you a music fan? agent_2:I listen to music whenever I can! I haven't been to a concert in a minute, but I tend to really enjoy those when it's an act I'm a fan of. I can appreciate orchestra, too, though. agent_1:Same, I do like some orchestra stuff like John Williams and the guy who does the Game of Thrones music. Can't say I would ever go to an orchestra festival like Shift though. agent_2:Festivals can be very stimulating but also very underwhelming or disappointing if they're not organized correctly. It sounds like Shift was not executed as well as it could have been, even if it was well-intended. agent_1:I think I haven't been to a concert myself in over 5 years, the last one being the Foo Fighters. agent_2:I saw REO Speedwagon and Chicago back last summer, and it reminded me that those shows are NOT fun if the music isn't loud. I heard the Foo Fighters played a concert so loud in New Zealand that it registered on seismic monitors! agent_1:That's awesome! I saw the first Global Citizen concert in Central Park that had Foo Fighters, Black Keys and Neil Young. That one was amazing. Huge venue in the park. agent_2:That sounds fun--I guess that's kind of the ultimate venue for a festival. I was invited to a house concert last month and turned it down because it didn't sound fun, but there's a huge range in the kind of places you can have one. I suppose intimate venues work well for solo performances or ensembles involving instruments like pianos or violins. agent_1:Have you ever been to cgbg in NYC? The Ramones used to play there back in the day pretty often.	agent_2:I'm familiar with both, but I think I'm too young to have experienced either of those things live haha. 	agent_1 dislikes live events. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['live events', 'music', 'travel'].
11518	agent_1:did you know that a hockey player can lose up to eight pounds over the course of one game agent_2:Hi! No I didn't know that, are you a hockey fan? agent_1:kind of, I'm watching the superbowl right now though haha, I guess Canada's national sports are both hockey and lacrosse, I would have thought it was just hockey agent_2:Ahah 100%, and that is weird yeah I would've thought it's just hockey by far. It's obviously much bigger in Canada than here though. I know the U.S. Olympic Women's team lost to a New England high school team once. agent_1:ya Canada is really good, I guess one year at the Olympics they scored 132 goals and only let in 3! agent_2:God I can't imagine the other team's disappointment. That must be how Bulgaria felt when their women's team lost to Slovakia 82-0.   agent_1:that is crazy, are you a dog or a cat person? agent_2:I'm definitely more of a dog person, and yourself? agent_1:yes I like dogs a lot more, did you know that Google is officially a pro-dog company? haha agent_2:Wow, I wonder how they even chose that! Although it makes sense, dogs are intelligent, they can actually learn over 1000 words! agent_1:wow that is wild, did you know that dogs have over 12 different blood types? agent_2:Definitely more complex than humans all of a sudden. They can also be just like us though, some dogs have even learnt how to use the subway. agent_1:ya they're so smart, also I always thought that dogs were colorblind, but they actually just can't see as many colors as a person can agent_2:That's interesting, dogs are certainly more than we give credit to. Dogs even have eureka moments, just like we do! agent_1:that is crazy! also, only dogs and elephants respond and understand pointing, no other animals do! agent_2:Haha I guess elephants are intelligent too! On another note, are you a Disney movie fan?	agent_1:yes I am, one of my favorite movies is Dumbo, speaking of elephants haha	agent_2 likes movie. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'pets', 'Google'].
1281	"agent_1:There was man who was falsely imprisoned. He used the prison library to study law and learn to free himself. That is amazing don't you think? agent_2:That is awesome! Speaking of libraries, there are more libraries than McDonalds in the United States. Do you have a library card? agent_1:I do and that is good to hear. Also, half of adult have library cards that seems like more than I would have thought. agent_2:I know. I don't know that a lot of my friends go to the library. The Sacramento Library has instituted a type of library that might make going to the library more interesting to many. They started a library of things, so you can check out sewing machines and other things that you don't need to own for a long time. agent_1:That would be so useful. I wonder if other cities do that? I know that normal library collections often included DVD's and CD's and other things besides books. agent_2:Yes, and I have also checked out passes to various museums in my city. I'm glad some people were dedicated to starting libraries in the past as they have been so useful to me. Have you heard of UK Prime Minister William Gladstone? agent_1:I have. I heard that he started a library in 1895 with 32,000 books in it. All from his personal collection. Can you imagine? agent_2:The more amazing thing to me is how he carted all those books by wheelbarrow over 3/4 mile. He was 85! agent_1:Maybe his daughter helped him. I wonder how many were Shakespeare plays. I was reading one at the library. Did you know that Shakespear coined many of the terms we use today, including ""good riddance"" and ""laughing stock?"" agent_2:Oh, that's interesting. I would never have thought as luck would have it, break the ice, and full circle were from Shakespeare. agent_1:I guess it makes sense that he coined so many terms since he was the world's greatest dramatist. Plus, he wrote so much. He wrote 39 plays! agent_2:Not only did he coin terms, but he created names. The names Miranda, Olivia and Jessica were invented by Shakespeare. I didn't know those names went so far back! agent_1:That is interesting. I wonder if these names sound different with the accent of the time. I know the accent can affect the meaning of the performance. The old accent can introduce rhymes or puns that don't work with our modern tongue. What might Miranda sound like in Shakespeare's voice? agent_2:That is an interesting thought. Shakespeare has been translated into every major language. I wonder how they preserve Shakespeare's style and language in other languages. agent_1:That is a good question. It would be interesting to study that in school. I bet people use to study Shakespeare in school more than they do now. I hear that people often studied the Bible in school before 1963. agent_2:Yes, the Bible does still play a large role in our lives though. Presidents are still sworn in with them. I wonder why Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams did not use Bibles at their swearing in ceremonies. agent_1:That is true. It does play a role still. Plus it was influenced by real history. For example, the tower of Babel was probably based on a real building in what is now Iraq. agent_2:Thomas Jefferson didn't seem to agree with all parts of the Bible. He made his own version and cut out the supernatural parts. I wonder why that was. agent_1:Interesting!. All so at least three Presidents saw the Bible differently (Jefferson, Roosevelt and Adams.) Iti is interesting to think about how the Bible changes too. For example, the apple from Adam and Eve was a translation from the 4th century. agent_2:That's true. And different Bible canons have evolved over the century with overlapping contents but also diverging contents. agent_1:Yes. In fact, the what is seen as canonical depends on the traditions of different groups."	agent_2:That is what cuases disagreement between CHristian denominations about what should be included in the canon.	agent_1 likes Christianity. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['Christianity', 'TV shows', 'canon'].
2209	agent_1:hi how are you doing over there on that side of the internets agent_2:Hi! Hope you're doing well! So are you a fan of The Walt Disney Company? One of my favorite characters is Minnie Mouse and I was surprised to recently find out her name is short for Minerva Mouse! agent_1:i like disney though i havent watched a disney film in a while. i do like minnie. she is cute as the dickens. agent_2:Well there's actually a hidden subculture dedicated to finding hidden Mickey mouse images in all things Disney, you should definitely check out! agent_1:i guess if you find a mickey, you win something? if i find one, i guess i should tell others and not keep it secret. agent_2:That's a good point! Ha! Unless they change the locations up!  Are you also a fan of Bill Nye? He actually served as a science consultant on Flubber, believe it or not! agent_1:i guess he knows a bit about the science of hypothetical substances. he is an entertaining fellow for sure. agent_2:Indeed he is! I also think it's amazing that Big Hero 6 was rendered with a 55,000 core supercomputer. That is amazing! agent_1:that is astonishing. i wonder how many processors theyll need for big hero 7. i dint see the other big hero movies. agent_2:Probably a lot more than 55,000. Ha! Did you ever see Wall-E? If so, the name is actually a tip of the hat to Walter Elias Disney himself!	agent_1:that is cute. i wondered why they pickt such a strange name for a robot but now i see. but he dint have a mustache.	agent_2 likes TV show. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV show', 'money', 'prizes'].
10705	agent_1:Hi, how are you? agent_2:Me? i guess im pretty good. how are you doing? everything going all right? get enough to eat there? thats good. what do you think about the moon? agent_1:I'm good, thanks for asking.  It's so overcast, I can't really see it tonight.  How about you? agent_2:i have not looked at the moon recently, but i think that it has been doing all right. The highest point on the moon is 1938 meters higher than mt. everest! I wonder if they have 3g and wireless up there. agent_1:I doubt it, but you never know? Lol I hear moon dust can cut through Kevlar like material and is harmful to us humans. agent_2:boy, that is good to know. i never realized the dangers of visiting the moon. i guess ill wait until disney sets up a theme park there. when does spielberg make his first dinosaur moon movie? agent_1:That's cool!  Well if anyone could make a movie like that it would be Spielberg.  He's made some good ones, Jaws, E.T. The Color purple,and Jurassic Park, just to name a few. agent_2:dinosaurs on the moon. shot on location. that would be great! Summer was considered a bad time to release a movie in the theater because of low sales until Jaws. agent_1:Now, it's the best time.  My how times change!  Did you know he played the clarinet on the Jaws soundtrack? agent_2:he is a gifted artist. i wonder how good his clarinet skills are. why did he get that gig? he made enough as the director. agent_1:Can you say control?  I read he still makes millions from Star Wars off a bet he made with George Lucas in 1977. agent_2:yes, that bet about star wars and close encounters. george really blew it on that one. that is funny. still george has billions.  agent_1:What's a friendly wager among billionaire friends?  	agent_2:at the time, they were not billionaires. but george learned the value of his franchise. he made a ton off other movies before though. 	agent_1 likes movie. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'space', 'moon'].
13353	agent_1:Hello my name is Dave, how are you this fine day? It think it is pretty crazy that parachutes of space vehicles are made from fabric you can buy at a fabric store. agent_2: Yeah it seems like that material is very high tech but easily accessible. Do you follow science news alot? agent_1:Not really. I do like reading articles like these though because I do like learning new things and I find science pretty interesting. I can't imagine all of the tests that scientists must have to run in order to figure out what materials to use for things. agent_2:I beleive the scientists doing this research will eventually find and even better material for a supersonic parachute. I think space exploration is the future of the US.  agent_1:Yeah I think you're right. What do you think about life on Mars? Do you think that Mars or any other planet will ever be able to sustain life on it? agent_2:I think there is microscopic life on mars possibly but more likely there is something on one of the outer moons of saturn, jupiter.  agent_1:Yeah. It would be pretty crazy to see that happen in our lifetime but it seems like it is pretty far off.	agent_2:I think they should send a rover soon to one of the outer planets to get a closer look and potentially find life. If a rover can find something then we could potentally send a human to check.	agent_1 likes space. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['space', 'news', 'science'].
10488	agent_1:Hi, do you use Amazon? agent_2:Hi, are you interested in Google, Amazon, or Artificial Intelligence? agent_1:All three of those actually. They are two of the biggest innovators we have and one of the most interesting scientific fields. agent_2:Yes, I agree. I really enjoy AI although all three of these topics are probably so interrelated that we don't realize it. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is sometimes called machine intelligence (which is actually demonstrated by the machines) in contrast to human intelligence. agent_1:Yes it is amazing what we can hopefully apply AI to in the future. It can really help out with some difficult tasks. agent_2:I took Computer Science in college and it is defined as the study of 'intelligent agents' or any device that perceives the environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. agent_1:I only took a basic Computer Science course, we never delved into Artificial Intelligence. I don't know too much about it besides some basic reading. agent_2:I learned some stuff in Master's level courses and colloquially, the term 'artificial intelligence' is applied when a machine mimics 'cognitive functions' that humans associate with other human minds such as 'learning' and 'problem solving'. agent_1:What do you think the biggest priority should be in the application of Artificial Intelligence? agent_2:Actually, the scope of AI is disputed as machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered as requiring 'intelligence' are often removed from the definition, a phenomenon known as the AI effect, leading to the quip in Teslar's Theorem, 'AI is whatever hasn't been done yet.'	agent_1:I know some people are afraid of AI and think machines will become too self aware. I don't think we will ever run into that problem, science fiction has made people too paranoid.	agent_2 likes technology. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['technology', 'hobbies', 'AI priority'].
393	agent_1:Good Morning! How are you today? agent_2:Well, you may be on the other side of the fence but I like neither Kanye nor Trump. agent_1:I couldn't have said it any better lol. That was such an odd meeting between them two a couple months ago! agent_2:I recall the time that Kanye stood up to a President when he perceived racism, now he seems to have flipped.  I guess they money makes a big difference, agent_1:A very big difference. He even thinks AIDS is a man-made disease! agent_2:People love a good conspiracy story.  I think that is how Trump does so well, people believe in the Deep State, and such. agent_1:I agree! What kind of music do you like to listen to? agent_2:I'm a kid of the eighties and nineties,  I never really moved on from that alternative rock scene. agent_1:Same here! I think rap has been a major significance in the last twenty years though huh? agent_2:There has been the odd rap song that I like, but for me it's cultural.  I'm just not from the environment most rappers are and can't appreciate their point of view. agent_1:I agree too! I can't believe a michigan judge once delivered her ruling to eminem in the form of a rap haha. agent_2:That's kind of cool, I like it when people don't take themselves too seriously.  Like when Kanye made fun of himself on SNL.  If only he'd do it more. agent_1:All he has to do is talk and it happens haha. I give him props though, he once gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair at a concert. However, I'm sure he told a person to stand up in a wheelchair before too..... agent_2:Funny.  Are you one for hats?  Probably not a MAGA hat, but hat's in general?  agent_1:I wear hats when I'm out hiking, but that is about it, how about you? agent_2:Generally not.  I'm originally from the UK so I guess most people would associate me with a bowler hat, but never really worn any type of hat. agent_1:It took me awhile to figure out what it looks like but now I know. Wasn't that the most popular hat in the old west too? agent_2:I'm guessing that is because of TV and movies, we get this idea of the way it is shown when reality is somewhat different. Being self deprecating, I'd say a dunces cap suits me well. agent_1:Well said! I think it suits me well too haha. That is where the conical party hat was derived from! agent_2:Or maybe we could give it to Mr West next time he wants to speak his mind to us.  	agent_1:Or just when he is walking around being the odd self he is. Anyways, I had a great chat with you, have an awesome day!	agent_2 likes small talk. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['small talk', 'hobby', 'no'].

I know that Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fictino. agent_1:I'm not a huge fan to be honest.  agent_2:Hhaha I was when I was little more than I am now.  In the 1950's a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic because it featured a black character.  What a sad sign of the times back then. agent_1:Did you know the FDA burned 6 tons of literature in an act of censorship. agent_2:I didn't know that.

10067	agent_1:Have you seen the movie Solaris? agent_2:No.  Do you know anything more about it? agent_1:I just think the theme is fascinating ... the tension arising from floating around a planet, but never landing.  Have you felt that way in life? agent_2:No.  I did learn lately that our planet is also called Gaia. agent_1:Oh, I mean, where you're constantly in flux and you see everyone else with concrete life happening and making progress ... and you're not. agent_2:I read about a planet that orbits 4 stars.  Perhaps that would parallel the concept you are discussing.  The direction would be hard to determine. agent_1:Interesting.  I've heard of dual-stars, but this is four?  Normally planets just have the one star, so that would be extraordinary. agent_2:Clearly the universe is amazing.  Early humans could study it some since 5 planets are visible to the naked eye. agent_1:I don't think I could tell the difference between them.  But just imagine having the time and attention to discern that there are five different ones, all without photography! agent_2:No doubt!  Previous generations were intelligent too.  As long ago as 1975, the Soviets sent a spacecraft to Venus and mankind saw pictures of the surface. agent_1:I'd say they were smarter.  I think the current generation only feels smart because we've got all this technology and knowledge at our fingertips.  So then, we feel like we can fill all our time with comedy. agent_2:Great point.  They created wealth that allows free time in our lifetime.  Evan Almighty was a comedy that had a budget of $200 million. agent_1:And what else could be done with $200 million?  Probably something much more important. agent_2:I think that it is neat that it can be done.  The $200 million did not disappear.  Cameramen, actors and many others received income from it. It is not as respected as some other genres.  It has been 37 years since a comedy won Best Picture. agent_1:True.  What film was that?  For as popular as comedies are, you'd think it would not have been so long. agent_2:I don't know the film.  However, The Empire Strikes back was nominated for best comedy in 1981 by the Writers Guild.  That is strange. agent_1:Calling something a comedy when it's not really makes you think about it ... have we all been viewing it wrongly?  Such organizations sometimes get it wrong, like when 3rd Rock from the Sun won for best comedy series over Seinfeld, Friends, and Frasier in 1997. agent_2:What do you call 3rd Rock?  Satire is comedy also. agent_1:I'd call it comedy, satirical for sure, but just not better than Seinfeld. agent_2:Oh!  I agree with you on that.  Awards have a political factor in decision making.  I saw that Drew Carey did stand up in the Marines for 8 years before he started making money from comedy. agent_1:Sometimes it takes while to get it right and then cash in.  I'm glad some networks like Comedy Central take risks and then cancel shows if they flop.  They've cancelled over 100 shows in the past three decades. agent_2:Wow. That is a lot of shows to cancel.  We have so many channels now that most shows that are good can find an audience.   agent_1:And enough people willing to explore them all until they find them.  If you asked me to watch tv from another country to find something I like, it would take me weeks.  Americans seem to just put in that effort on a regular basis.	agent_2:Well.

Do you like movies? agent_2:I like movies, it is a form of art. .  agent_1:This is interesting..Even though spartacus had a cinematographer, stanley kubrick took the camera away from him and did it himself.  agent_2:You have to do it yourself, he was very talented, I saw some of his films, but never Spartacus, is it good ?  agent_1:It is! But this is interesting too..even though he did almost none of the work, when spartacus got the academy award for best cinematography, it went to the credited cinematographer, and not kubrick. agent_2:Probably, some kind of union thing, like he was not an official cinematographer.  I wonder if they gave him something for it.  agent_1:Thats a good question! No woman has ever been nominated for the academy award for best cinematography. agent_2:I guess it is because there is not many female cinematographer because they would not hire them. Sexism still exist.  agent_1:That is terrible. A woman has never even been nominated. agent_2:Yeah, do you see movies made by a woman ? agent_1:I haven't paid attention to that. I'll have to now. Cinematographer roger deakins has been nominated 13 times for the best cinematography oscar, and has never won. agent_2:He was good but not enough, did he do any comedies ? I like those kind of film.  agent_1:I don't think he did. Do you like Bill murray? Bill murray thinks kung fu hustle is ""the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy"". agent_2:I like Bill Murray, Chinese comedies can be really funny.

They were really scared. agent_1:Yeah, i remember that! With japan being so small it can cost you $300 to drive across it if you take the highway. Tolls are crazy expensive!  agent_2:Thats crazy! That is just like Hawaii too. agent_1:Are all of their Highways tolled? Are they expensive?  agent_2:They are really cram packed with cars but no tolls. The bad thing about being there is that a missile can get there from North Korea in less than 30  mins. agent_1:Whoa, thats crazy! I had no idea they were so close! Funny to think that China believes that Kim jong un is the sexiest man alive! agent_2:Wow, I did not know that! Yikes! In the era of Kim Jong-un we have to worry about his ability to send a missile over and that's a little scary. agent_1:I agree! Ill be interested to see how the meeting with US president goes later this month. I don't think he is stable.  He assassinated his own half brother. 	agent_2:I agree.   He caused terror in Hawaii without even actually sending a missile. The people who were in church during the threat message were told to repent and to end mass early.

The modern game of tennis is originated in England. agent_1:Do you know how long the longest game of tennis lasted? agent_2:Tennis played in ancient period at 12 century. In modern used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis court. There are very aggressive fan for tennis. agent_1:The longest game of tennis was 11 hours long.  They had to spread it over three days!  That is crazy about the helicopters thought.

I also didn't know Wonder Woman's first film appearance was in the Lego Movie agent_1:Gal gadot has seved in israel defence force . I thought she was paegent queen agent_2:That is pretty cool. Did you know Wonder Woman was the justice Society's secretary in 1941? agent_1:no but it was the highest superhero origin movie. may be marvel movie may break this record soon agent_2:Probably.

I guess Myspace had the option to buy Facebook at one point, I'm sure they've never stopped regretting that decision!! agent_1:I know especially because they would have gotten it for a steal at 75 million. Apparently the like button is illegal in some German country.  agent_2:That's curious, I wonder why Germany would ban the 'like' button.  That seems random!!  If you lived in Iceland you could contribute to rewriting their constitution - via Facebook! agent_1:Yeah that sounds like a good idea or a really bad one. Burger king was trying to get ppl to unfriend facebook friends in exchange for a whooper. agent_2:That's crummy of them...and whoever did it!  Apparently Mark Zuckerburg is a little colorblind - that's why Facebook is mostly blue!  I like blue so I'm not complaining... agent_1:Yeah seems to work. They make most of there money from advertisement.  agent_2:Did you know that sounds have a higher pitch on Mars then they do on Earth?  Is the Mars rover equipped with speakers?? agent_1:I guess so, lol! Speaking of Mars apparently Bruno writes his own music.  agent_2:That doesn't surprise me!  I guess he wasn't good enough for Motown though, they dropped him years before he became a success! agent_1:I did not know that or that he was named after a professional wrestler, Bruno Sammartino. agent_2:That's funny!  I guess his parents were wrestling fans!!  But I heard his real name is Peter Gene Hernandez, so maybe Bruno is the wrestling fan? agent_1:Yeah looks like he was trying to avoid a stereo type as a Latin pop singer. I don't think it worked. agent_2:Maybe a little!  He does have a lot of mainstream success.  In 2023 they're planning on colonizing Mars, they're going to fund it by making it a reality TV show!	agent_1:I see!

She would love it LOL. I would also go to a Linkin Park concert, although I think they're singer passed away, back in 2001 they did like 324 concerts in only a year, that's like one per day almost agent_2:I grew up listening to Linkin Park and it hurt me when I found out Chester died. That is a lot of concerts, wow.  agent_1:Yep I agree with you. Would you ever watch a concert in an ancient Roman Amphitheater? Apparently Pink Floyd did a concert there, and there is one in Croatia that still does concerts to this day agent_2:That is insane, I think I would watch it just to experience it. I don't know if you know who Creed is, but apparently they were sued by four concert goers because their 2002 concert was really bad. agent_1:That's pretty funny haha. I would actually be embarrassed if I were them, do you play any instruments by the way? I personally play the piano agent_2:I know right! I don't really play any instruments, I use to play on a piano when I was a kid though. agent_1:Yeah I play the piano, I start to learn as an adult, I actually like it a lot. I didn't know that back in 1930, there was a day where there was literally no news and so the BBC just played piano music instead haha	agent_2:Oh cool, I'm glad you enjoy it.

Have you ever visited New Orleans? agent_1:No never, is it worth it ? It seems that every city has its style of jazz even Kansas City.   agent_2:That is very true, Kansas city jazz is much more hard-swinging and bluesy, so cool how different regions have different styles.  agent_1:Do you think gypsies have anything to do with Gypsy Jazz ? I have never heard of any gypsies communities on US soil.  agent_2:I am not sure, that sounds more like an eastern european type jazz with the musette waltzes, very interesting though.  agent_1:But I a more interested in ""challenging"" jazz styles, the less ""dance-able"" the better it is for me.  agent_2:Interesting, did you know that Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is super popular? agent_1:Yes, I have heard of it,  if jazz is new to them, they have 100 years of jazz music to play to their audience.  agent_2:That is true, there also is a women in Harlem who has been hosting free jazz concerts at her apartment every Sunday for 20 years, wonder how her neighbors all feel about it? agent_1:Yeah, and it is a weekly think, I tolerate a party once or twice per year, but every week, I would start to complain.

I missed the first election when I was eligible, but the last presidential election was very interesting, so I try to research and vote every time now. agent_2:Not being personal but do you that your entire voting was negative and no positive with the president? agent_1:I definitely felt like I was voting against someone more than I was voting for someone. Was that how you felt too? agent_2:Well, I felt a little like that, My main concern is that I knew this country is going down hill with killing, drugs, rich, poor, I just wanted a change. agent_1:That's how I felt too. I think the influence of the media was a major factor. According to actual rates, it's safer than it ever was in the past, but we're able to hear about so much more. agent_2:Yes, you are right and nothing to very little is been done about it. We really need a strong and respectful leader. agent_1:Most of all we need a leader that can unify us. Elections seem so polarized lately that it will be hard to find one, though. Nobody wins if they campaign as a compromiser. agent_2:That's true, but it doesn't matter what kind of president we get, he or she will not satisfy everyone, so that's why I always say do what best for our country, this is just my opinion.  agent_1:I agree with you completely, and I appreciate the way you say it in a respectful and nonpartisan manner. The best for the country is something that everyone should strive for. agent_2:That's true such as jobs, health Insurance and so many other things.  I thinks a leader like that will be hard to find. agent_1:The difficult part is that everyone has their own idea of what's best for the country, and sometimes the politicians they agree with don't fulfill their promises.	agent_2:You are right, since I was voting, Presidents speak of good things that people want to hear and after 8 years nothing change and this was going on for years.	agent_1 dislikes politics. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'politics', 'no'].

Nope! agent_2:That would be a hard no for me too. dang nature why you so scary LOL Crocodiles are more closely related to birds than they are to snakes and lizards. i guess i could move to australia agent_1:Australia's got crazy too! I remember a story of huge birds dropping dead out of the sky. Or maybe they were bats. Anyways, huge flying things falling from the sky! agent_2:yeah, lots of scary things there. crocodiles are pretty scary, but they are not related snakes LOL agent_1:Humans are not the only ones afraid of snakes. Monekys are too! agent_2:monkeys are smart, they know what is dangerous! i bet a lot of creatures are afraid  of snakes. agent_1:I wonder if they can tell the difference between snakes and legless lizards. agent_2:i bet they dont care. they fear anything that is close. i know i would! by the way, do you go to concerts much? agent_1:I do. Do you go to concerts much? agent_2:I used to go quite a bit when i was younger. now i dont really go. no time or money.  agent_1:I do not like the crowds any more. I like smaller venues and local music. agent_2:i dont like crowds either. not very intimate. i do like sitting near the stage and seeing the musicians up close. agent_1:I am more of a bar guy at the bar, just listening and relaxing. agent_2:yeah, i hear you. music to unwind. not dealing with crowds and hassles. would you ever sue a band for a bad performance? i wonder how mad i would have to be.	agent_1:Are you talking about Creed?

8342	agent_1:Good Morning! The weekend is very near. Have you got any plans? agent_2:Good morning! No I don't as yet.  I'd like to get out and see some stars some night soon.  I don't have a telescope that is all the powerful though. I imagine mine is more like Galileo's telescope.  Do you have plans? agent_1:Not so much yet. My brother is getting married though! so there's that! I am trying to find the right gift for them.  agent_2:Congratulations!  Have you considered wine for a gift?  I've heard that California chardonnays are very good for challenging perceptions of what wine should taste like. agent_1:My brother and I are not much of drinkers. I do know that wines can have more alcohol content than beer though. like average 14.3%? I feel like we can make an exception on drinking this occasion though.  agent_2:I think you can.  Some wines go good with food.  There is a wine, La Cabotte Colline Cotes-du-Rhone Blanc that goes good with seafood. agent_1:I have heard of white wine pairing good with seafood, but honestly I'm not sure what food they're going to have. I think maybe pasta or steak? agent_2:That sounds good.  I've heard that red wines go good with beef.  I think there is a wine out of Tierra de Castilla, Spain that is said to be a good partner for meat and pasta dishes. agent_1:I might just go with that option. I've always thought of wine to be high-end and expensive but at $18 a bottle its pretty reasonable.  agent_2:I think it definitely is reasonable and with so many wines out there nowadays price is probably no longer an issue.  I mean, the bottle I was telling you about comes from Spain! agent_1:I like to hear some critics reviews on some wines because of the way they describe the taste of the drinks.  agent_2:I know what you mean. They make them sound beautiful and perfect.  I know of one that is described to have the aroma of white flowers and have an appealing waxy texture.  I am not sure how wax can be appealing however. agent_1:It sounds like they ate wax sometime in their lives! There's one I enjoyed hearing that said they 'whack you in the face with an oak two by four'  agent_2:Hahaha! I wonder what that means!  I've heard of one that is described to be racy.  I didn't know wine could be racy. agent_1:For the 14th, I'd definitely recommend a Smith-Madrone chardonnay. Critiques say it wraps you in a lovingly warm blanket.  agent_2:That does sound nice.  Wines sound romantic and such until you learn where you can buy them at.  Some wines are available at a store called the Wine Outlet.   agent_1:It sounds so convenient and easy to decide where to get them from now too. I know they can be ordered online too! agent_2:I've heard that too.  It does make it convenient, especially since so many wines are made all of the world such as In Puglia, Italy. agent_1:All these wines from europe sound and im sure theyre good. I think I'd rather support some from USA though. I know california has a few good ones. 	agent_2:Definitely.

I was surprised there a website for people with couches to crash on, wish I knew it last week I had a long layover. agent_1:Whoa that's awesome! Did you eat crepes? I want to go to Iceland but it sounds like the public transport isn't great-will probably rent a car. agent_2:No crepes, I did have snails which I like. I've had a layover in Iceland, it looks like the moon. Flying it a lot of volcanic lava flows turned to rock. Did you know about that gnome stealing thing, take a picture, then return? That a lot of work. agent_1:Haha yeah I heard about that. Does sound like a lot of work. Did you fly any domestic flights in Iceland? That seems like a good way to get around there. agent_2:No, Iceland Air is cheapest to Sweden, I work there a couple times a year. I'm on the east coast so it's a quick flight though. Do you like fiction, a reader? That how I bide my time. agent_1:Awesome lucky. Yeah fiction is entertaining. I like it because it is not based strictly on history or fact. agent_2:Yes, I'm not much on Science Fiction, more literary fiction. I didn't know Isaac Asimov coined ""robotics"" I have friends who  love him and Sci Fi. What genre do you like? agent_1:Oh nice good genre. I like fiction as well. Edgar Allen Poe's first developed cyborg's in fiction which is pretty cool.  agent_2:Yes and Poe developed the detective genre I read too. I read War and Peace, but the Smash Bros is 4 million words even longer? That would take some time. agent_1:Wow. Is War and Peace good? I know Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction but I have never read his text. agent_2:Yes, I liked it but it's a complex novel. Yes, I read Caesar history of the Gallic Wars. Pretty interesting in light of France now. Do you like music, you see where the highest violin bow price sold for $182,000 wow, that quite expensive per pound. agent_1:You have read a lot I'm impressed. I love music and sometimes classical. Hard to believe a violin sold for that. Hopefully it wasn't the one made out of stone! agent_2:Gold and tortoiseshell i read, I feel sorry for the turtle. You like fiddle or violin more? Country or classic as the instrument is the same. agent_1:Wow. Interesting. I like the fiddle because I prefer country music. A famous scientist who played the violin was Albert Einstein. agent_2:Interesting, complex man. Did you know they have to play and ""break-in"" a violin? That makes sense though interesting it changes the cellulose molecules in the body."	agent_1:Kind of like a shoe? Very interesting.

Not only the composition and history of earth, but also its position relative to other planets in the solar system. agent_1:I agree, so many wonders to think we only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds on a 24 hour calendar of Earth's history. agent_2:What do you mean? agent_1:I mean that if 4.5 billion years of histoy equals 24 hours then humans have only exist for 1 minute and 17 seconds of that 24 hour period, agent_2:Oh wow! That is really neat, time really does fly! I really appreciate these tech billionaire's efforts into space exploration, like Elon Musk and his bold initiative to start colonization in Mars. agent_1:I heard he wants to build a supersonic vertical take off jet.	agent_2:Whatever that is, it just sounds super cool!

You? agent_1:I didn't love poetry either! But I do like individual poems. There's a poem that read normally is sad but becomes inspiring when read backwards. agent_2:That's great! Words can be depressing or uplifting depending on their order. Edgar Allan Poe only received $9 for the publication of ""The Raven."" I wonder if he got royalties."	agent_1:That's surprising! I'm sure he got compensated somehow. I think words can be beautiful when orchestrated properly.

I don't know how they can just create a city out of nowhere and have it ready for 2022, but we'll see what happens agent_1:Yeah I am looking forward to it and yes, I do not know how that is going to work agent_2:I do like the United States and soccer though. They got third place back in 1930 which was the first FIFA World Cup agent_1:Nice, maybe they manage to climb back. you never know. The countries that host it do not have any net economic gains agent_2:Nope I heard about that. That's why I wonder why they're making an entire city for the World Cup. I guess the women's soccer team is better than the men's soccer team in the United States. Is that correct? agent_1:Yup, they seem to do much better. soccer players make more money than other sports combined, well the major ones	agent_2:That is really crazy.

We were at the Krewe of Chewbacchus parade last year. They really nailed his voice, I don't know if they used recordings of wild animals or not, but they were awesome. agent_1:Thats awesome!  Some star wars fans think chewie and r2d2 are rebel agents lol  agent_2:lol.  Of course, that makes a lot of sense, since Chewie and Han are so close. agent_1:I never knew that chewie has a wife and 2 sons!  Hes a family man lol  agent_2:I didn't know that either. Peter Mayhew is an amazing actor, and it was a long time before I realized he played Chewie. agent_1:I never knew him until star wars,  what else has he been in? agent_2:He was in Dark Towers, back in the 80's and he also voices an animated series, I forget which one.  agent_1:Oh I see,  I guess i never seen those.

Did you know George Bush had solar panels put back on the White House? agent_2:yeah, carter put them on, reagan too them off. what about trump? what happened to the panels? agent_1:I'm not sure. They should keep them there. It's good for the environment! I'm surprised Bush was an advocate being an oil fan. agent_2:I think that he did that for PR reasons. i think that it would look bad for an oilman to do that. i would love more solar in the country. agent_1:Teddy Roosevelt was quite the conservationist, as well. He banned Christmas trees from the White House during his day. agent_2:Teddy always went out hunting wild animals. i dont understand his thinking. no trees, but animals, yes? agent_1:Maybe he was only hunting the animals that were overpopulated and bad for the environment? agent_2:Maybe, that is true. i just thought that he would want to leave the animals alone. He was behind the national parks too. great guy for conservation. agent_1:Yeah, but there are some animals that can become a problem if they aren't hunted, unfortunately. Just the circle of life.  agent_2:True. Maybe he was looking to maintain a balance. The white house still uses floppy disks in part for storing files.

Have you heard of the game Send me to heaven? agent_1:I have , that is the game where people throw their phones as high as they can agent_2:Yeah and that is why Apple had to get in between and ban the game. Pretty stupid one agent_1:Yeah agree. When the iPhone came out Jobs has to have identical ones with him as they kept crashing during the reveal agent_2:Yeah that is pretty cool.

I think the ice packs have been shrinking in recent years. agent_2:Yes sadly. Just like the fact Earth will be helium free in the near future agent_1:Sad indeed.  Another sad fact is more than 80% of the Earth's natural forests have already been destroyed. agent_2:We have changed the earth so much in our short time. But did you know that if earths history were a 24 hour period we would only account for 1:17 mins agent_1:That makes me feel like a tiny ant. lol  When Earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long. agent_2:I wish work days would go by that fast!

It hasn't been more than 62.8 percent in 100 years agent_2:the vote should be mandatory. then people would see the power of the ballot. agent_1:I agree, I am sure other countries do that. I don't think we should go back to how ancient athens did it, do you know how? agent_2:i think they used a lottery. that would help avoid power falling into certain hands consistenly. agent_1:yea and hoping the lottery would not allow an oligarchy.

The special branch of science to study animals is called zoology. agent_2:Its amazing how there are more than 7 million species of animals and there are more to discover. agent_1:There are about 20 quintillion animals on planet earth. agent_2:Wow, that is a lof animals for sure, you know that animals have constitutional rights in Germany? agent_1:In 1912 Scottish protection of animals act, the loch ness monster is a protected species. agent_2:Really? I though the Loch Ness monster was a myth, or maybe its a  safety measure in case they actually discover the monster.	agent_1:Alaska has had a cat named stubbs as its mayor since 1997.	agent_2 likes pets. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['pets', 'travel', 'favorite place'].
6472	agent_1:Hi, how are you? agent_2:Good! Did you know Kristen Stewart from the Twilight movies helped author a paper about AI? Not just a pretty face! agent_1:Wow, I had no idea! That's pretty cool. Isn't that one lady from Bri bang also like a pHd? agent_2:I'm not sure but wouldn't doubt it. Facebook is developing AI designed to better understand emotions, identify objects, and predict user actions. Yikes.  agent_1:Clifford seems to be a great way to augment teaching. I would like to see a pre and post test with a control group to see how well the AI works. agent_2:Interesting. At Stanford they use Google Hangouts to teach AI more effectively.  agent_1:That's interesting. I teach college courses and would love to see how that works. I wonder if the non-for-profit has more info on it. agent_2:Good question. How about this one -- there's a NASA scientist who believes our world is just a computer generated VR. Maybe he's been watching too much of The Matrix.  agent_1:That's nuts. I sometimes wonder if the ultra-intelligent need things to maintain their sanity... agent_2:Haha. Definitely. Overthinking can be a torture, I'm sure. The first Virtual Reality game was created in 1968. How far we've come!	agent_1:I would love to go on Lockheed Martin's virtual reality tour of mars. seems like it would be a lot of fun.	agent_2 likes travel. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['travel', 'TV show', 'TV show'].
12045	"agent_1:Do you have hope for Pelosi and the democrats in providing balance to the government at this all important time in history. agent_2:I am not very into politics. The modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson. agent_1:Pelosi is the new Speaker of the House. She was not very welcomed in Florida a couple of months back when she was in Florida campaigning for the democrat candidate. agent_2:Why not? Anything in particular? agent_1:She is just not well liked because of her brash personality I presume. agent_2:I see. Did you know There hasn't been a us president who wasn't a republican or a democrat since 1853? agent_1:No, but I would have ventured a similar guess. To add to your point, the colors of blue and red have been used to differentiate the parties since 2000 agent_2:I thought it was longer than that! Every us president with a beard has been a republican. agent_1:Yeah, that was a weird fact. Another similar one would be the fact that Truman refused to be photographed on a ride at Disneyland. agent_2:I heard it was because it was the dumbo ride and so he wouldn't be associated with republicans agent_1:Silly.  We need another tough progressive like Teddy Roosevelt. agent_2:The last time a republican was elected president without a nixon or bush on the ticket was 1928! agent_1:That is quite some time. There are very few conservative democrats left in office. agent_2:The GOP presently hold ""trifectas"" (the executive branch and both chambers of the legislative branch) in a majority of states (26/50), and a ""trifecta plus"" (executive, legislative, and judicial branches) at the federal level, as five of the nine current Supreme Court justices were appointed by Republican presidents. agent_1:I think that might be higher with the confirmation of Kavanaugh recently.  agent_2:Likely! Here's a funny fact; Fox news threatened to sue the simpsons in order to stop them from parodying its famously anti-democratic party agenda. agent_1:Sounds just like fox.  Do you know the republicans actually started out opposing slavery."	agent_2:I didn't realize that, no. 	agent_1 dislikes TV show. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV show', 'theme park', 'no'].
4626	agent_1:Hello, do you follow the government? agent_2:A little bit, they own almost all of Nevada.  agent_1:Yep, they own 86% of the state which is crazy. agent_2:They did test a lot of nuclear bombs there, so I don't think anyone would want those areas.  agent_1:Very good point. Did you know Wikileaks published the government's plan to shutdown Wikileaks? agent_2:No, but it is seems logical given the nature of government and Wikileak's nature to publish them.   agent_1:True. A man in France once impersonated a government official and was able to sell the Eiffel Tower twice.  agent_2:Yeah, I feel a little bad for the people that fell for it, especially the first one, he was so ashamed that he did not called to police.  agent_1:Me too. The Norwegian government once gave $1 billion to help save the Amazon rainforest.  agent_2:Do you think they will succeed ? I hope so.  agent_1:I hope so too. Do you know much about Einstein? agent_2:I know he was a scientist. Is he German ? agent_1:Yep, he was German. He was once asked to be the president of Israel.  agent_2:Why would they ask him to be president of Israel ? He must have made a ton of money with all those posters with his face.  agent_1:Not really sure. I also saw he was a member of the NAACP. agent_2:So he was actively for civics right, he seems a good man but a quirky one I have heard that he wrote something and put it is a time capsule that will be opened in 6939.   agent_1:He was a good man and very smart. That's cool about the time capsule. Did you know he would charge $1 for his autograph? agent_2:That is a lot for the time, what did he do with the money ?	agent_1:Not really sure lol.

I would prefer to watch the highlights and get the gist. agent_1:Yeah, they are better to attend in person. Or I should say they used to be better until they jacked the price of a beer up to $12.  agent_2:I do not buy anything at games. i get loaded up before and then partake after. during the game, no. agent_1:That's probably a good idea.

How about you? agent_1:I love the information, but everything these days is so slanted from both sides sometimes it is hard to get. agent_2:Right there is not one source out there that you can trust. I hate the news outlets, but still need to see what's going on. agent_1:Much agreed.  I find that the truth lies somewhere in the middle.  The media tries to create outrage for their ratings. agent_2:Exactly. That's why I watch both CNN and Fox. It kind of helps me to sort through the muck.	agent_1:Fox is watched more than Cnn and MSNBC combined.

9873	agent_1:Hi - do you like Netflix? agent_2:I do like Netflix but not as much as I use to. It doesn't seem like they have been adding new shows lately agent_1:I used to like it better also. I only use it because we get it for free with T Mobile. agent_2:Are you a big fan of Star Wars? agent_1:I'm not a huge fan. What about you? agent_2:No not really. I tried to watch a couple of the movies but I couldn't get into them like some people do. agent_1:Did you know Netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth usage in North America from 9pm-12am? agent_2:I didn't know that but it doesn't surprise me. I guess its pretty popular around the world. agent_1:I guess so. Netflix and YouTube make up half the peak internet traffic in North America. agent_2:I watch more youtube than I do Netflix. Which do you prefer? agent_1:I prefer YouTube as well. Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth agent_2:I think Neflix is over rated these days. It use to be pretty neat being able to stream movies. But then the cost went up and its not as awesome. Youtube is free and I can find lots more videos on random stuff. agent_1:I agree. Netflix is worth $2 billion though so they must be doing something right. agent_2:That is true. Do you like the movie Transformers? agent_1:I have never seen it, but I like Megan Fox.

4030	"agent_1:Hello, how do you do? agent_2:hello, I'm alright!  Have you seen the new Christopher Robin movie?  I heard it was really for the whole family.  I remember seeing the trailer where Pooh goes, ""They say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing every day!"" I thought that line was funny. agent_1:I thought it was a clever adaptation of a classic that help the now older audience reconnect and relate in order to reconnect to their youth, perhaps having imaginary pals of their own agent_2:Hmm.. sometimes I think all my pals are imaginary.  Sadly, I'm told the REAL Christopher Robin (who the books were based on) hated them and never took any money from them.  I find that sad, since his father wrote the books for him.. agent_1:That is a shame. I wonder why the real chris hated them. Perhaps he wanted a father to be there for him rather than children books agent_2:I think maybe he felt embarrassed because the books were based so heavily on his life.  Did you know he died on Easter in 1996?  That was one year after I graduated from high school.  Man, I feel old!  LOL agent_1:Well I hope he at least found some solace in that it inspired and that it is a indispensable part of many children worldwide agent_2:Yeah, hopefully.  Anyway, like I said, I haven't seen it, I think I'll check and see if my library has it though.  I would get it from Netflix, but I don't have a subscription at the moment.  Are you on Netflix?  It's pretty awesome! They've got like 137 million subscribers worldwide. agent_1:While I understand their business model and why people use it, I never got it. It is impressive nonetheless that they account for 33% of all bandwith in north america during peak hours agent_2:Yeah, I've heard they're especially busy in the late hours.  Get this, they have an hour long movie that's nothing but a roaring fireplace!  I think people play it a lot during the holidays or winter months to give their living rooms (or whatever) a decorative look. agent_1:I think that that is surprisingly practical for the ambiance. I bet blockbuster's ghost regrets not buying netflix agent_2:Ha, yeah!  I'm told they laughed the Netflix people out of the office when they made an offer to them.  They regret that decision for sure!   agent_1:I mean if I could pay 50million today for 2 billion in a few years wow what an investment agent_2:Get this, Netflix has people on it's staff who's job is to watch the shows and tag the content (guessing with genre tags and stuff.)  Get PAID to watch Netflix?  Where do I sign up for that?  LOL agent_1:That does sound nice. I wonder if they will start outsourcing to us turkers? agent_2:Ha, we could only hope!  Course, if I had Netflix it wouldn't be just for the movies and tv shows, I think I'd try some of their original programming as well.  For instance, I heard the show ""Stranger Things"" was really good. Have you seen that one?   agent_1:I have not, but I have heard good things about their original content lately. agent_2:Course, there's so many subscription services it's getting ridiculous.  Hulu, Amazon, Netflix, heck even Disney is coming out (or has it already?) with one for all their movies and properties.   agent_1:Well I mean they have to at least match up to their competitors so it is understandable. All that is left for consumers is to see who provides the best service agent_2:Yeah, but it must suck if several of them offer exclusively shows/movies that you REALLY to see.  When it was all just Netflix, you pretty much could get whatever you wanted... Did you know Disney makes $1,110 per SECOND?  Wow... that blows my mind."	agent_1:That is amazing.

Did you know the indian government put a poll in a forested area full of lions for a single voter? agent_2:I guess the gov't needs to make sure everyone has a chance to vote. The US is different. The voter turnout for presidential elections hasn't exceeded 62.8% in the last 100 years agent_1:I cannot believe more people do not get out and vote, teally agent_2:They probably feel that their options are poor. Except in Nevada.Nevada is the only state to have the ""none of these candidates"" voting option for presidential elections agent_1:I like to have that option really. Did you know astronauts vote from space? agent_2:I figure they have the right. I wonder what percentage of astronauts actually vote. agent_1:Maybe all of them I hope. even in uk not al men had the right to vote until 1918 agent_2:Maybe you needed to own land, or have a title or something. I wonder if the same rules applied to women. agent_1:I am not sure, but glad we all get to vote now. Did you know in atlanta 34% of the black male population cannot vote? agent_2:That sounds like the South.

Did You see a movie about him ? I've heard it's good. agent_2:No, I haven't seen it but watched his show growing up. agent_1:I'm from Poland and I got here like 16 years ago... I've never seen it but I admire who he is and what he did... agent_2:That's cool.  I've never been to Poland.  There are ballet slippers that make drawings from the dancer's movements agent_1:Probably looks like a 2year old drawing :) agent_2:Probably, the first moonwalk ever recorded was performed by tap dancer bill bailey in 1955! agent_1:...so it's not MJ who invented it ? agent_2:I guess not.  He must have taken it and run with it though....and screamed also agent_1:lol ;) but that walk got famous just because Michael ;)  agent_2:Absolutely it did.  That dude could dance. agent_1:Yes he did ! and sing ;)  ...and I don't believe to all that nasty stuff they were saying about him...  agent_2:There has been some rough stuff said about him for sure. agent_1:yes... but once he paid... everything was fine... sorry, if something happened to my child, no money in the world would make it fine... that's why I don't believe in that...	agent_2:Money makes people crazy seems like.

All that money invested and what return yet agent_1:I heard the Nationals might trade Bryce Harper, maybe Houston should have tried to get him instead agent_2:They might need him agent_1:He's good but not as good as Aaron Judge though agent_2:Hopefully Aaron Judge will not be out for more than 3 weeks agent_1:Yea, he's the face of the franchise now since Jeter left agent_2:Did you know the Yankees had been the Highlanders?"	agent_1:Yea I read about that a long time ago, I didn't remember them starting off as the Baltimore Orioles though	agent_2 likes sports. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'baseball', 'Astros'].

I want to go to Iceland but it sounds like the public transport isn't great-will probably rent a car. agent_2:No crepes, I did have snails which I like. I've had a layover in Iceland, it looks like the moon. Flying it a lot of volcanic lava flows turned to rock. Did you know about that gnome stealing thing, take a picture, then return? That a lot of work. agent_1:Haha yeah I heard about that. Does sound like a lot of work. Did you fly any domestic flights in Iceland?

Do you like fiction, a reader? That how I bide my time. agent_1:Awesome lucky. Yeah fiction is entertaining. I like it because it is not based strictly on history or fact. agent_2:Yes, I'm not much on Science Fiction, more literary fiction. I didn't know Isaac Asimov coined ""robotics"" I have friends who  love him and Sci Fi. What genre do you like? agent_1:Oh nice good genre. I like fiction as well.

There is a fish called the black swallower that is capable of eating prey twice its length and 10 times its own weight. agent_2:I knew one of those in my fraternity in college I think. I was shocked to learn there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.

Creatures of the great deep are extraordinary. ""The immortal Jelly fish.  agent_2:I already looked up that jellyfish on my phone. Fascinating, yes loch ness is protected and pets in Boulder, Colorado are not owned, but guarded.

The universe is certainly fascinating. agent_2:It is indeed, have you ever observed Mars in the sky ? NASA wants to send people there in 20-25 years.  agent_1:I have a few times, but never by telescope or anything like that.  I have heard that a colonization project was planned for 2023 and was going to be funded by making some sort of reality show.

I would love to see humans make it to mars in my life time.  I wonder if the first country there would try to claim it as their territory. agent_2:I don't think they will claim to Mars, it will be more like the Moon, even Antarctica does not belong to a country.   agent_1:True.  It is also crazy that a satellite was lost on Mars because Locheed Martin used the imperial system but NASA used metric.  How could they not get that detail in order? agent_2:Locheed is a big company based in the US. The Imperial system is still used there, maybe they had an European subcontractor and units got mixed up.   agent_1:Very possible. I think it is neat that the planets are named after Roman Gods and Goddesses.  With Mars being the God of War   agent_2:It has a reddish tone, it is the most war-like planet. It is crazy that some of Earth's bacteria could live on Mars.   agent_1:That gives promise that Mars could become sustainable for earth life.   agent_2:Would you go live on Mars ? - 81 °F is too cold for me.  agent_1:Id seriously have to bundle up.  I live in Florida, so it gets in the 20s here and I start to freeze.   agent_2:Maybe it is something that will have all have to do, Earth has already lost 80 % of its natural forest.  agent_1:It is amazing that in humans short period on earth we have done so much damage to the natural resources on the planet.  I mean if earths entire history was put in to one 24 hour period, humans have only been here less than two minutes. agent_2:But humans have a big impacts on Earth'S ressources, at this rate there won't be any Helium left at the end of the 21st century.  agent_1:That's crazy, I cant believe that people aren't actively trying to stop some of this, or those that do are met with such opposition.  I mean if there is a UN ambassador to extraterrestrial life we can certainly advocate for saving this planet. agent_2:I wonder if they choose someone serious, or the most incompetent guy in the UN since he won't probably won't ever have any real responsibilities.  agent_1:That's a good question, never thought about that.  How would you exactly explain your job seriously to people, yeah, I'm just here in case aliens ever contact us.   agent_2:And would you consider it as a promotion ? It does not look good in a résumé, unless your are a comedian.  agent_1:Very true, I could see someone trying to either explain that job or a gap in employment because they were too embarrassed to report that as a job.  	agent_2:Maybe, you could get promoted and be Earth's ambassador on Mars ?

They speculate it's tied into their ability to mimic. agent_1:Wow, I guess everything with a heartbeat probably feels some impulse to dance. More advanced forms of dance have aesthetic and symbolic value.  agent_2:Did you know Emilia Clarke did the funky chicken and robot dance to audition for Game of Thrones? agent_1:LOL, no.

I think the album is actually called Man in the Woods. I don't think it was as good as his earlier stuff. I only really remember Say Something from this new album. agent_1:Yeah. Well I think it's safe to say he has come a long way since Mickey Mouse Club! agent_2:Have you seen any of the movies he's been in? agent_1:Yeah I saw the one about facebook which I thought was good. He is a good actor but I think he should stick to pop music. Ricky Gervais was a pop singer oddly enough. agent_2:I can't remember the name of the movie I saw him but Cameron Diaz and Jason Segal were in it too. It was pretty good. I can't imagine Ricky Gervais singing at all! He's hilarious though. agent_1:Oh yeah I remember that movie too. Like a rom-com. Yes he is. I want to look up his video lol.

My favorite of all time is Deadpool though. agent_1:Oh, I love that character! But surprisingly even with how not good it was, Wonder Woman managed to be the highest grossing superhero movie! agent_2:Wow, even higher than all the Batmans? agent_1:Yes, and it's even considered a WWI movie, I wonder why though. Perhaps its because the actress, Gal Gadot, served two years as a soldier in the Israel Defense Forces? agent_2:That is cool that she served.  She seems to be a good role model for young girls. agent_1:She really does. It's not a superhero thing, but Earth will be helium-free by the end of the 21st century, I wonder what kind of impact that would bring, do you know? agent_2:I am not sure, it is probably something I should know.  Humans have done a lot of damage to the planet. agent_1:Yeah I agree, especially when the FDA burns through six tons of literature in an act of US censorhip agent_2:That is so wasteful.  Did you know winston chruchills prize was in Literature, not peace? agent_1:Oh really? Did he publish something to warrant the prize? agent_2:I think he did.  Dont know what though. agent_1:There's an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with worst possible opening sentences to novels, I wonder why, any guesses? agent_2:I think there is a contest for that.

Do you follow the republican party? agent_1:yes, every president with a beard has been a republican:) agent_2:not sure how accurate that is, Trump does not have a beard agent_1:just meant the ones that have had a beard, it seems like red and blue has been used forever for rep & dems but did you know it only started in 2000? agent_2:I understand.  I thought the red and blue would have started earlier.  I feel like I have seen it forever. agent_1:same, also only dem or rep president since 1853, time for an independent? agent_2:I agree with that, they have least funding though agent_1:true, hows this for voting, Indian govt set up poll in a forest with lions agent_2:that is crazy agent_1:they had one voter, talk about restricting the votes agent_2:Hardly feels like a majority.  Do you follow the Senate? agent_1:not so much, i like the idea of the candy desk where they keep a drawer of candy for the senators though agent_2:I love that idea.  As well as women staging a protest for pants suits. agent_1:yes, hard to believe they could not wear pants until 1993! agent_2:Craziness.

Ken Jeong, the comedian is actually a licensed physician and even saved someone who had a seizure during his shows! agent_2:Oh wow he is a real doctor? I thought that was just a bit for tv.  agent_1:He actually went to medical school and did residency to become licensed, but I'm guessing he makes way more as a famous comedian than as a physician, what do you think? agent_2:That is crazy to think we live in a society where being famous can pay more than people whos job it is to save lives.  agent_1:Yeah, like I remember reading that the actor who plays Dr. House gets paid more than $700K per episode!

Pretty sneaky.  agent_2:I suppose, do you play video games on consoles like the PlayStation? agent_1:I used to play video games a lot as a kid. Don't play now. No time. Little interest. Do you like to play? agent_2:No, but the US department of defense used over a thousand of those consoles to build a supercomputer because it was cheaper than the alternative! That sounds like massive processing power! agent_1:That's a smart way to go. Scale up simple units to get the power. I don't really know the PS. Aren't they up to PS4 or something? agent_2:Not sure since I don't play as well either, all I know is that it is created and owned by Sony who launched it in Japan. They were so popular and successful that they've sold at least over 100 million units! Wonder what X-box's numbers are. agent_1:Sony has made a great platform. Are the games good? Usually that drives the sales of the machine. Are the games on all the platforms now? agent_2:Not sure since those consoles can be used for research purposes, like researchers are using them to research black holes, maybe they are not only used for games. agent_1:I did hear that the military used the controllers for training troops on equipment. Very intuitive. They learned fast. I don't know why black holes for research though. Why not regular computers? agent_2:Probably since it was cheaper like the supercomputer they built out of the consoles. I wonder if I went on YouTube whether or not I could learn how to build a supercomputer as well. Do you use YouTube? agent_1:That's true. Cheaper. I sometimes use Youtube, usually for music. agent_2:I do the same for those purposes as well and for DIY videos which I think is a large reason why its the second largest search engine on the net! agent_1:DIY videos? Sounds interesting. Why is Justin Bieber's ""baby"" is the most disliked video on youtube? Why the hate? I don't like the guy, but what's the point? agent_2:Yeah exactly, like Facebook, they should probably take away that dislike button and spread a little bit more positivity! Unless it's because his die-hard fans are sad that he isn't a ""Baby"" anymore. fans do get crazy sometimes. agent_1:I'm not really up to speed on the new music. I guess I'm getting old.

It was first held in 1903 agent_1:Wow so more than a hundred years since the first game. Did you like Babe Ruth? agent_2:I mean, I never saw him play live, but I do think he is one of the best ever.He helped make the Yankees a powerhouse  agent_1:Yeah event the bests make mistakes he cost his team the title back in 1926 agent_2:Yes, Babe tried to steal second base and it did not work out well agent_1:No it didn't work well at all. The Cubs were the first team to win the WS back to back, I guess that didnt work for them either agent_2:And that was the last time they won until 2016.  Quite the long layoff agent_1:Yeah, it seems like the team had a real curse on top of them, the Woman's World Cup had a higher rating that the World Series.  agent_2:Well the World Cup does just come around every four years, so I can see how it would be popular on TV agent_1:I guess that makes sense still World Series is really popular in the states and woman's soccer team arent as popular.  agent_2:Well baseball is not as popular as it was back in the day.

We like to grill a lot outside, which helps not make our home more hot. agent_2:Grilling out is the best to help with the heat inside the house. If I have to cook in the house i do it early in the morning before it gets too hot. agent_1:Yes that's another great idea. We also sometimes eat out if it is way too hot, or eating something like salads or cereal. Where we aren't using heat at all. agent_2:That is a great idea. We tend to eat leftovers too and just use the micorwave. agent_1:The microwave is great and fast, I agree. Making Icecream is a great way to cool down when it gets too hot. We also tend to use box fans. agent_2:We use a fan for sure. Also started using like a slow cooker or toaster oven not as hot and now can fit up to a whole chicken. agent_1:Great appliances help to cook! We love our air-fryer.

Drew Goddard directed it as well! agent_2:A B movie? Great! that sounds fun. low budget? doesnt take itself too seriously? agent_1:Exactly. So are you a horror fan in general? I watch horror films as a workout because you can burn over 180 calories just by watching them, surprisingly enough! agent_2:I thnk the first time it would burn that many, but the second time maybe not. not so scary.  agent_1:That is a good point. But you know what else is crazy, they say if you view abstract art after watching a horror film, you'll enjoy it a lot more! I need to try that! agent_2:How does that even work? is your brain more active? more emotionally sensitive? agent_1:I would imagine so. It's so weird, isn't it? I tell you what else is weird, Stephen King once said Bambi was the first horror movie he watched. Can you believe that? He definitely has a twisted mind, doesn't he? agent_2:He probably was traumatized by that disney flick and ended up fascinated with the macabre. agent_1:Agreed! You know what else gets me?

I don't get most of the 10,000 living species of them in my yard, but do enjoy watching the ones that I do have. agent_1:Ah, yes, nothing like a feathered, toothless endothermic vertebrate to warm the cockles of ones heart... and occasionally adorn the dinner plate!  agent_2:Ha, for sure!  I actually have a bird feeder and pond in my back yard that attracts them quite often.  Even get some hummingbirds during warmer weather.  It's kinda neat that they steal spiderwebs to repair their nests. agent_1:Ingenious little tweeters!  Except perhaps for the Dodo bird, a less-than-successful member of the pigeon family. agent_2:I didn't know they were from the pigeon family.  i wonder if they were trying to fly without sleeping like some birds do.when migrating and couldn't figure it out.  Sounds difficult to me. agent_1:Yeah, but birds can do a number of curiously difficult tasks, such as mimicking the sounds of cameras, car alarms, and even chainsaws! Now that is difficult! agent_2:I actually heard that.  I think some birds in Australia can pull that off.  Quite skillful if you ask me. agent_1:I'll say!  Try flying sometime!  You know, in most birds, their bones are soo lightweight, they weigh less than the feathers, which is one of the reasons they do not plumment to the ground while in flight... agent_2:Right, they are lightweight because their bones are hollow.  I wonder if that makes them more prone to breaking? agent_1:I would think so. Except perhaps the extinct elephant birds. Their name, and the fact that they were featherless, suggest that they were not petite little hummingbirds.  agent_2:I wonder how big they were?  Possibly even larger than today's 9 foot tall ostrich. agent_1:Impressive!  So, if birds can learn to mimic chainsaws, I wonder if they can learn to rap?  I would love to hear a cockatiel freestyle a compliment battle with some Korean rappers! agent_2:Oh my, so would I!  If they could do that then i bet their music would make it into the Library of Congress right along with Tupac Shakur. agent_1:For certain! ""Who let the birds out? Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet!"" Now that would be culturally significant! agent_2:That almost sounds like a rapping bird could be a cartoon character.  I wonder if Eminem would have drawn him considering he used to want to becaome a comic book artist. agent_1:Nice! Shall we name him ""Dr Dodo""... or maybe ""Fowl Ice T"" ? agent_2:I like ""Dr. Dodo"".  He could do freestyle complimentary rapping like they do in Korea. agent_1:Then Dr Dodo could defend Emminem in court while appearing with that rapping judge in Michigan! agent_2:That would be hysterical!

They can be anywhere between 2 inches or 9 feet! agent_1:I think it's incredible how easily they can fly.  It's probably because their bones are so hollow that the entire skeleton weighs less than the feathers! agent_2:Probably! Did you know one of the smallest birds, a hummingbird, will actually steal spider webs construct and repair their nests? agent_1:That's funny!  There are wild birds in Australia that can mimic the sound of cameras, car alarms, and chainsaws. That could get noisey! agent_2:Wow. I wonder if they're in the parrot family or if other birds outside of the parrot family can mimic sounds like that? agent_1:That's a good possibility!  The extinct dodo bird is actually a sub family of pigeon.  Interesting. agent_2:That is interesting! Can you believe there are some birds that will migrate all the way from Alaska to Mexico without sleeping? agent_1:That's pretty incredible!  Do you like to dance? agent_2:Only if I've had a couple of drinks, but I respect the art form absolutely. How about you? agent_1:I can't dance but wish I could.  Tupac danced ballet in high school and ended up portraying the mouse king in the Nutcracker!	agent_2:That's pretty impressive! Bruce Lee was also evidently a pretty good dancer.

Did you know that it evolved from a game in England? agent_1:I do like the game, yeah, and no I didnt know that, I wonder why its not popular in England then agent_2:I don't know.  Baseball is a form of an old bat and ball game played there back in the mid-18th century.  It's weird that it's popular in the US and especially Japan and not there. agent_1:It is odd, maybe as odd as the managers wearing uniforms in the field,  agent_2:I've always wondered why they do that.  I assume it's to show team membership but I don't really know. agent_1:Its because they can also play if they think its the best thing, if the need arises they can step into th field, did you hear about that man that found 3 million dollars worth of cards in his attic agent_2:So a manager can play?  I didn't know that.  If we are talking about the same man he found old baseball cards, right?	agent_1:Yeah he found card that belonged to his grand father, they were just hidden in the attic, crazy luck right!	agent_2 likes hobby. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['hobby', 'sports', 'Japan'].

I like to play Bob Ross' Joy of Painting for my dogs while I'm at work, and YouTube has full episodes of it. agent_1:Yeah I like him too. You Tube is the second largets search engine nowadays agent_2:I'm not surprise. At one point, it consumed as much bandwidth as the entire internet in 2000. agent_1:Yeah that is crazy. Bieber's Baby song seems to be the most disliked video in there. Poor guy agent_2:I don't feel as badly for him as I do for the three guys who created YouTube. Evidently, Google bought it for only 1.65 billion dollars over a decade ago. I feel like it's probably worth way more now! agent_1:I bet it is for sure. Have you heard of Bluetube? agent_2:I haven't. What is BlueTube? agent_1:It is a police YouTube and you can check out law enforcement videos in it agent_2:That's pretty cool. I remember when YouTube was completely free, and was mostly cute animals. agent_1:Yeah the good times. Did you know they had to increase the video view after Gangnam Style came out? agent_2:That's crazy. I wonder how many views the very first upload has by new. That one with the guy talking about an elephant. agent_1:Yeah I wonder about that too. On another topic, do you follow politics much? agent_2:I do. I love politics. There are a lot of fun facts about the government I find fascinating. Like the congressional baseball game that has been going on for over a hundred years? They should televise that! agent_1:I would love to see that. Did you know Truman refused to be photographed on the dumbo ride? agent_2:Haha, yeah. He didn't want to be associated with the Republican party. I guess Hillary didn't, either, since she used to be the President of the Young Republicans club in school. agent_1:THat is such a huge change for her, wow. Did you know every republican president has had a beard? agent_2:Yeah, Hillary wasn't the only one to change her mind; Reagan was originally a Democrat! I don't think Donald Trump has a beard, but I think every president who has had a beard was a Republican. 	agent_1:Yeah I was thinking about that, maybe he decided to change that.

Did you know Jon stewart was a skilled soccer player in college and represented the us at the pan american maccabi games in brazil in 1983. agent_2:I do not follow soccer, I do remember reading about the German player who donated his bonus so 23 kids could have surgery. agent_1:Wow so generous!  thats amazing! Americans call it ""soccer"" because it was slang for association football agent_2:I find it fascinating that they used to dry the tennis couts for the 69' US Open with helicopters.

I adore that film!  agent_1:The tasting menu at Sushi Nakazawa? How many times have you gone? agent_2:Yes that's the one! I have went twice. Once on a date and the other for a work dinner with my client. Every course is a surprise, there isn't actually any menus!	agent_1:You've got to be a real foodie to take a risk like that!

Kardashian can't have babies ? agent_1:Not sure to be honest, I'd love to know too though.	agent_2:I think it's just another thing to do to be on the cover of the magazine and have plenty of interviews...  this is a crazy world... 	agent_1 dislikes entertainment. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['entertainment', 'family', 'sperm donor'].

Supposedly she is the youngest self made billionaire ever. agent_2:Yeah I do not know anything about her.  Did you know there was a dwarf planet between Mars and Jupiter?  I had never heard of it agent_1:Kylie Jenner is one of the Kardashians, I believe. I never knew about the dwarf planet between Mars and Jupiter!

I love seeing the pictures sent back from Curiosity on Mars - its so sweet it sings happy birthday to itself agent_1:Those rovers are freaking adorable. I have ever thought so. agent_2:Yes.  I thought it was awesome that they used aluminum from the world trade centers on spirit and opportunity agent_1:It's sad that a satellite was lost on Mars due to a technicality. agent_2:Yes.    for sure.

They were just bragging today about ""shoes""  apparently they go on feet to comfort and protect them.  Bunch of snobs, I think. agent_2:I remember wanting the trendier clothes my friends wore, and once or twice getting made fun of for wearing hand me downs. agent_1:I hear ya there.  One of my friends is wanting to do a clothing line for fish.  I keep telling her that fresh water fish drink through their skin via osmosis. agent_2:That sounds more complicated than my aunt buying clothes for her dog! Some fish drink water via their mouths, but the ones that soak it in through their skin would need clothes that wouldn't block that. agent_1:This is so true.  I think that's why I like Jack Purcell canvas shoes.  The dog never gets them dirty when we go for a walk. agent_2:I wonder if dogs ever get ""jealous"" of other dogs with clothes. Can dogs even make fun of each other like kids or adults sometimes do? agent_1:I'm sure they do.  If crows understand economics, trade and barter, then dogs pretty much have to understand jealousy. agent_2:Hopefully that won't lead to anything like the coat ban in some schools to try to stop kids from teasing others for their clothing quality. Can you imagine being banned from the dog park because your dog's Jack Purcells are too nice? agent_1:You have a good point, but my dog only wears Patagonia, so I'm not too worried. agent_2:I didn't know Patagonia made dog clothes too! They have really nice human coats (that's funny to write), and they're usually less expensive than some designer brands. Some of those get up to $955 or more! agent_1:I know!  Moncler coats cost more than my first car did.   agent_2:I don't think I've ever spent more than $40 on a coat, but I have a hard time not being cheap about clothes, plus I live in the desert where I don't need them much! I've never bought anything like a Moncler. agent_1:Poverty Shaming seems like it would take so much energy.   You always have to try and be original or it just starts to turn into a meme agent_2:It's really sad how petty or troubled of a person you have to be to do it too. People put down others because they haven't learned to pick themselves up any other way, and it's indicative of deeper problems. agent_1:Oh totally!  They would be better off spending their time buying clothes for their dog. agent_2:Maybe people should be more like dogs sometimes. Dogs aren't going to make fun of other dogs for not having smartphones or nice coats like people do. agent_1:You do make a really valid point, but dogs also eat burritos off the ground, so it's a trade off really. agent_2:On the other hand, dogs don't waste food that way!

Can seem to protect things that we need to survive. And we've been here just a short time. agent_1:thats true, if history were a 24 hour day, humans have only taken up about 1 minute of time agent_2:The day has been getting longer. It was only 5.5 hours. Soon it'll be so long that we'll have a 20-hour workday. I bet people will want more vacation.  agent_1:that is wacky, will the day continue to get longer? like a 40 hour day at somepoint? agent_2:Maybe in billions of years. Humanity will be long gone, having cut down all the forests and filled the oceans with plastic. agent_1:ya that is sad to think about, also sad we'll have run out of helium by the year 2100 agent_2:We'll get our helium from fusion reactors.

The cat owner states that her fiance has to get rid of his saltwater fish if she gets rid of her cat.  That's not necessarily fair though I don't think.  They seem like they may struggle as a couple in the future. agent_2:Yeah that's a bit dramatic! A cat lover is known as an ailurophile and a dog lover is known as a cynophile. agent_1:Allergies can be serious to people.  I understand his reserve of having a cat. agent_2:Me too. A pet or companion animal is an animal kept primarily for a person's company, protection, or entertainment. No one should have to be made uncomfortable by a pet in the house. agent_1:I'm sure she loves the pet, but she has to make a choice if the pet is harming her fiance. agent_2:Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described.

It was kind of his fault. agent_2:And I guess the species is endangered, which is part of why it's a big deal agent_1:Yes.  40 cops tried to stop the crowd, but it turned into a mob of 600 villagers. agent_2:Most of the time they try to remove the animals humanely, but those cases are also in the United States. Those villagers likely acted out of fear agent_1:Yes, in some instances animals that attack are required to be put down and tested for disease like rabies agent_2:On the other end of the spectrum, animals have guaranteed legal rights in Germany agent_1:That is good.  There is a line between public safety and animal cruelty agent_2:As long as the public is safe. In Scotland, the Loch Ness monster is a protected species agent_1:That is funny.

Then about 240 thousand years ago we lost body hair agent_2:One thing we didn't lose are hiccups. It's a leftover result of when land animals had both lungs and gills agent_1:That is insane to think how species evolved.

True.  New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation.

But surprisingly even with how not good it was, Wonder Woman managed to be the highest grossing superhero movie! agent_2:Wow, even higher than all the Batmans? agent_1:Yes, and it's even considered a WWI movie, I wonder why though. Perhaps its because the actress, Gal Gadot, served two years as a soldier in the Israel Defense Forces? agent_2:That is cool that she served.

Do you? agent_1:Don't have a favorite team either but my friends are huge Red Sox fans not sure if it's because they have gone on to win nine world series championships or what but with those stats, seems like a great accomplishment. agent_2:Well they have an amazing performance. Did you know Lebron James partly own the boston red sox? agent_1:Oh really? I didn't know that, that must be a great investment! Lots of fans have superstitions surrounding games, do you have any?  agent_2:Indeed. Do you like the mlb? agent_1:Not really, the only player I'm familiar with is Babe Ruth who was caught stealing to end the game and lose the world series in 1926. agent_2:Well it has its pros and cons. After a 17yr old female pitcher struck out babe ruth and lou gehrig, she was banned from pro baseball	agent_1:I wonder how that banning action would fare in today's world and society, you think it would receive negative press?	agent_2 dislikes politics. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'sports', 'basketball team'].

I used to play a lot of them but the more recent ones havent been great agent_1:Some of the older ones. I can't remember the names off the top of my head but one was a race game, where you raced in ships on different planets/tracks. agent_2:oh probably the Episode 1 podracer game. that was a goood one. I cant believe how successful its become after George Lucas made that one movie way back in the 70s agent_1:I know.  Hey, did you know that his wife worked on the movie too?  She even won an academy award. agent_2:she did?? what for? agent_1:She did some editing work on some scenes.

I don't think I asked, but what games do you or did you play? agent_2:I played the old Super Star Wars games on the SNES, and Knights of the Old Republic on Xbox. Those games were awesome agent_1:Those sound familiar.  Yeah, the older games and movies were better.  Speaking of older, i heard that James Earl Jones only spent a little over two hours recording his Darth Vadar lines and he was paid $7500.  I imagine he'd make a lot more if he were doing that today. agent_2:he probably would make no less than 100k a day! that voice is so iconic agent_1:It really is.  The Force Awakens movie just didn't do him or Vader justice in my opinion.	agent_2:you see I liked Force Awakens a lot. I like Kylo Ren. its a different spin because he conflicted and not just all big bad and evil	agent_1 likes movie. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['movie', 'award', 'movie'].

I did know however that Even though John Carter was considered a flop for Disney, it did great in Russia, even breaking box office records agent_1:Disney considered shutting down their animation studio after sleeping beauty was a box office failure.	agent_2:Good think it didn't.

Not all men in the uk had the vote until 1918. agent_1:Every US president with a beard has been a republican.  agent_2:Thats funny. It should be mandatory to have a beard if youre a president! Ha agent_1:Right! The use of red and blue for Dems and Repu only started in 2000. I would have thought it was longer.  agent_2:Right! I thought it would have been more than 19 years! agent_1:The toy industry gets involved before the beginning of the production of a movie according to disney. agent_2:And the development of the Disney film wreck it ralph started in the late 80's. agent_1:Wow spanning nearly 3 decades with four working titles.  agent_2:Just remarkable. I cant believe Frozen was the first animated Disney film directed by a woman. agent_1:I know and that cartoon practically took over my life. agent_2:Impressive!

It really makes you think about how it must be walking around on the moon doesn't it? agent_2:Yea, I wouldn't want to catch hay fever walking around with all that moon dust agent_1:i've heard that hay fever from moon dust is harmful to people. agent_2:I heard apollo 11 considered placing a UN flag on the moon instead of the US flag agent_1:Hmm, that could have been a good thing.  It would have included the whole planet.  What do you think? agent_2:I prefer the US flag, I mean everyone on Apollo 11 was from the US  agent_1:True. It was definitely an American accomplishment.  I wonder what made them decide not to use the UN flag. agent_2:I don't know. It's pretty interesting one of Saturn's moons may have methane based life agent_1:That is interesting!  Is it Titan?  I think that's Saturn's most well known moon. agent_2:Mars' mon Phobos is one third hollow, that's crazy	agent_1:That is crazy.

8499	agent_1:hi how are you? do you like baseball? agent_2:Hi, I think it is fun to learn about. I don't understand why the managers can also be players. That is sort of odd. agent_1:that must date back to the day when one of the players was chosen to manage as well. like an onfield boss or leader. agent_2:Oh okay, that makes more sense for sure. The rules can be outdated sometimes, I think. I remember a story about a man who found old baseball cards in his grandpas attic. Being outdated is a good thing then. agent_1:yes, those old cards would be worth a lot to someone. i would sell some of them and keep the rest as an investment. agent_2:Yes, the man found out that they were worth 3 million dollars, in fact. agent_1:that is wonderful chunk of change! more that you could make just by chatting online with someone, i think LOL Would you sell the cards? agent_2:Yeah, I think I would too. As soon as I hired a police escort to the bank. Baseball is so popular in Japan, did you know that? agent_1:yes, i have been to games there. the fans are different, but just as enthusiastic. i recommend going. agent_2:Oh, neat what a fun experience. Yeah I learned that the fans in Japan just can't believe that Americans consider it a passtime. agent_1:yes, they are not aware of how big stuff outside of Japan is. they think that 7-11 started in Japan. strange. but now many japanese players are in the MLB> agent_2:Oh wow, what a trip. I think its neat how pro athletes give things and money to causes. For instance some NFL player leave their shoes on the field n order to bring awareness to homelessness. agent_1:yes, that is a great way to raise awareness. i wish more athletes did things like that.  agent_2:Me too, it make a real difference. I am a big fan of Target too, lol. I guess just because they price match and I like to shop. agent_1:i havent gone there much. it looks like a clean, safe walmart. i guess it is good that they price match. agent_2:Yeah, they have all sorts of thing but havent sold tobacco since 1996.	agent_1:yeah, i thought that was strange. there is money in cigs, and people buy them. i guess they felt it was a bad way to make money.	agent_2 dislikes cigarette. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['cigarette', 'hobby', 'hobby story'].

It's just one shyster trying to get something over on the other guy, all the time.   agent_1:Yes but even in 2016 the CIA was meeting with senior congressional leaders over the fact that Putin had authorized an operation to destabilize our election agent_2:That's Putin for you, he's going to do that, hard to believe it took the CIA needing to tell them he was doing it.  I'm sure all of our ""frenemies""  do the same thing and we do it to them, too. agent_1:Yes but it is scary that McConnell is denying the evidence and claiming that it is just a scheme by the CIA to discredit Trump.  He does not believe all of our national security agencies. agent_2:On a different and much happier note than all that crazy political mess, do you realize the consistent use of the red and blue colors for Republicans and Democrats only started in 2000?  That's probably about the time it started to get real ugly in politics. agent_1:Yes that is crazy but it has been ugly for a while - Harry Truman visited disneyland and refused to be photographed on the dumbo ride because it might associate him with republicans!"	agent_2:You know the voter turnout for a US presidential election hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years.

Yeah, I like public transportation when traveling its fun.  agent_2:yes, it is a good way to learn about a country. public transportation is a cheap and convenient way to travel in a foreign land. i recommend it. agent_1:The first king to travel around the world was the king of hawaii. agent_2:he must have had a hankering to see the world and understand other peoples and cultures. i admire his sense of adventure and curiosity. agent_1:Yeah I wonder when he did that,  I cant remember a time where Hawaii had a king lol agent_2:I think it was King Kamehameha. he was the last king, i believe. agent_1:I see.  I hear Iceland has no public rail service,  most natives fly across the country. agent_2:that makes sense. iceland is very small and perhaps the terrain is not good for rail. planes could be very convenient. agent_1:I hope its not expensive to fly if people have to constantly do it.  agent_2:yes, they might have high speed buses too. that would be a hoot.

Apparently Tupac was pretty good too.  agent_2:Yea he portrayed the mouse king in a production of the nutcracker in high school for ballet! agent_1:Hilarious, I know he used to be a backup dancer for Digital Underground.  agent_2:Oh really? What an awesome fact! I know that when I was a baby, I would spontaneously dance (that's what my parents said). It's crazy how natural dancing is! agent_1:Hilarious. I didn't know that babies did that.  agent_2:I wonder if they do it more listening to K-Pop? That's the Korean music craze going on now! agent_1:Yeah, that is pretty funny. I'm not sure, MJ had a patent on dance moves though.  agent_2:I remember seeing a video on that. It allowed him to achieve an extreme lean on his dance moves? agent_1:yeah, that is pretty cool. What do you think about birds?  agent_2:I think birds are crazy lol. It's cool their entire skeleton weights less than their feathers! agent_1:yeah, that is pretty cool isn't it. What about hummingbirds, do you know anything about them?  agent_2:I know they steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. When I get a spider web on me, I freak out lol. agent_1:That is pretty scary. I wonder what noises birds in australia make?  agent_2:I think they've learned to make sounds like cameras, car alarms, and chainsaws.

I am a bit surprised to learn that the dodo bird is a real thing.  The are actually part of the pidgeon family.  agent_1:They are? I thought dodo birds were ficticious or extinct at least, you know that some birds travel really long distances without a rest agent_2:So did I.  Did you know that hummingbirds are known to take spiderwebs to use on their nests?  Little thieves...  agent_1:They do? I guess spiders must be angry at them then lol, you know that most birds have bones that are so hollow that their skeleton weights even less than their feather!! agent_2:Yeah, I bet there are a lot of bird-hating spiders.  I did know that but the wild birds of Australia have an added talent: they can mimic the sounds of stuff like car alarms and chainsaws.  agent_1:That must be interesting, I would love to hear a bird that sounds like a chainsaw lol, that bird has some identity issues for sure. agent_2:Yep, some bird therapy is in order.  FYI: I grew up on a ranch.  We had many horses but I didn't know one could be allergic to them.  Clint Eastwood is.  agent_1:He is? thats weird considered he has done many movies that involved horses and him riding them, agent_2:Yeah, an occupational hazard for sure... I didn't know that firefighters used dalmations to calm horses.  Most of our horses didn't really care for dogs.  agent_1:Thats an interesting fact did you also hear the story about the two kids that got suspended because they showed up riding horses to school? agent_2:Yeah, my dad used to ride horses to school in west Texas.  Man, horses go way back to 4000 BCE.  I wonder how they know that... agent_1:Yeah right? it seems like a difficult string of data to know, Icelandic horses must be really fast, agent_2:Yep. We had quarter horses and they are no slouches at speed.  I can see why it took 45-55 million years for them to evolve.  agent_1:I wonder whats the main difference between wild horses and caballus? I guess a wild horse can become a cabullus agent_2:A cowboy would say, ""they ain't broke yet"".  A cowboy would also have little use for rap.

We like to grill a lot outside, which helps not make our home more hot. agent_2:Grilling out is the best to help with the heat inside the house. If I have to cook in the house i do it early in the morning before it gets too hot. agent_1:Yes that's another great idea. We also sometimes eat out if it is way too hot, or eating something like salads or cereal. Where we aren't using heat at all. agent_2:That is a great idea. We tend to eat leftovers too and just use the micorwave. agent_1:The microwave is great and fast, I agree. Making Icecream is a great way to cool down when it gets too hot. We also tend to use box fans. agent_2:We use a fan for sure. Also started using like a slow cooker or toaster oven not as hot and now can fit up to a whole chicken.	agent_1:Great appliances help to cook! We love our air-fryer.

Some comics are really brutal and I don't like humor that hurts people. agent_1:He is actually a Dr.  He studied at Duke University. agent_2:That is interesting. I wonder why he went from medicine to humor? It's a good thing because he saved the woman in the story. agent_1:Yes, I heard about this awhile back.  A women was having a seizure.  He first thought she was a heckler. agent_2:Hecklers are not funny at all. I went to a comedy show where there were several and they ruined the whole performance. I don't think I could be a comedian you have to have a tough skin. He is good, though. agent_1:It is said that once he realized what was going on, he jumped off stage and into action. agent_2:I suspect that the training never leaves you. I would rather be a doctor but I guess he does really well acting. Comedy is a lot of fun if you don't hurt other people with jokes. agent_1:I'm sure he makes more as a comedian and actor.  After his actions he told the crowd that he checked her vitals and reassured the crowd.  They applaued him. agent_2:I like The Three Stooges type of humor. Or Mr. Bean. I just watched one of his movies and I laughed all the way through. He makes fun of himself, mostly. And it hurts no one.  agent_1:Ken got his break in a comedy contest.  He then moved to LA and performed sets after long days in a HMO clinic. agent_2:That must have been difficult so he must have a real gift for comedy. I will have to check it out.'The empire strikes back'  was a comedy and I did not even know that. I need to keep up these movies. agent_1:YOU SHOULD DO THAT.

I also saw that the Green Lantern movie was originally going to be a comedy with Jack Black. agent_2:The Greeks invented comedy as part of a dramatic performance. I would like to go back and see how funny they were compared to today's comedians. agent_1:I didn't know that.  Speaking of comedy and movies, The Avengers movie ""Infinity War"" was the first movie shot completely with digital imax cameras  agent_2:That's another one I haven't seen. That's is interesting, though. I like the raven's names Hugin and Munin. agent_1:I am a huge comic book fan.

Among users, women are more likely to own one than men agent_1:Oh cool fact. Microsoft in fact held a funeral to mark the death of the iPhone when they launched theirs agent_2:Wow that did not work very well because the iPhone has had tremendous sales agent_1:Exactly. Have you heard of the game send me to heaven? agent_2:I did, and Apple banned it because people were supposed to throw the phones as high as possible and risked damaging them  agent_1:That is so stupid. When Steve Jobs presented it first he has identical ones hidden because they kept crashing agent_2:Yeah it kept running our of ram and that is why it crashed.

Their net income is $-16 million and the revenue is $274 million agent_2:Wow that is so strange. Now they are streaming stand up comedy. agent_1:That is nice they are diversifying their stream. When Swift removed her music from iTunes she still kept it in Pandora agent_2:Maybe that means more of her fans moving over to Pandora, so that is good revenue right there agent_1:Yeah that is true.

I'm not sure how the gov't could destroy Wikileaks anyway. Too many sites, too many backups. agent_1:I agree. Did you know 86% of the land in Nevada is owned by the government? agent_2:The gov't must be up to something in Nevada. Maybe Wikileaks knows something about this. agent_1:That's where Area 51 is located so I'm sure there are lots of secret bases in that state. agent_2:I think Area 51 is in New Mexico, but I'm not sure. Lots of open space in Nevada.  agent_1:Oh yea you might be right lol. In 2006, the US passed a bill that would protect the government employees from being charged for violating the geneva conventions. agent_2:I think that is wrong, but probably there to protect military contractors and stuff. A lot of war going on in 2006. Probably a lot of liability.  agent_1:Yea, I was deployed to Iraq for the war back in 2005-2006 and then again in 2007. agent_2:Hm. I guess that you would be protected under the law. You made it back safe and sound I trust? The gov't has no plans to send you again?	agent_1:Yes, I made it back safe and sound thankfully.

LOL Who is your favorite GoT character? agent_2:I would have to say Khal Drogo.  Arya is the fastest rising baby name given to girls in the US...most likely due to Game of Thrones. agent_1:That guy is amazing. He played aquaman too. Arya is a good name. short, easy to spell.  agent_2:Yes!  GOT gets financed by Ireland because they film scenes there which boosts tourism incomes.  That makes sense. agent_1:I bet it is the same as LOTR and New Zealand. the locals might get tired of tourists though. agent_2:Maybe.  I myself would love it. lol  There is a National Geogrpahic wild show called Game of Lions that follows the lives of lions like GOT characters.  lol	agent_1:Hm. well, i guess that GoT is a cultural phenomenon.

1500	agent_1:Hello, do you like Star Wars? agent_2:I don't really though I do respect it as a franchise. How about you? agent_1:Yeah I like it. Lucas' wife made such changes to the script that she won the Academy Award agent_2:Star Wars is the second highest grossing film series of all time. It's spawned into a bunch of other media like books, video games, theme parks. agent_1:Yeah it has certainly taken over everything. It was even dubbed in Navajo agent_2:Cool! James Cameron decided to quit being a truck driver so that he could enter the film industry after watching Star Wars. I guess that was the right decision. agent_1:Oh for sure it was, the guy is a legend now. James Earl Jones got only $7500 recording Darth Vader's lines agent_2:Crazy! Fox thought Star Wars was going to flop and agreed to George Lucas's proposition to forgo an extra $500K directing fee so that he could keep licensing and merchandising rights. Their decision cost them billions of dollars agent_1:Yeah and at the same time made Lucas a billionaire. He just had a lot of confidence in his work agent_2:Yeah, in 2018 the whole Star Wars franchise was estimated at $65 billion	agent_1:That is insane.

Do you know why the managers wear uniforms? agent_2:I think they are technically allowed to play.  agent_1:Yeah, good for them, do you know what kickball is called in Canada? agent_2:No, do you play kickball? I did for fun a few years ago.  agent_1:I do not play it but apparently in Canada it is called soccer-baseball agent_2:Awesome, I've only been to Canada once. Have you been?  agent_1:Yes, I have friend there so I go all the time. Nice country and nice people agent_2:Awesome. Did you know Baseball is super popular in Japan?  agent_1:Yeah and they cannot believe that in the US is just a pastime? agent_2:yeah, that's awesome. The Cubs were the first team to win back to back world series.  agent_1:Nice, good for them. Do you know who used to do the schedule for major baseball laegue agent_2:No, do you? Apparently the Ottoman Empire was still in existence when the Cubs won the world series.  agent_1:Oh wow that means it goes way back then. Yeah it was a couple who did it for 24 years	agent_2:Yeah, that is crazy.

I honestly never heard of. Do you play video games? agent_1:No, But I did not know they were first designed for the military agent_2:It could be for training purpose. I'm wondering why Australia has more banned games than China... It means some US games also banned... It's quite strange. 	agent_1:it is like kids in korea being banned playing games after 12	agent_2 dislikes games. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['games', 'music', 'fan festival'].
10886	agent_1:Hi, how are you? Are you a music fan? agent_2:I listen to music whenever I can! I haven't been to a concert in a minute, but I tend to really enjoy those when it's an act I'm a fan of. I can appreciate orchestra, too, though. agent_1:Same, I do like some orchestra stuff like John Williams and the guy who does the Game of Thrones music. Can't say I would ever go to an orchestra festival like Shift though. agent_2:Festivals can be very stimulating but also very underwhelming or disappointing if they're not organized correctly. It sounds like Shift was not executed as well as it could have been, even if it was well-intended. agent_1:I think I haven't been to a concert myself in over 5 years, the last one being the Foo Fighters. agent_2:I saw REO Speedwagon and Chicago back last summer, and it reminded me that those shows are NOT fun if the music isn't loud. I heard the Foo Fighters played a concert so loud in New Zealand that it registered on seismic monitors! agent_1:That's awesome! I saw the first Global Citizen concert in Central Park that had Foo Fighters, Black Keys and Neil Young. That one was amazing. Huge venue in the park.	agent_2:That sounds fun--I guess that's kind of the ultimate venue for a festival. I was invited to a house concert last month and turned it down because it didn't sound fun, but there's a huge range in the kind of places you can have one. I suppose intimate venues work well for solo performances or ensembles involving instruments like pianos or violins.	agent_1 likes music. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['music', 'concert', 'Global Citizen concert'].

Have you ever seen videos of the dodo bird in action? agent_1:no I haven't, have you? I didn't think they had video recording back then? I think we only have artistic renderings of the dodo agent_2:Yeah I remember seeing video when I was younger I will never forget it.

11959	agent_1:Hey there. I just learned that GOP stands for Grand Old Party. Very traditional sounding. agent_2:That is exactly what I think too. The Republican party is old school so it fits very nicely! agent_1:There have been a total of 19 Republican presidents...the most of any party! agent_2:Wow, I didn't know that. Yes, the Republicans dominated politics nationally between 1860 and 1932!  agent_1:They always emphasize their abortion position, which all stemmed from the monumental Roe vs Wade 1973 Supreme Court Ruling. agent_2:Exactly. This was their platform and their support grew its evangelicals, leading to complete alignment with Christian conservatism. A lot different from the Democratic party. agent_1:Yes a stark contrast to the Democrats. The two parties heritage goes back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison's Democratic-Republican Party! agent_2:Yes, and the Republican party as of 2018 was the primary party of power in the USA.  Interesting though that there has not been a non republican / non democrat since 1853. agent_1:Yes I wish that wasn't the case. The more variety the better. 15% of the tea party movement identified as democrats! agent_2:I agree! I think we should all be open minded and not choose a side. the red and blue colors used for republicans and democrats only started being used consistently since 2000. I was watching some documentaries on youtube and it's all pretty interesting. agent_1:I love youtube! It is the second largest search engine on the net! agent_2:I watch Youtube a lot! Any little thing you want to find is on there! Google bought Youtube in 2006. Two huge platforms! agent_1:Yes they are. Gangnam Style got so many views that youtube had to upgrade the view integer to 64 bits!	agent_2:Wow, I remember when that was such a huge deal!

8917	"agent_1:Hi, how are you on this fine evening? agent_2:hi I'm doing great how about you, did you know Julius Caesar would write fan fiction when he was young, It was about hercules haha agent_1:I'm with George RR Martin on this issue. Fan fiction sucks. it is copyright violation. Someone should sue Julius Caesar! agent_2:haha yes! Maybe hercules can prove he is real by suing! I guess Edgar allen poe has the title for oldest example of a cyborg in fiction agent_1:Hercules never understood copyright law! Poe wasn't perfect, but he knew sci fi. agent_2:haha I didn't know that, what did he do? agent_1:He married a gal that was like 13 or something. I guess in his day that was not unusual but still. Probably to an author and alcoholic these were normal things. agent_2:ah I see well that is definitely weird, what I'm not surprised with is there is a wikipedia that ranks fictinoal characters, it does it according to their abilities, I'll tell you some people have a lot of time on their hands agent_1:I think that some people live for such things! They get notoriety from such endeavors, but no money. Can you believe that in the 1950s a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic because it featured a black character? That's an amazing judgement. agent_2:that is pretty bad for sure, what I want to see is the violin made of stone that you can actually play, I play the piano do you play any instruments agent_1:I used to play the guitar, but I weren't any good. I would blow hard into it, but it never sounded quite right. Perhaps I should have tried the violin, but I mistook it for a form of violence. agent_2:haha I like that, ya my uncle plays the violin but he says its really hard to learn, the piano isn't that bad in my opinion, it has a good amount of challenge but I think anyone can get pretty good with enough practice agent_1:I would like to think that I could be as good as Einstein. He was a musician, but he didn't really gain renown as one. I could do as well as him, don't you think? agent_2:ah I didn't know that, well I think you can do it! just make sure to use modern violins and not the million dollar stradivarius ones, modern ones sound better in blind tests agent_1:I would never be able to tell the difference. Perhaps Einstein could, but I couldn't. If Haydn wrote a competition with the two varieties of violin ar the end, could the audience tell the difference? agent_2:haha good question, what is cool that Einstein said is that ""the greatest scientists are artists as well"" agent_1:But then again, are the greatest artists scientists? Perhaps not. Or perhaps so. Perhaps I don't know. I want to hear a violin made out of stone, a piano made out of stone for the Flintstones. agent_2:haha I like that, would you ride a bus that goes 160mph? they are making on in Denmark apparently agent_1:The Danes are seditious, don't trust them! They lie! They eat too much butter!

8730	agent_1:Do you have children? agent_2:No I do not, how about you? agent_1:I do and he seems to be hitting puberty. Moody tween all the time. agent_2:Ah I assume that is causing some difficultly. Is there anything in particular he is stubborn on?  agent_1:He is a great kid, until he plays Fortnite. Something about that game gets him all jacked up and he acts like a different kid. agent_2:There have been a lot of studies on video games and it's effect on children. The consensus always seems to be that they use it as an outlet.  agent_1:I think listening to the way the other people talk and act affects him. He's usually mild and polite, but when he plays with them, he gets very hyper and surly. I also think it's the change in hormones. agent_2:That could very well be the case. Hormones seem to do something to susceptibility, at least it was for me as a teen.  agent_1:He's also at the awkward, trying to figure out who he is, stage. It's fun to really watch his personality develop. agent_2:It's such a weird place to be in the world. They are starting to take on more adult responsibilities but at the same time are still kids in a lot of ways.  agent_1:Right! He is such a little kid about some things, but he's starting to look at girls differently and it's a weird situation to be in. He used to tell me everything, but not so much anymore. agent_2:Wanting to have some secrets its about right developmentally speaking. Just feeling out some small forms of independence.  agent_1:His voice has also started to change. He is taking after his father with a super low, bass filled voice. It's crazy to hear that low deep voice come out of a kid! I'm wondering what else we are going to be in store for as he changes? agent_2:Has he already been through the outgrowing every bit of clothing stage?  agent_1:He's growing like he's getting paid for it! Every weekend we are going through his clothes and getting rid of what is too small! Especially pants and long sleeve shirts, he has long legs and arms. agent_2:Ugh, that has got to be the worst. Even with standard clothing it's got to be expensive and then occasions come up where you need things like suits and you know odds are they are only going to wear it once.  agent_1:We are sticking with a lot of khaki pants and nice dress shirts. If he has to have a suit, we'll have to buy it a couple of days before the event, there's no other way to deal with it. agent_2:That is a really smart plan. Forget even trying to tailor it, it will never be worth the cost and time.	agent_1:I agree totally, tailoring is not worth it at all. I've been lucky with consignments and things so far, but the more he grows and the older he gets, I can't do that as much anymore. I just hope that puberty won't be terribly long as far as the growing is concerned.	agent_2 likes family. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['family', 'TV', 'actor'].
5083	agent_1:Hi, how are you doing this evening? agent_2:Hi I'm doing well. Do you like baseball? I personally think it's really boring haha agent_1:Baseball is a slow game. I usually pay attention around the time of the playoffs. Then there's a lot of energy. agent_2:Yeah it gets burst of energy, and then a lot of really boring Parts LOL. I never knew that baseball managers could actually play for their team. That's why they wear uniforms, duh agent_1:Yeah, it's easier to just watch the highlight reel. The managers probably played way back in the day. Now? It would be sad. I'd want my money back. agent_2:Haha yep they would probably get injured really quickly LOL have you ever played kickball when you were a kid agent_1:I played kickball. Safer than dodgeball, that's for sure. agent_2:Yep I agree with you there. In Canada they call kickball soccer-baseball instead, it doesn't quite have the same ring LOL agent_1:It sure doesn't. That's clunky name. Baseball is so popular in Japan that many fans are surprised to discover it's  america's national pastime. I wonder why? The sport started here. agent_2:I agree with you. It's very screwy that they would not realize that LOL oh, did you hear about the man who found millions of dollars of baseball cards and his grandfather's attic? Now that is living the dream haha agent_1:That would be great! I would sell some of them, but keep some for a long-term investment. You never know how much they could be worth one day. agent_2:No you're right. That's why I don't throw anything away. And it's also why my house is a mess LOL. One thing I don't understand is why the MLB used a married couple for 24 years to schedule all their games, why wouldn't they use a computer agent_1:The couple probably used some kind of technology, but I bet they had a friend at the MLB head office. Maybe they were inexpensive? I dunno. agent_2:haha ya, and they did that until 2005, very crazy!	agent_1:That's a long time. Do you watch the World Series?

Freddie mercury used the same piano to record bohemian rhapsody as paul mccartney used to record hey jude agent_2:cool! ever hears of Eurovision? agent_1:No, what's that? agent_2: Song Contest in england. agent_1:Oh ok.  In 2006 a group of climbers reached the top of britain's highest mountain and found a piano agent_2:neat! apparently the competition away from its usual reliance on over-the-top spectacle. agent_1:An aluminum grand piano was built for the lounge of the airship hindenburg. it weighed only 356 pounds. agent_2:Wow! I did not know that! Portuguese broadcaster RTP had stripped the Eurovision stage of the walls of LED screens that have become ubiquitous backdrops in recent years. agent_1:When eddie van halen recorded the guitar solo for ""beat it"" he literally set the studio speakers on fire. agent_2:Oh my gosh! DO you like Jazz? agent_1:No, not really.  You? agent_2:Some, but Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans. agent_1:There is a programming language in which the programs are written in musical composition, and functional programs have jazz-like harmonies. agent_2:I had no idea! Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, agent_1:A harlem woman has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every sunday for 20 years. top performers occasionally stop by. agent_2:Thats neat! New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation. agent_1:Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts. agent_2:Clint eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast, pianist, and scored several films, including million dollar baby. agent_1:Clint Eastwood movies are awesome agent_2:they are/ I like grand Torino especially. what is your fave? agent_1:That's great one.  Unforgiven was awesome agent_2:I'll have to look that one up! Jazz trumpeters grew goatees as it provided comfort when playing."	agent_1:I didn't realize that.  That's very interesting.

By comparison to Japan, the US comic book market in the US and Canada is $1.09 billion! agent_1:That's crazy, Japan is way more into comic books than America it seems.  agent_2:I agree!  The Marvel cinematic universe takes place in earth -199999, a multiverse different from the original comic book multiverse, earth-616! agent_1:That's pretty wild. Marvel published a ""generic comic book,"" in order to trademark the names ""superhero"" and ""super-villain."" That was pretty smart of them.  agent_2:No doubt!  Do you know much about the planets or the universe? agent_1:I know a little bit. I've heard that Venus does not tilt.  agent_2:That interesting.  Uranus is different to.

2530	agent_1:Hello, are you a big Netflix person? agent_2:I am!  I have been a subscriber for years and especially love the original content! agent_1:I do as well! Were you a subscriber even back when their whole business model was about DVD rental by mail and not an online platform? agent_2:I was! I think it was in 2007 when they started adding streaming features. agent_1:It's interesting to think how differently the company could have been if decisions played out differently. Like Blockbuster declining to buy them many times, and now they're worth many times over. agent_2:Exactly! A purchase of $50 million that is now worth $2 billion. That is just CRAZY! agent_1:And I feel like that doesn't even big to desribe how huge Netflix is still. Netflix accounts for a third of ALL bandwith in North America from 9pm to 12 am!	agent_2:Which is honestly just nuts. And when you combine Netflix and youtube, it's half of the peak internet traffic in North America alone!	agent_1 likes technology. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['technology', 'blockbuster', 'no'].

11966	"agent_1:Hey there. I just learned that GOP stands for Grand Old Party. Very traditional sounding. agent_2:That is exactly what I think too. The Republican party is old school so it fits very nicely! agent_1:There have been a total of 19 Republican presidents...the most of any party! agent_2:Wow, I didn't know that. Yes, the Republicans dominated politics nationally between 1860 and 1932!  agent_1:They always emphasize their abortion position, which all stemmed from the monumental Roe vs Wade 1973 Supreme Court Ruling. agent_2:Exactly. This was their platform and their support grew its evangelicals, leading to complete alignment with Christian conservatism. A lot different from the Democratic party. agent_1:Yes a stark contrast to the Democrats. The two parties heritage goes back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison's Democratic-Republican Party! agent_2:Yes, and the Republican party as of 2018 was the primary party of power in the USA.  Interesting though that there has not been a non republican / non democrat since 1853. agent_1:Yes I wish that wasn't the case. The more variety the better. 15% of the tea party movement identified as democrats! agent_2:I agree! I think we should all be open minded and not choose a side. the red and blue colors used for republicans and democrats only started being used consistently since 2000. I was watching some documentaries on youtube and it's all pretty interesting. agent_1:I love youtube! It is the second largest search engine on the net! agent_2:I watch Youtube a lot! Any little thing you want to find is on there! Google bought Youtube in 2006. Two huge platforms! agent_1:Yes they are. Gangnam Style got so many views that youtube had to upgrade the view integer to 64 bits! agent_2:Wow, I remember when that was such a huge deal! Interesting that Netflix and Youtube make up half of peak internet traffic in north america. That is amazing! agent_1:Yes people love to watch entertainment! Police actually have their own platform called blutube! I wonder how people can access that service? agent_2:That is awesome! The police really can benefit from that! I bet an average person can't use their site. I bet it helps them out a lot. My favorite thing to look up on youtube is music, I like the videos. Or the do it yourself video's, how about you? agent_1:I love DIY videos too, so helpful. I never use the like/dislike feature. But a lot of people disliked Bieber's ""baby"" video. agent_2:I heard that too, which seems strange that it was the most watched video for a long time back when it 1st came out. So many people getting wealthy by having a youtube channel and following....that's what I would like to do lol! agent_1:Yes it would be nice to get endorsed by youtube! You should do it! That way you can contribute to all that internet traffic! Well it was lovely chatting with you! agent_2:Yes, I have been looking into a subscription to a do it yourself type channel!

I wonder why. agent_2:Im not sure, they probably werent the ones downloading that game send me to heaven and launching them into the air. agent_1:Ha ha maybe. Have you heard of the band Muse? agent_2:Cant say that I have, what do they do? agent_1:Kind of pop rock. Matt Bellamy of Muse recorded his unborn son's heartbeat with his iPhone and used it on a song recording.  agent_2:That is pretty neat.  It is certainly a huge part of our society today, I am glad it has developed from the first versions where Jobs had to switch it out because it kept crashing. agent_1:That's so embarrassing. I hope he pulled it off. Microsoft held an iPhone funeral when they released their phones. That was presumptuous.  	agent_2:Very much so, I bet apple just laughed.

I heard that it's opening was a career low opening day total for Spacey, though. It's because of all the bad accusations against him, I think. agent_2:I saw him in the movie Baby Driver, but the accusations are definitely a deterrent for some people with how widespread #MeToo has become agent_1:Yes, I actually haven't seen him in a movie since American Beauty. I watch movies on Netflix sometimes. Do you?"	agent_2:I have to be in the mood since I like to read and listen to a lot of books.

So, I watch with her. agent_1:That's cool! Apparently it's so popular in Japan that there surprised it's our (Americas) past time.  agent_2:Yes, I heard about that.  Apparently baseball managers wear uniforms in case they have to play to replace players. agent_1:I wonder if that's ever happened before? Did you know that baseball use to be referred to as the Fall classics? agent_2:I will research about it later.  No, I did not know that (the fall classics). agent_1:Because in north america it is played during the fall season.  agent_2:I see.  Thank you for the information.  A married couple used to schedule all 2430 major league baseball games played each year for 24 years.   agent_1:That must of been pretty cool for them to do together. so the baseball season is how many games. do you know? agent_2:2430 games, I think.  I might be wrong. agent_1:That's a lot of games, no wonder pitcher arms get burned out. Just to refresh my memory a run is scored when a player legally crosses the bases, right? agent_2:A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases and touches home plate. agent_1:Right, and the team that scores the most points wins. Why is the word legally used can you get bases illegally?  agent_2:I don't know why the specifically use the word ""legally"".    agent_1:Now there is a such thing as stealing a base right? Some one told me that the ottoman empire was still in existence win the cubs won the world series.  agent_2:My granddaughter knows much more about baseball.  I think you are right, there is such a thing as stealing a base. Babe Ruth was caught doing it to end game 7 and lose the 1926 World Series. agent_1:Wow that had to hurt. I heard that the Chicago cubs were the first team to win back to back super bowls and haven;t won since. "	agent_2:I think what you meant was World Series since Super bowl is for football games.

I saw Wikileaks once published the government's plan to shutdown Wikileaks. agent_1:that is awesome, that is really sticking it to the man. I wonder if they released why 86% of Nevada is owned by the government agent_2:That's a lot of Nevada they own. I bet there are tons of secret bases and things like that out there. agent_1:I am sure there has to be. It is all desert, but I am sure they are doing some crazy things there agent_2:I bet they are. In 2008, the Norwegian government donated $1 billion to help save the Amazon rainforest.  agent_1:Wow, that is something!

I didn't know that babies did that.  agent_2:I wonder if they do it more listening to K-Pop? That's the Korean music craze going on now! agent_1:Yeah, that is pretty funny.

SO TINY.. agent_1:I also find it interesting that some birds can fly from alaska to north america without sleeping when they migrate. agent_2:Birds are very interesting because of a lot of facts.  I think it helps with their flight that their bones are hollow so not weighed down.  agent_1:Yes, they are interesting. I did not know that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. I find that very interersting. agent_2:I have watched them pull some to make them nearby.  The way they flit about is so beautiful to watch.  It is almost elegant like a dance. ..performing art! agent_1:Yes, did you know that Jackie Chan manages a k-pop band. I did not know that but i think it's cool. agent_2:It seems that so many you wouldn't think to have other interests do.  Jackie in music, Bruce Lee in dancing.  A championship even! agent_1:It seems to be in a kpop band you have to be tough because they go through bootcamps before being signed.	agent_2:Boot camps for bands..

Did you know that Roberto Osuna hasn't pitched since May 6 serving a 75 game suspension agent_1:I knew he was suspended but not for that long,what team is he on now? agent_2:I believe the Astros agent_1:Oh, I knew he was on the blue jays, that's a pretty high risk trade considering Osuna violated the domestic violence policy agent_2:Yes.  Apparently the Yankees trade with the Reds for Chapman before the 2016 season when Chapman was set to serve a suspension for a domestic abuse incident is similar agent_1:Yea, I remember that, although Chapman is a great closer I wish the Yankees wouldn't of traded for him in 2016 due to his incidents agent_2:It seems risky.  But the Astros seemed to want a late-inning reliever badly enough to get Osuna  agent_1:Yea, as former world series champions they started to get worried they only had a 4 game lead in their division agent_2:Did you know that a married couple scheduled all the major league games for 24 years up until 2005 agent_1:Now but that must of took them a lot of time agent_2:A man found $3 million  in baseball cards in his grandfather's attic agent_1:I'm surprised they were still in good condition after being hidden since the 1940s agent_2:Yes, I wish I found them.  Interestingly speaking of baseball it says that in 1973 two yankee pitchers switched families permanently.  I wonder what that means? agent_1:I'm not sure either, maybe they both divorced their wives and then married them agent_2:In August 1991 Don Mattingly was actually suspended for not getting a haircut.

I have a sad story to tell there are less tigers living in the wild in Asia than as pets in the US. agent_1:Really? That's awful to hear! agent_2:Of Roosevelt's 20 pets two were a bear and hyena! agent_1:Whoa, cool! I know he seemed to be quite the animal lover. agent_2:And there are more pets in Japan than there are children under 15. You can't be a pets ""OWNER"" in Boulder but you can be their guardian.   agent_1:I have a pet. I am an ailurophile meaning I love cats. agent_2:Cool word! Did you know there are 20 quintillion animal varieties on Earth? agent_1:That is a lot! And in 2002 Germany gave them legal rights. agent_2:Yeah, and the Loch Ness monster is protected under the 1912 Scottish Animal Protection Act. agent_1:I wonder if the immortal jellyfish needs protecting... being immortal and all. agent_2:Lol...speaking of water animals, did you know that hiccoughs are a left over from evolution when we had gills? agent_1:Maybe that connection is part of why 84% of human disease genes have counterparts in zebrafish, too... hmm. agent_2:Hmm? Good theory. Seeing that the most popular pets are cats and dogs it is no surprise that they are commonly used for therapy in hospitals. agent_1:Well, they are good at helping people adjust to new situations, too. agent_2:Yes, like for elderly who are without companions. agent_1:Or people with anxiety and depression, or kids with autism. agent_2:Yes, a seahorse wouldn't be very good for that purpose. Did you know seahorses are the only fish with a neck? agent_1:I don't think a black swallower fish would be good as a companion pet either because it can eat prey twice its length! agent_2:That would freak me out! But I bet it catches that prey using its acoustic communication! agent_1:Could be. Fish are cool like that. I think it's neat that amphibians and reptiles and birds and mammals all had the same ancestry with fish. agent_2:I wonder if reptiles are considered ectothermic like most fish? agent_1:That would be a good thing to know, especially because some of them make good pets. agent_2:Yep, but I don't know if walking a gecko would give the same health benefits as walking a dog agent_1:Probably not. Dog walking is good because it gives companionship and exercise at the same time. agent_2:Hey, did you know the first marine predator was the shark? They developed in the Silurian period. agent_1:Very interesting. I wonder how many aquatic species have gone extinct since then... agent_2:Or have evolved into other species. The shark has a higher core temperature than other fish because it is an active swimmer. agent_1:That makes sense. I always thought sharks were pretty interesting because they have cartilage instead of bone. agent_2:Yes, fascinating fact! Tuna also hold a higher core temperature. They are in the same class as shark because they are also active swimmers. agent_1:Tuna can get quite large, too. It's cool how big some fish get. agent_2:One more before we go...did you know domesticated animals develop a white patch on their forehead? agent_1:Yeah. that is a pretty cool way to know they are domesticated rather than wild."	agent_2:Very cool chatting with you.

12913	agent_1:Good morning.  So, the other day I was shopping for a shirt and then I heard that originally shirts used to be an item worn exclusively by men.  How strange. agent_2:Maybe because women only wore dresses? agent_1:Maybe, that would make sense.  In America we will call most anything a shirt, but in British English it is specifically what we would refer to as a dress shirt.  That could be confusing if you are visiting another country. agent_2:Oh, so that is probably what they meant-women did not used to wear dress shirts. agent_1:Maybe.  I am glad I don't work somewhere I have to wear dress shirts or button up shirts.  There are also button down shirts, which is where the collar also has buttons. agent_2:If you're in Hawaii, the official business attire is the aloha shirt. That seems fun. agent_1:Which is why I love Hawaii so much.  Aloha shirts are great.   agent_2:In China gangs used to layer on as many shirts as possible. That seems, um, uncomfortable. agent_1:Yeah, and they used to pop the collars.  I remember when popping your polo shirt collar was a fashion around here. agent_2:It's interesting that polo shirts were invented for one specific tennis player. agent_1:Yeah, the ones with the crocodile on them. agent_2:It's interesting that they got named polo shirts since polo players didn't adopt them until later. agent_1:It's funny how clothing gets certain names. agent_2:Yes, it is. I like to wear polos when I go out. I think they are fancy enough for a night out. I'd like to attend a monthly music fest that occurs at Gee's club. agent_1:Oh yeah?  I have heard about that place.  What kind of music is played there? agent_2:They play oldies. Since about a year and a half ago since the death of Royal Torrence, it's been a monthly affair.  agent_1:That sounds like a lot of fun.  I heard they have a lot of different musicians that play there. agent_2:Yeah, it is pretty popular. It's only a $5 donation. agent_1:Oh wow, that's neat that it is a donation and not a mandatory cover.  I am sure a lot of people go there to drink and dance and listen to all kinds of music. agent_2:Yeah, it's cool that it started to celebrate someone's life when they died.

I am glad that they have the opportunity.  Do you follow the republican party? agent_1:yes, every president with a beard has been a republican:) agent_2:not sure how accurate that is, Trump does not have a beard agent_1:just meant the ones that have had a beard, it seems like red and blue has been used forever for rep & dems but did you know it only started in 2000? agent_2:I understand.  I thought the red and blue would have started earlier.  I feel like I have seen it forever. agent_1:same, also only dem or rep president since 1853, time for an independent? agent_2:I agree with that, they have least funding though	agent_1:true, hows this for voting, Indian govt set up poll in a forest with lions	agent_2 likes politics. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'news', 'no'].

Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent or in teams agent_2:I watch it sometimes when Serena Williams is playing agent_1:yeah i like to watch her play. Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis by famous player rene ""the crocodile"" lacoste. i love their colgne for men agent_2:Intresting, the longest match played in a polo shirt was 22 hours agent_1:yeah if i recall it went over three days or so agent_2:That's a long time, I don't think I've ever done anything for 3 days straight agent_1:im not sure if its true but Us open quarterfinalist gael monfils beat the ""roger federer of paddle tennis"" after learning how to play just days earlier. agent_2:Man that's crazy, almost as crazy as using a helicopter to dry grass tennis courts agent_1:yeah i have heard that as well and though it sounded really dangerous. i wonder if their were people in the crowd? agent_2:I hope not, if I was there I'd be cold agent_1:yeah. In 1998, serena and venus williams said they could beat any man ranked 200 or worse in a game of tennis. they lost when challenged twice lol agent_2:lol, well she did win the australian open when she was ranked 95th agent_1:i have heard Serena williams is a co-owner of the miami dolphins agent_2:I didn't know that, she speaks french and italian so I wonder if she owns any sports teams in Europe agent_1:not sure but In january 2007, serena williams was ranked 95th in the world in tennis agent_2:I never knew she was ever ranked that low agent_1:well she reached the No. 1 ranking for the first time on July 8, 2002 but has since fallen"	agent_2:Wow, shes so good though, she won a grand slam while pregnant	agent_1 likes sports. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['sports', 'TV show', 'adventure'].

1682	agent_1:Good Morning! Do you like to watch horror films? agent_2:Hi, how are you? I am not really a fan of the genre, though I have some favorites. agent_1:What are some of your favorite ones? Stephen king considers Bambi one haha. agent_2:King was just a kid, to be fair. That movie could be scary to a tiny child. He then turned his fright into a profession. agent_1:You're right on that one. Did you know you can burn 180 calories watching one? agent_2:I suppose that I could try to lose weight that way. It might be easier to exercise. I like a couple of films, but after the first viewing, they are not as scary. agent_1:Just do a marathon one day of watching them and you'll be set. Have you seen the Shining? The boy actor didn't even know it was a horror film until years later. agent_2:I liked the Shining. King wrote a great story and it translated well to the screen. I am surprised by the kid though. What did he think it was? agent_1:That is a good question. You would think watching the cinematography alone would let you know it was one! agent_2:I wonder if he ever saw the film while he was a kid. I think maybe his parents wouldn't let him.  agent_1:That could be it! Did you know no woman has ever been nominated for best cinematography at the oscars? agent_2:That is a shame. I don't know how many women cinematographers there are, but probably not enough. There should be more. agent_1:I agree with you! Especially with the box office at what it is. I would hate to work for the movie Trojan Wars. They made only 309 dollars on a budget of 15 million! agent_2:Movies are such a crapshoot. There is no magic formula for success.

But instead of booing, the audience member cheers and makes their own sound effects. agent_2:Well that was sure nice of them to do that, I'm sure Spielberg appreciated it! agent_1:Right, usually that would be embarrassment. That was cool of the audience. Ready Player One is another childlike adventure where virtual reality dominates. agent_2:It sounds cool, my grandkids would probably like it.  I remember when I first saw Jaws, it scared me to death! agent_1:Yeah, I know what you mean. Ready Player one takes place on an Earth where people go to VR to escape their real life problems.

Any other animals were not very lucky. It was very sad. We need to do more to protect animals agent_2:oh wow. Here in Iowa we don't really see fires like that. But I agree we do need to protect animals agent_1:There are so many different kinds of animals in the world. many are going way too. We need to be more like Germany. Have you head of what they are doing? agent_2:I have not really heard about what they are doing agent_1:they are projecting the rights of animals by giving them constitutional rights agent_2:that is a really good idea more counties should have that agent_1:yeah very cool right! We humans come from animals basically. Would you agree? agent_2:I would agree agent_1:We have so much of the same DNA and how we used to have so much hair back in the day like over 200000 years ago. That's crazy! agent_2:I can't it been that long agent_1:could be. Probably is goes all the way back to Africa I've recently learned. We are basically African animals at one point lol agent_2:I can see that. We sure have come along way since then agent_1:or not lol..... I randomly learned sound can cause fear in humans. That's pretty wild agent_2:I believe that. I know there are some sounds that cause me fear agent_1:I wonder how that happens.

Mookie Betts seems to really be getting some distance on his hits.  agent_1:That's a new name to me, seems like a name from a Star Wars movie.  I wonder if they are the best team in baseball right now? agent_2:I really don't know.  They have a picture named Porcello that is really good.  It sounds like they have a good balance between pitching and hitting. agent_1:I'm originally from a different country but my wife is from Cleveland.  She used to get very excited in the late nineties when they had a good team. agent_2:That's cool.  I guess FanGraphs estimates that the Red Sox have a 71% chance to win the division.  That's good for your wife.  What country are you from? agent_1:England, been here over twenty years.  Have not really got into baseball, went to a few games in the past at Camden Yard and Jacobs Field. agent_2:Well, a very belated ""welcome"".  Are you a cricket fan?  I didn't realize that the NYT owned part of the Sox.   agent_1:I am, used to play to a fairly high level.  Isn't that sacrilege for the NYT to be involved with Boston, or are they just hedging their bets. agent_2:Yes, I had the same thought.  They are such rivals.  It's wild that baseball managers can actually play in the game.  I have never seen that. agent_1:I guess it's in the rules, that's why they wear the uniform.  I'd love to see one of those really old managers walk up to bat one day."	agent_2:Yeah.  It would be even better if that old manager knocked it out of the park.

I heard without cars, they use domestic flights to travel. agent_1:That is interesting, it certainly helps people getting over their fear of flying lol. I wonder if it is because of the terrain agent_2:I am not sure. But I do know it is very cheap to travel. agent_1:That is awesome, at least they make it cheap. Have you been to mackinac island in MI? agent_2:No, I have not. I heard they don;t have vehicles. agent_1:I heard that too. That would be rough, but at least you would get in shape on vacation lol. Or ride horses. agent_2:Very true, you would need a horse-drawn carriage or even a bike to get around. agent_1:That would be interesting. It would be more relaxing I think in my opinion. Maybe they will bring the bus from the Dutch that goes 160 mph! agent_2:I wonder if people get dizzy looking out of the window. agent_1:I bet, or fear for their lives as they are traveling in a bus going that fast agent_2:True.

I used Amazon for practically everything, but I also used Google. I guess I'm not alone because when Google went down for about five minutes in 2013, 40% of the web traffic went down with it. agent_1:I love Google as well, you know it was founded by two PHD students in Standford University agent_2:Yeah, and together they own 14 percent of the company, and control about 56% of the stockholder voting power. agent_1:I thought they owned a bigger percentage of the company, I heard the company wants to reoganize some of its interests in a company called Alphabet Inc agent_2:Yes, they actually announced that several years ago. Most recently, Larry Page was removed as the CEO of Google and is now the CEO of Alphabet. agent_1:A guess that makes sense, Google is a big company and it must have more than one CEO for different divisions, have you ever used the Maps app?	agent_2:Yeah, it's interesting how they determine the borders of countries with disputed borders.	agent_1 dislikes politics. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['politics', 'technology', 'e-commerce'].

Among users, women are more likely to own one than men agent_1:Oh cool fact. Microsoft in fact held a funeral to mark the death of the iPhone when they launched theirs agent_2:Wow that did not work very well because the iPhone has had tremendous sales agent_1:Exactly. Have you heard of the game send me to heaven? agent_2:I did, and Apple banned it because people were supposed to throw the phones as high as possible and risked damaging them 	agent_1:That is so stupid.

I also didn't know that the Prime Minister selects and then can dismiss members of the cabinet. I always wondered what they did agent_1:It's a little strange, isn't it? But on a lighter note, a radio station prank called Queen Elizabeth II back in 95, pretending to be Jean Chretien who was the Prime Minister of Canada back then. Ha! agent_2:That is very strange. Do you know who Helena Bonham Carter is? She was in the Harry Potter movies, but anyway she is the great-granddaughter of a prime minister agent_1:Is that so? I wonder if she used her family to become an actress? Ha! Well in Japan, their Prime Minister sends their residents a silver cup when they turn 100 to celebrate it. Problem is, so many are turning 100 now, they're having to find ways to make cheaper cups. That's a good thing though! agent_2:That is a good thing! What do you think about Wikileaks by the way? Apparently the government try to destroy them, but Wikileaks just leaked their plans LOL agent_1:That's kind of ironic, isn't it? I wonder if Wikileaks will tell us what the government does with the 86% of Nevada's land that they own? agent_2:That is a good question. Maybe it is Area 51 that they own haha? It's also crazy to think that Norway donated a billion dollars to help save the rainforest, I wonder if they own the land or just donated it agent_1:That's a good question. I'm glad they're taking action to protect the rainforests though! Did you ever hear about the guy in France who posed as a government official and sold the Eiffel Tower twice? It's like how did he pull that off? Someone like him could sell fire in hell! Ha! agent_2:Haha yes a very talented salesman for sure! Definitely a scam too.

His newest album is called man of the Woods by the way agent_2:Wasn't is previous album FutureSex/LoveSounds in 2006?  What is the reason for the long dry spell? agent_1:Yeah I don't know. I think he just needed some time to get his bearings. I guess a lot of people think that his songs feel empty in this new release though agent_2:Thinking back, about the only thing I remember about Justin Timberlake is NippleGate in the 2004 Super Bowl.  From what I read, in the interim has broken into acting, gotten married and became a father.  Do people think his songs are ""empty"" because he has changed his style or do they think he has lost his musical bearing?  His major life changes may have changed his musical perspective. agent_1:Yes I think is you could alter your taste in music will change. What do you think about albums though? Who made your favorite album  agent_2:Pink Floyd ""The Wall"" is my favorite.  Did you know ""The Dark Side of the Moon"" is still one of the best selling albums after 40 years!  And yours? agent_1:Wow that's great! I also love Pink Floyd and I love Metallica, I know that my friend loves Linkin Park and they have a best selling album right now agent_2:I did not know that.  What I find interesting is the resurgence in vinyl LPs for audiophiles.  Most of my music is digital, except for some local Louisiana bands who never made it big.  I still have their vinyl albums and play them every now and then.  What do you think of NWA's Straight Outta Compton? agent_1:I think it's a great album! It's crazy that it went platinum without getting any AirPlay or without them doing a tour agent_2:Do you think that the movie by the same name had anything to do with it going platinum? agent_1:Yes I think it went platinum before the movie came out haha. Have you heard about the famous Japanese rappers though? They are twins and also 100 years old agent_2:That's hilarious!  But it shows the international reach of pop music.

People nowadays are just plain crooked. agent_1:I was only just made aware of that offer.  There are always people willing to exploit a system like that. agent_2:But, to go as far as to buy things at a yard sale and try to return them, that's just taking it to a new level of exploitation.  A crook will always be a crook, for sure! agent_1:This kind of promise works well in a small group, but once it goes national you lose the personal connection, and some will exploit it. agent_2:How true.  On a side note, do you own any UGG boots? agent_1:Not my style.  I see them around all the time now, are they comfortable? agent_2:Yeah, they are very comfortable and quite warm.  Do you know they were invented by surfers? agent_1:Looking at Uggs I would not associate them with surfing.  I suppose they keep you feet warm? agent_2:Yes, the surfers would put them on after leaving that cold ocean water, to warm up! agent_1:My boot and shoe supply is limited.  I have some work shoes and some running shoes, and one pair of dress shoes.   agent_2:Well, that's really all one needs! agent_1:I've tried the trick with the tea bag and smelly shoes, it does remove the smelly odor, replaces it with Earl Grey. agent_2:How cool, I'll have to give that a try, I have a stinky pair of gym shoes! agent_1:So Nokia use to make boots, difficult to see how they got into phones from that. agent_2:Rubber boots to be exact, and I think they still make them, too!	agent_1:Probably best to stick with the boots.

I recently saw Bill Burr and he was very funny. agent_2:That's cool.  I like comedy movies and tv shows.  Have you ever seen 3rd rock from the sun? agent_1:I have watched a few episodes but I didn't follow it closely? How about you? agent_2:I've seen a few. I heard it beat out Seinfeld, Friends, and even Frasier for the best comedy award in 1997. agent_1:That was a lot of great shows nominated at once. I watch a lot of Brooklyn Nine Nine now, I think that's one of the best shows on TV. agent_2:I've never seen it but I have seen the commercials and it looks funny.  You are right about all those great shows.  Sounds like there was a lot of good comedy back in 1997. agent_1:It's definitely not the same these days as it was back then. I think the rise of cable prices has hurt how many people are watching TV. agent_2:Speaking of cable tv. What do you think of comedy central? agent_1:I like Comedy Central, I haven't watched it as much lately because I have been watching Netflix and Amazon Prime more. agent_2:Comedy Central may be very particular on how they do comedy.  I've heard they've canceled over 100 shows since they started back in 1989. agent_1:That's a lot of shows to cancel. I know from watching Daniel Tosh's show he would reference a show they canceled quickly each week. agent_2:Really?  I guess they are selective then.  i've never watched the channel. Do they do different types of comedy or just one? agent_1:They have a lot of original programming so they broadcast a wide variety of comedy. They also air original stand up comedy specials as well. agent_2:So have you ever seen ken jeong perform?	agent_1:I have not seen him perform his stand up yet. He just released a new special on Netflix. I have only seen him in movies and on TV.	agent_2 likes entertainment. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['entertainment', 'TV shows', 'TV'].

7880	agent_1:Hello do you like baseball? agent_2:I do like baseball. I think it's crazy that the baseball managers can actually play the game. That's why they wear the uniforms agent_1:Yeah that is,  considering theres like 20 players on the team,  I think its safe to say the manager can just not suit up lol  agent_2:Haha that's a good point. Do you know what they call kickball in Canada agent_1:I read it but I dont remember lol  agent_2:Haha well they call it soccer-baseball, a very dumb name in my opinion LOL agent_1:maybe they should shorten it to like socball lol  sounds better to me.  agent_2:Lol that does sound a lot better actually. Can you imagine if you found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in your attic. I would probably have a heart attack agent_1:i would go on vacations!  Like a really nice one,  then save or invest the rest.  I wish my family collected something cool like that.   agent_2:Yep I agree. Did you know that baseball is super popular in Japan? agent_1:who wouldve thought!   agent_2:I know right. I guess a lot of Japanese are confused in knowing that it is America's national pastime. but we created the game so that's why it's so weird haha agent_1:Yeah really.  Do you watch game of thrones? agent_2:I do like Game of Thrones. What about you? I can't wait for the new season to start in April	agent_1:seriously!!!

3868	agent_1:Hello, did you know the dodo bird is actual a sub-family of the pigeon. agent_2:I didn't know that- of course I believe the bird is extinct, isn't it?  This year we recently had a bunch of hummingbirds..that was a first for me and so exciting. SO TINY.. agent_1:I also find it interesting that some birds can fly from alaska to north america without sleeping when they migrate. agent_2:Birds are very interesting because of a lot of facts.  I think it helps with their flight that their bones are hollow so not weighed down.  agent_1:Yes, they are interesting. I did not know that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. I find that very interersting. agent_2:I have watched them pull some to make them nearby.  The way they flit about is so beautiful to watch.  It is almost elegant like a dance. ..performing art! agent_1:Yes, did you know that Jackie Chan manages a k-pop band. I did not know that but i think it's cool. agent_2:It seems that so many you wouldn't think to have other interests do.  Jackie in music, Bruce Lee in dancing.  A championship even! agent_1:It seems to be in a kpop band you have to be tough because they go through bootcamps before being signed. agent_2:Boot camps for bands.. Guess it takes a lot of stamina for the dancing and singing.  Kind of the same I would assume for figure skating.  Can you imagine the work to land a triple axel? agent_1:That is true. It looks hard. Did you know babies spontaneously dance when they hear music. They are cute. agent_2:Music is a wonderful thing, so much to come out of it.  Symbiotic relationship with dance and music. Tupac was able to do both- never would have thought ballet for him though. agent_1:Yes, that definitely does not fit his image. I was surprised that ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week. That is a lot. agent_2:The tip starts to break down and doesn't hold form.  Same with skates, have to keep them sharp or can't get the edge for spins and jumps. Would have to assume that Nagasu goes through a lot of skates for this reason. agent_1:I like that she wanted to do the triple axel so bad that she dreamed she could . That shows heart for wanting to do something. agent_2:Especially when she had been passed over for the previous Olympics.  Rippon omitted his quad jump at the start, not as much heart I guess. agent_1:And she is part of the record books for being the first U.S. lady to land triple axel in olympic competition.	agent_2:She had her wish of making America proud.

What do you like? agent_1:I like most types of entertainment designed to give pleasure and delight such as storytelling, music, drama, and etc. However, I too like Steven Spielberg's movies. agent_2:Entertainment definitely takes all forms.  Back in 50bc people in Britain bred chickens for entertainment. agent_1:I wonder if that has anything to do with the mass produced meaty chickens of today? Personally I spent a lot of time with the Nintendo entertainment systems. agent_2:I like Nintendo too.  I don't care that the NES could only display 54 colors. It's enough. agent_1:Too bad it was finally discontinued in 2003, but it has had a long run. Aside from the NES, I also watched Bill nye the science guy when I was younger too	agent_2:I watch him now with the Planetary Society.

3445	agent_1:hi how are you? do you like sports? agent_2:I'm doing very well, thanks. I love sports agent_1:do you like golf? i have never played golf. agent_2:I love golf. Its a great sport where individual players hit balls with clubs into a series of holes on a golf course in as few strokes as possible. agent_1:I never played because it looked expensive. How long have you played? agent_2:I have been playing for about 10 years now and another thing I wanted to mention that the golf course consists of 18 holes but if you play the game for fun its usually 9 holes. agent_1:Ok, but doesnt it cost a lot for the equipment and the greens fees and stuff? agent_2:Well that depends on the equipment you buy and also where you play. agent_1:I guess i would want the cheapest stuff. i played sports with minimal equipment growing up. agent_2:The gold course requires a lot of water to maintain about 312,000 gallons in fact per day. agent_1:That sounds like quite a bit. it is ok in some places, but maybe where water is scarce, it is not ideal. agent_2:This is just the average for American golf courses. I read somewhere that a golf course in Dubai requires 4,000,000 gallons of water per day to maintain. agent_1:That is insane. in a desert country? it seems excessive, but i guess that the rich have the money for that kind of hobby. agent_2:I agree. Do you know any famous baseball player that is also a very famous golfer? agent_1:Is this a recent player? i know that a lot of them play gofl. agent_2:No this baseball player was back in the 1920s. agent_1:The babe? Did he play golf? He could hit a ball pretty fall. agent_2:You guessed it correctly. Babe Ruth, he was a fantastic baseball player and at one point America's most famous golfer. agent_1:That is amazing. he was a big fellow though. i bet he could drive it pretty far. Anyway, great chat! agent_2:Yes he was. It was nice chatting with you as well. Have a nice night!!! agent_1:You too!

4816	"agent_1:How familiar are you with the hunting and gathering culture people used to have? agent_2:Not too familiar,      Although I've read a bit from researcher Nicole Kruspe discussing odor. agent_1:Although our sense of smell may not be as developed as some species, odor played an essential role in our survival. However, odor is unique in that people don't name the specific odor itself, but rather what it reminds us of. agent_2:Interesting.   Western scholars dismissed scents as unknowable, or at least unnameable for millenia. agent_1:True, but recent studies by Majid found that the Jahai, who are hunter gatherers still, are able to identify these odors by abstract names. It seems that these hunter gathers & horticulturalists can identify odors, unlike the rest of their world due to their unique cirucmstances. agent_2:True, Kruspe and Majid propose that, when people settle into, say, horticulture or postindustrial society, other senses become relatively more important than smell.  agent_1:McGann states that this ability to distinguish the differences in odor receptors would play a greater role in a more natural, wild environment than the secure urban areas that most horicultural people live. While distinquishing complex smells may save a hunter/gather's life in the wild, it would be as much a life or death situation in most instances in an urban setting. In fact, simple odors like smelling sulfur are enough for most people to avoid dangerous situations. agent_2:Did you know that Humans (taxonomically, Homo sapiens) are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina. agent_1:I recently read that the defining characteristics of Hominina are bipedal locomotion, high dexterity, complex brains, and complex language. agent_2:Early hominins‚ particularly the australopithecines, whose brains and anatomy are in many ways more similar to ancestral non-human apes‚ are less often referred to as ""human."" agent_1:True, but because evolutionary development is progressive, it is diffiult to define cleanly where it is apes stop being apes and became humans instead. Considering some of these early hominins were capable of using fire, displaying high intelligence, I believe they should still be consider humans or at least an early precusor. agent_2:True, they gave rise to anatomically modern Homo sapiens in Africa about 315,000 years ago agent_1:Rather than simply anatomy, I believe the social behaviors and communication is what distinguishes modern human. While most early hominins were capable of using tools, homo sapiens were able to use societys for protection and use their advance communication to capture even the most abstract of concepts for the exponential accumulation and spread of knowledge. agent_2:Did you know that If earth's entire history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds. agent_1:I only happened upon that information on a Did you know? video. What advantages do you believe allowed us to dominate within this small window in history? agent_2:Advantages that explain this evolutionary success include a relatively larger brain with a particularly well-developed neocortex, prefrontal cortex which enable high levels of abstract reasoning and language agent_1:Although early hominins have similar adaptations, what do you believe made us stand out and survive while the others didn't? agent_2:A silly one is that Humans are the only mammals that can't breathe and swallow at the same time agent_1:What purpose do you think this serves? Is it to seperate the lungs and stomach to prevent drowning or getting food in the lungs? agent_2:Perhaps so, although such adaptaptations would be more likely to occur as gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits came to land."	agent_1:Speaking of fish, I recently learned that it is negatively labeled as a parphyletic group and not a formal taxonoic group since the classification isn't as clear as perhaps mammals.	agent_2 likes animals. agent_1's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['animals', 'humans', 'drowning'].

I love how they have these applied arts programs to bring them balance and something different and meaningful to them. agent_1:I heard that since his time, Duke has grown to have 98 student arts groups. agent_2:That is really amazing, love this idea. they have so many more classes directed at the arts now more than ever which is awesome.  agent_1:I wonder how many programs are devoted to the acoustic piano? agent_2:I love the piano, but not sure how many programs are devoted to it. by aligning art making with research it makes for a much deeper learning experience though. agent_1:I am a fan too.    Odd that the modern piano has been around since roughly 1700!	agent_2:Right! L played years ago, and I also love poetry. Everyone should have a creative side they let out.

His newest album is called man of the Woods by the way agent_2:Wasn't is previous album FutureSex/LoveSounds in 2006?  What is the reason for the long dry spell? agent_1:Yeah I don't know. I think he just needed some time to get his bearings. I guess a lot of people think that his songs feel empty in this new release though agent_2:Thinking back, about the only thing I remember about Justin Timberlake is NippleGate in the 2004 Super Bowl.  From what I read, in the interim has broken into acting, gotten married and became a father.  Do people think his songs are ""empty"" because he has changed his style or do they think he has lost his musical bearing?  His major life changes may have changed his musical perspective. agent_1:Yes I think is you could alter your taste in music will change. What do you think about albums though? Who made your favorite album  agent_2:Pink Floyd ""The Wall"" is my favorite.  Did you know ""The Dark Side of the Moon"" is still one of the best selling albums after 40 years!  And yours? agent_1:Wow that's great! I also love Pink Floyd and I love Metallica, I know that my friend loves Linkin Park and they have a best selling album right now agent_2:I did not know that.  What I find interesting is the resurgence in vinyl LPs for audiophiles.  Most of my music is digital, except for some local Louisiana bands who never made it big.  I still have their vinyl albums and play them every now and then.  What do you think of NWA's Straight Outta Compton? agent_1:I think it's a great album! It's crazy that it went platinum without getting any AirPlay or without them doing a tour agent_2:Do you think that the movie by the same name had anything to do with it going platinum? agent_1:Yes I think it went platinum before the movie came out haha. Have you heard about the famous Japanese rappers though? They are twins and also 100 years old agent_2:That's hilarious!  But it shows the international reach of pop music.  I remember South Korean ""Gangnam Style"" was big here, I believe in 2012.  Did  you N. Korea has its own girl pop band?"	agent_1:No I didn't, I wonder if there are any good?

I heard Uranus rolls around the sun agent_2:URANUS? <chuckle> What a name! Yes, i wonder what is wrong with that planet besides its awkward name. agent_1:Right lol! imagine a planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at you, that is a real thing agent_2:that sounds like a terrible vacation. i would rather go that planet 455 light years away. agent_1:right, I heard about that planet, it can possible sustain life right?	agent_2:It might. we should get Elon to get some people headed toward the thing.	agent_1 likes space. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['space', 'planets', 'astronomy'].

It is said that you can burn more than 180 calories. Wow. Must be because of the adrenaline pumping? agent_2:Im going to watch a bunch then lol, I heard that if you see abstract art before a horror movie you will enjoy it more.  agent_1:Thats cool. You know the movie the Shining? Well, the little boy Danny didnt even know he was acting in a film till way later, that was a good idea i think because the Shining is super scary agent_2:I know! I also craped my pants when I watched it, I thought it was pretty good and Danny sold the part. How can you not know its a horror movie though. agent_1:He was so young so i guess he didnt see the scarier stuff. As i am thinking of horror , the movie Cats Eye came to mind. I love cats so i got the best of both in that movie..horror and cats..lol agent_2:I love cat too, I have one, I learn this fact lately that when it reaches 15 years of age they have span 10 of them sleeping. agent_1: Did you know there are over 70 breeds of cat and they are usually either indoor or feral. i had an indoor persian cat. She slept a lot too.. agent_2:I didnt know that, and what was the name of your cat mine is Camaleona. agent_1:My cat was Priscilla. Check this out !!! Once a physicist actually used his cat as a co author while writing a book , so he could write using first person and not be judged harshly agent_2:Thats a cute name, and I didnt know that, thats an interesting fact I heard that a town in Alaska has a cat as its mayor."	"agent_1:Lol. I bet if we used the search engine Google we could find lots of interesting facts and pictures of cats.

Did you know that Wreck-It-Ralph was took three decades to create? agent_2:Really, no, I did not know that.  That is crazy.  I did know that Frozen was directed by a women.  It was the first animated Disney film to do so. agent_1:That is awesome! Hopefully she didn't use any recycled frames from other Disney movies. agent_2:I was glad to hear that.  Also, the toy industry gets involved very early with Disney movies.  Usually before the film even begins production. agent_1:I bet. Did you hear about Mrs. Lambert? She passed away a few years ago.  agent_2:No, I did not here about that.  But I am a huge animal fan.  Did you know that dogs can have 1 of 12 different blood types? agent_1:Yeah, I did. I also heard that there are actually dog blood drives. agent_2:I heard that also.  That is great.  Dogs can see color, just not as many as humans can.  A lot of people think they are color blind but are not. agent_1:That's good. Dogs are pretty amazing. I especially love how they are attuned to human behavior.   agent_2:I wish the US was like Istanbul.  They have a vending machine for dogs that will release food and water for the strays in the city in exchange for recycled plastic bottles.  agent_1:That would be great. Maybe since Google is a dog company, they'll start something like that.  agent_2:I am more of a cat person.  I have 5 indoor cats.  I remember reading that Google actually says in there code of conduct that they are a dog company.   agent_1:I don't really like cats.  agent_2:We are DONE talking, lol.  Speaking of hockey, Canada scored 132 goals and only let in 3 during the entire 1924 winter olympic games.  That was the first Winter Olympics by the way. agent_1:Lol.

Usually around playoffs. Did the Nationals make a mistake? agent_2:I don't think so, they weren't doing too good in the standings plus they're stadium was half empty agent_1:I guess it was time to make a change, maybe rebuild. agent_2:Yea they weren't doing too good, they were in third place in their division behind the Phillies agent_1:I think it's tough to the lineup just right. Too many variables, and the team needs to gel as well. agent_2:Yea and the fans weren't too happy with trading Daniel Murphy, guess he was a fan favorite agent_1:Did he sell enough tickets though? Probably most fans would want a winning team.  agent_2:Probably, they can always let their baseball manager play as they are technically allowed to play agent_1:That's a funny rule, isn't it. It must be a holdover from early days when a player also served as manager. agent_2:Yea, I remember back in the 1970s when Pete Rose was a manager he would sometimes play in the games too agent_1:Pete really was a competitive guy. He also bet against his team sometimes though.  agent_2:Yea that's not good. I have old Pete Rose baseball cards but they're not worth 3 million like the cards a man found in his grandfather's attic agent_1:That guy must not have been able to believe his luck. I wonder what he did with the cards. I would have sold half and kept half. Money now, plus a long-term investment. agent_2:I'd take a trip to Japan where baseball is also very popular agent_1:The baseball there is just not as good as in the US. Still, it's a difference experience at the stadium. It's an interesting lesson in cultural difference. agent_2:I'd like to visit England too, it's funny how until 1998 their politicians had to wear a top hat in the house of commons	agent_1:I guess rules get held over for the sake of tradition.

So do you like fish at all? agent_2:I do. They are so unique. It's cool that saltwater fish drink through their moths. agent_1:It is cool. The black swallower fish can eat prey ten times its own weight and twice its own length. agent_2:That is incredible! The only fish without a neck is a seahorse. agent_1:I think the seahorse is the only fish with a neck. Lol. I heard about a breed of jellyfish that is immortal. agent_2:Kind of males me wish to be a jellyfish! Zebra fish carry counterparts to human disease in 84% of their genes. agent_1:I bet we could use them to study diseases related to humans then. agent_2:I bet you're right. Freshwater fish drink through their skin via osmosis. agent_1:That is really interesting.

Well, maybe I used to. agent_1:There is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans! That seems weird... agent_2:I think it's 13 hertz, very low, below our threshold of hearing. Causes fear because I think it's like an earthquake sound. agent_1:Reallly??? That's impressive knowledge! Do you know anything about ribs agent_2:I've read that they grow back stronger after they get broken, but I haven't tested that out myself. agent_1:Yeah. I know if you smoke them with BBQ sauce for 2 hours on 180 they are delicious... agent_2:That a good tip, but they probably won't heal well after that.  agent_1:No, I am not good for the healing portion of ribs. I am on the other side of the healing line. I wonder how many ribs a black swallower fish can eat... agent_2:Times times their weight? They would get kicked out of the smorgasbord. agent_1:Yeah!

Do you remember their version of the Daily show from 2007? Man, it was terrible. Really, really terrible. It was canceled after 13 episodes.  agent_1:with Jon Stewart? the one on Comedy Central? agent_2:Yeah, fox tried to copy it with their own show called the Half Hour News Hour.  agent_1:oh I thought you were saying The Daily Show was bad and got cancelled! yea Fox should not have copied that show. Did you know Fox News and IGN are owned by the same company? agent_2:I did not know that. But I'm sure Rupert Murdoch owns dozens of companies I don't know about. Another thing I didn't know -- Hillary Clinton was the president of the You ng Republicans in college.  agent_1:wow! her views sure have shifted a lot since then, huh/ agent_2:I'd say. Nixon actually proposed a guaranteed minimum wage, the only president to ever do so.  agent_1:which surprises me , I always thought that that was something that pretty much everyone had touched upon in their time in office at least a little bit agent_2:Yeah, I was surprised too. Another surprising fact: Tea Party/GOP poster child Ayn Rand was on Social Security and Medicare.  agent_1:wow. I never cared for her books, did you? agent_2:No. Couldn't even finish the one I started. Canada's first official currency was playing cards!

There is also a draft for congress. agent_1:Type of people participate in these things? I think it would be boring. A single fold in the brain makes a difference between perceiving reality and fantasy. agent_2:Have you ever heard of terry pratchett agent_1:Yeah I think so I can't believe he was knighted for services to literature. He must have made some great contributions. agent_2:He really has. What an honor as well. agent_1:Yeah he must've been so proud. There was once a janitor from Chicago who wrote over six years of fantasy manuscript. He must've really been into it. agent_2:Yeah that is a long time to write something. He must have been really devoted. agent_1:Agreed. I bet he would've love to work for Disney. Bill Nye actually work for Disney as a consultant for Disney's flubber. agent_2:really. Thats cool. I always liked bill nye agent_1:Yeah he seems like a good guy. The Disney character Minnie mouse's name is short for Minerva mouse. agent_2:I heard that actually.	agent_1:Yeah I think it's interesting I never knew it.

So does Clint Eastwood apparently. agent_2:Yeah, he plays piano. he also composes too, ive heard. agent_1:I didn't know that. That is pretty cool.  agent_2:He is allergic to horses, i think, so maybe he spends more time at the piano now. agent_1:Interesting, I wonder how he shot all of those films then?  agent_2:I think he wasnt allergic at first, but then developed an allergy. maybe he is getting treatment now? i dont know agent_1:Interesting. Who would have guessed?  agent_2:I wonder if clint knows that Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts. agent_1:I'm not sure, but that is a good question. Do you like hats?  agent_2:hats are good. stylish, functional. i dont wear them often. You? agent_1:Nah, I think they promote baldness. LOL agent_2:good thing i dont wear them then. LOL.

I would have thought the cowboy hat myself.  agent_2:Yeah, maybe that is a working hat and people wanted to be stylish? i dont know.  agent_1:I'm not sure to be honest. There was a law in 1908 that limited the length of hairpins.  agent_2:boy, those women and their hairpins! LETHAL!

He did a good job adapting Martin's fantasy novels into a tv series. agent_2:George R. R. Martin is one of my favorite writters as well, I didnt know the show was filmed in Ireland, the country has beutiful landscapes agent_1:They did a good job worldbuilding and making a somewhat medieval setting agent_2:Yeah and also picking up the cast, like Harry Lloyd, he is a decendant of Dickens agent_1:Ya an talisa maegyr is played by charlie chaplin's granddaughter agent_2:A lot of talent in the show, there is a natgeo show called Game of Lions, seems like a fun show to watch lol agent_1:Well another good decision aside from the scene the director made is to film it in ireland. They actually get financed by ireland since the film would encourage tourism agent_2:I wonder if that strategy works for the country, I guess it does since many people around the world watch the show agent_1:I'm sure it does. Which arcs did you enjoy the most of got agent_2:I liked the second story arc, that one was amazing what about you? agent_1:I like the 3rd arc since it makes everything else pale and insignificant in comparison. Oh but I liked it when jeffry died agent_2:Yeah Jeffry had it coming, it was a fair death, he was a cruel boy and the actor was pretty good agent_1:Are you excited for the 8th season? agent_2:I am, too bad its going to be the final one but I guess the show will leave on a high note agent_1:Honestly, I have no clue how they are going to fit all the action and story into 1 season when it took 7 to get here. I just hope it doesn't feel rushed or left a a cliff hanger. In any case, since the 3rd arc focuses on the legendary dangers of the north threatening the known realm, there will be a battle to remember agent_2:Thats a sure thing, it will be a battle to remember and it feels rushed, theres a lot more the show can give us, I like how Arya acts as well, she has become a badass agent_1:I guess it is due to her success that the name Arya is rapidly becoming the popular girl baby name	agent_2:Its funny how a show can have an influence even on things like that one	agent_1 likes TV show. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics: ['TV show', 'worldbuilding', 'TV show'].

She apparently has a 11.4 million followers on Twitter. agent_1:That seems more assumable! She was also asked by the lapd to tweet them about some roadwork once! agent_2:Oh wow I have never heard of followers being used like that. Elton John chose Lady Gaga as his son's godmother. I didn't know they were close. agent_1:I didn't either! Do you remember the show boiling points on MTV? Lady gaga was on it before she was famous. 	agent_2:Yes I vaguely remember that show.

What about on the topic of horror movies again, that cat from Pet Sematary? Now that was a scary cat which wasnt valued for companionship any longer. Lol agent_2:Yeah, it was scary, I used google to get a better glance, I think google is a great company, has interesting apps."	agent_1:Yes Google is amazing.
