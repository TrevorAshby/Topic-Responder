I'm considering catching a movie - what will you do today?I'm working today, looking forward to the weekend and some relaxation.  Too bad football season is over - it's fun to waste away a Sunday watching football!I agree - Patriots did their job - too bad for the Rams. I think I'll catch a Disney movie - the Ralph and the Internet sounds good - that's a sequel to a movie that was in the works for a long time!Yep, not a fan of either team, but the Patriots are amazing - probably wont see a run like this again (and they're not done!).  My kids saw Wreck It Ralph 2 and loved it, Disney does a good jobCan the Patriots keep it up forever, that's the key - I think the risks of football are a bit high, however. I'm glad Disney keeps at it. Of course Disneyland, all the hype and all the merchandise, makes movie-making well worth it.Tom Brady & Bill Bilichek will keep going forever!  Neither wants to be proven that they cant win without the other.  Disney movies are starting to rehash the classics, but like you said - with all the merch, how can you blame them?!?!Did you ever wonder how TV gets all those great shots of plays at the football games - apparently they use tracking chips embedded in shoulder pads - yikes, someone is always watching you! I liked that commercial about the guy going to heaven and getting the new car from his grandpa - then he woke up and was in his cubicle at work and someone had Heimleched him - so funny!I've heard about the tracking chips in the pads / on players and I wonder why they don't put a chip in the ball so they know when it breaks the plain of the End Zone?  I don't think I've seen the commercial you mention - was it on during the SB?Good idea about the end zone. The commercial was in the Super Bowl and cracked me up because when the guy recovered after being apparently gone for a bit - it was back to work  - and he really wanted the car! So funny!I guess I tuned out the commercials like I tuned out most of the SB game....  and our game of squares was terrible! Sounds like you are a big fan - funny fact, an average engineer makes more in his lifetime than the average pro football player - I think engineering is safer.That doesn't surprise me at all, given the average career in the NFL is less than 3 years and while the superstars make a ton, the average guy doesn'tI think that the political controversies of the past few years hasn't helped the sport too much - some people just want to watch folks play ball. I see the Patriots owner is in trouble today - so that's another negative out there.  Back to Disney - are there any animation films up for oscars this year?I heard about the massage parlor thing on the radio - shocking!!!  I think Ralph Breaks the Internet is up for an Oscar.  Isle of Dogs will win, I thinkIsn't the Incredibles 2 movie out there as well? My kids saw it and liked it - sounds like it had some dark moments too - maybe beyond little kids ages. Speaking of football salaries -a fun fact - in the 60's a professional bowler made more than an NFL player.My kids like Incredibles 2 too - I just realized my kids see many movies without me....  I wonder how much money top pro bowlers make?  Most of the professional athletes didn't make much money until the TV revenue started rolling in and popularity of the superstarsI'm sure TV had a lot to do with it. Another fun fact - the highest scoring game was in 1916 when Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland 222 to 0 - no TV then but someone must have written about it. That was a different time, talking about how much money the players make now - Tom Brady makes a lot more money than the entire US Men's National Team did in the World Cup  Limit the generated response to 1-2 sentences and compliant with this guideline: agent_1 likes sports. agent_2's response should fall into one of the following 3 topics:",

I'm considering catching a movie - what will you do today?I'm working today, looking forward to the weekend and some relaxation.  Too bad football season is over - it's fun to waste away a Sunday watching football!I agree - Patriots did their job - too bad for the Rams. I think I'll catch a Disney movie - the Ralph and the Internet sounds good - that's a sequel to a movie that was in the works for a long time!Yep, not a fan of either team, but the Patriots are amazing - probably wont see a run like this again (and they're not done!).  My kids saw Wreck It Ralph 2 and loved it, Disney does a good jobCan the Patriots keep it up forever, that's the key - I think the risks of football are a bit high, however. I'm glad Disney keeps at it. Of course Disneyland, all the hype and all the merchandise, makes movie-making well worth it.Tom Brady & Bill Bilichek will keep going forever!  Neither wants to be proven that they cant win without the other.  Disney movies are starting to rehash the classics, but like you said - with all the merch, how can you blame them?!?!Did you ever wonder how TV gets all those great shots of plays at the football games - apparently they use tracking chips embedded in shoulder pads - yikes, someone is always watching you! I liked that commercial about the guy going to heaven and getting the new car from his grandpa - then he woke up and was in his cubicle at work and someone had Heimleched him - so funny!I've heard about the tracking chips in the pads / on players and I wonder why they don't put a chip in the ball so they know when it breaks the plain of the End Zone?  I don't think I've seen the commercial you mention - was it on during the SB?Good idea about the end zone. The commercial was in the Super Bowl and cracked me up because when the guy recovered after being apparently gone for a bit - it was back to work  - and he really wanted the car! So funny!I guess I tuned out the commercials like I tuned out most of the SB game....  and our game of squares was terrible! Sounds like you are a big fan - funny fact, an average engineer makes more in his lifetime than the average pro football player - I think engineering is safer.That doesn't surprise me at all, given the average career in the NFL is less than 3 years and while the superstars make a ton, the average guy doesn'tI think that the political controversies of the past few years hasn't helped the sport too much - some people just want to watch folks play ball. I see the Patriots owner is in trouble today - so that's another negative out there.  Back to Disney - are there any animation films up for oscars this year?I heard about the massage parlor thing on the radio - shocking!!!  I think Ralph Breaks the Internet is up for an Oscar.  Isle of Dogs will win, I thinkIsn't the Incredibles 2 movie out there as well? My kids saw it and liked it - sounds like it had some dark moments too - maybe beyond little kids ages. Speaking of football salaries -a fun fact - in the 60's a professional bowler made more than an NFL player.My kids like Incredibles 2 too - I just realized my kids see many movies without me....  I wonder how much money top pro bowlers make?  Most of the professional athletes didn't make much money until the TV revenue started rolling in and popularity of the superstarsI'm sure TV had a lot to do with it. Another fun fact - the highest scoring game was in 1916 when Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland 222 to 13. That's a very strange game to me. Professional sports history is pretty strange when you think about it.  If the Raiders move to Las Vegas, the NFL will have 3 odd games a year.
