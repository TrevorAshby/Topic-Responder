0,Are you a football fan?,yes, I'm. a football fan.
1,Did you now that the university of Iowa's visiting football teams locker room is painted pink?,Yes, I do.  I think they want to intimidate the visiting teams.
2,Something like that would just make me mad and geek my team up! You?,Yes, LOL. Do you know about ESPN winning an emmy?
3,Yes and that superimposed line made life a little easier, lol! Hard to believe that there are only 11 minutes of live game play.,Yes, what did they do the rest of the time?
4,I know right! Did you know that in the 60's top bowler made more than top nfl players?,I do.  They now make pennies compared to professional football players.
5,I would hope so, just goes to show how little the nfl paid back then. Do you know what the highest scoring football game was?,NFL or college football?
6,Think college back in the day when they wore those ridiculous helmets.,Cumberland was defeated by Georgia Tech. The scores were 222-0.  It was in 1916.
7,Yup and i know my hint helped, lol. Did you know in Austria they call football rugby?,Yes.  I wonder why though.  Do you know why?
8,Apparently the different variations are called football codes. It's called other things in other countries.,Green-Ellis, an RB, has never fumbled the ball in his NFL career.
9,Now that's an achievement. Do you know if he's in the hall of fame?,No, I do not think so other wise I would have heard.
10,Do you watch tv at all? It's just a mass medium for advertising, entertainment and news.,Yes, I do watch television once a day.  I like to watch national news.  I've got to run now.  Great chats!
11,Hello how are you doing?,Hello, I am doing great, you? Do you like football?
12,I love it. Did you know that top bowlers used to make more than football stars did?,I love it also! That is interesting, I wonder how much more football players make now than bowlers
13,I would say it is a whole lot  these days.,I agree lol. Did you know the first nfl playoff game was played in 1932 on an 80 yard field in chicago
14,thats amazing. Look what it has grown into. Billions of dollars in it. Millions and millions of fans. Its great.,Right! Now they even have chip technology in players should pads tracking data for them
15,That really is amazing technology. Did you know that Benjarvis green ellis has never fumbled in his career.,I heard that before, that is a great feat! He needs to teach a clinic to these new era RBs on how to hold on to the ball!
16,Well there had to be a touch of luck involved. He played for a long time.,for sure! I liked his name lol. Do you know the Lions coach Matt Patricia?
17,Yeah didnt he use to coach in new england,Yea the assistant, now coaches the Lions. The guy is a rocket scientist!
18,Really. I wonder if that helps him with football at all. Other than having a really good mind.,I was thinking the same thing. Do you watch college football at all?
19,Not really. I did hear that the University of Iowas visiting locker room is painted pink. I thought that was pretty funny.,That is true, I live down the street from that stadium. It is because pink has a natural calming effect on people who see it!
20,Yeah Im sure thats why. Lol.,For sure, maybe why they are good at home for football. It was very nice chatting with you!
21,Jerry Jones plays football.,He actually own the Dallas Cowboys. Apparently he has been pushing for an 18 game season.
22,Yeah, I thought he was a player, but he is the owner. I like the commercial with the two football players who make cupcakes.,Ha ha. Troy Aikman disagrees with expanding the season by two games on account of the players health and he has many supporters with the recent research regarding brain health. I agree with Troy.
23,Does mean sickness or injuries?,Injuries leading to brain damage over time. Jones has countered by saying they could shorten the pre-season by two games to even it out and it would be even safer. But I disagree with that because teams are more careful with their players in pre-season for fear of them being injured for the actual season when it counts.
24,I don't know. CTE is dangerous, but they can't diagnosis it officially until someone is dead due to the way the test is performed on the brain,,True but they seem to be finding at least some degree of it in the majority of autopsies they have performed. Jones also cited more money as a reason to extend the season which I believe is his only real motivation. I find that upsetting when he has to have more money than he could possibly spend at this point. It's very greedy.
25,It's greedy and dangerous,That's true. It seems to damage their impulse control. He says the players would make more but there is no guarantee of that and I don't think it's worth their health. They are already making a staggering amount of money.
26,I think it won't pass. NFL is a big corporation.,I don't think it will either. Did you know that the average football game only has 11 minutes of actual live game play! I knew that they felt way too full of commercials and interruptions.
27,Yes, the commercials make a lot of money.,Yes, that is a prime advertising time. I do not like the way they treat their cheerleaders. Saints cheerleaders aren't even allowed to eat in the same restaurant as players and if a player enters and they are already eating, they have to stop eating and leave.
28,That's probably due to sexual harassment. There is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free.,Not sure because i also recently found out that the cheerleaders make nearly minimum wage which is ridiculous. That's interesting. I know those were the height of entertainment at one point but I wonder if they hold up now.
29,Radios are interesting. Jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an am radio.,That's pretty fascinating especially given the distance.
30,Yeah, I wonder if aliens listen to music.,I know we have sent music into space just in case.
31,I didn't know that. Hopefully soothing music.,It's been a while since I heard the list but I know there is some classical in there.
32,Hi there! Do you have a football team that you like?,Not really. I'm not into sports that much, but it's an interesting subject to me. Do you have a favorite team?
33,I do. I love football facts. I know former NFL'er Benjarvus Green-Ellis has never fumbled a football in his NFL career.,I guess recently discoveries have been made linking football to traumatic brain injury (obviously) but even worse, also degenerative brain disease and chronic encephalopathy! I'll be looking more into it, as I said, I'm interested :)
34,I believe it. It is a rough sport.,Absolutely! running back Larry Johnson is battling self destructive impulses and surely CTE. It seems unfair to me, to have a sport in which the players are suffering for the rest of their lives!
35,Wow. I had no idea of such issus. Hard to believe the NFL has no rules against females playing in the league as long as they can meet eligibility requirements.,Shake my head! And I was just reading about it and found out that in the 60's top  bowlers made twice as much as top football stars! We should all just go back to bowling! It's much safer :)
36,Far safer indeed! Amazing that the average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live game play.,Yeah that is amazing! I would think the average game play would be much longer. Hm. I wonder why! So, it's hard to believe women could play too, but they might not be as offended if they were playing against the university of Iowa who painted the visiting teams locker room pink! HA! Talk about good sportsmanship :)
37,No kidding! Did you know the NFL uses tracking chips to track player movement?,No I didn't! I hope they put the chips in say the shoes or helmets versus implanting them in the players bodies! The very idea of tracking chips scares me!
38,They put the chips in the players shoulder pads so they can track every move the player makes on the field.,Oh whew! Okay. that isn't sooo bad :) I wonder why the New Orleans Saints cheerleaders aren't allowed to eat at the same restaurant as any NFL player! I heard that if the cheerleader is eating at a restaurant and any player comes in, she has to leave! That's absurd!
39,Sounds sexist if you ask me. An engineer's average lifetime salary is higher than that of an NFL player. Not as exciting, but interesting.,Something tells me that being an engineer is much safer than being an NFL player. Hard to say which job would be more satisfying or more worthy of doing. Considering engineers get paid more, I'd go with that job!
40,I would agree. It is notable though that it is only a 17 week regular playing season for NFL teams.,Oh wow! If that is per year, I'd love to only work 4 months and 1 week a year. But I'm sure they have to practice and do other things, like media events throughout the year. So maybe I will look into being an engineer and put my football dreams behind me. Haha. Kidding of course :)
41,I would too. It was really nice chatting with you today!,Thanks! Same to you! I hope you have a wonderful day!
42,Goodbye!,Goodbye!
43,hi how are you? do you like sports?,Hi there, I'm good thank you.  I love sports!  How about you?
44,I like basketball and football. sometimes i get a chance to watch.,I used to be really into basketball when I was growing up, I still watch my favorite team though.  Do you know what the highest grossing basketball movie ever was?
45,I enjoyed playing when I was younger. I try to watch the finals. The highest grossing? What?,The top grossing basketball movie ever? It was Space Jam.  Did you hear there is another Space Jam in the works?
46,Another one? With LeBron? I guess that makes sense. the producers probably waited until another superstar appeared.,Yeah I think so, I think Lebron will be the star of the movie.
47,Yeah, he just makes so much money. endorsements, salary. it is amazing.,He sure does, I wonder if he is among the top grossing athletes around the world?
48,He makes so much money. I wonder when he'll retire. he is about 34 years old.,He is, and I don't think he will for another few years yet.  Do you follow the NFL at all?
49,I try to watch the super bowl, and maybe the playoffs.,Yeah I always watch the Super Bowl, I mostly follow my team.  The playoffs are always exciting as well.
50,I usually root for the underdog in the superbowl. i like to seem the long shot do well.,I think I usually do the same.  Did you there is a high school football stadium in Texas that seats 18,000?
51,In Texas? Im not surprised. football is a religion in texas.,Yeah they love football down there, especially high school football, I think they take it very seriously.
52,Yeah, the fans probably wanted a bigger stadium too. Anyway, great chat!,I guess it cost $60 million to make, wow. Yeah same to you it was fun chatting.
53,Have a good night!,Thank you, I hope you do too!
54,Do you watch the NFL?,I am a big fan of the NFL, how about you?
55,I am, but I don't like that there is only 11 minutes of gameplay.,It is sort of frustrating that there is so little actual gameplay. Sometimes it does not feel that way though.
56,yeah, did you know that an engineer on average makes more than an NFL player?,I know a lot of players have short careers so they don't make as much as the elite players in the league.
57,Interesting. Did you know that Iowa's locker rooms are painted pink for the visiting team?,I did not know that. I wonder if they think that will throw off the visiting team's performance?
58,I think it does,I don't see that playing a factor with teams these days. I would like to hear an opposing school talk about it
59,Yeah. Well, you are probably better off being an engineer than an NFL player.,I would imagine that being an engineer comes with a lot less health risks such as brain damage!
60,That is for sure! Did you know that in the 60s bowlers made more than football players?,I know some of the Philadelphia Eagles had to have offseason jobs in the 60s. That's how Chuck Bednarik earned the nickname "Concrete Charlie", he sold concrete when the season was over.
61,That's crazy, but I can believe it. Maybe they should have been bowlers?,I would be curious to know why bowlers were being paid so well then.
62,I suppose there were a lot of fans for bowlers. In 39 out of 50 states the highest paid state employee is a football or basketball coach.,I think it's pretty crazy that some of these coaches get paid so much. The schools could use that for better purposes.
63,Yeah, it must be a huge suck on the resources for students education.,I know they bring a lot of revenue in for schools and you want the best candidates for the job, but other professors must feel real cheated by those salaries.
64,Are you a football fan?,Yea I watch the nfl and a little college. I'm glad to see Danny Johnson made it onto the Redskins despite playing at Southern University
65,Yes!  Did you know that the University of Iowa painted their visitors locker room pink?,Yea, I guess Iowa was trying to psych out the visiting teams by painting the lockers pink
66,No doubt. lol  In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars of the day.  Times have sure changed since then.,Yea, Espn won an emmy for it's coverage of the NFL, it's never won an emmy for its bowling coverage
67,LOL  I love that superimposed line they created.,Yea, it's too bad there was not tv when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0, I'd love to see highlights of that
68,Talk about a blowout!,Yea, I wonder how much live gameplay that game had since the NFL averages 11 minutes
69,lol  Did you know that the NFL has no written rule that prevents females from playing?  Maybe we'll see one someday.  Maybe a kicker?,Possibly, I wonder if a female player was on the Saints if she would not be allowed to be in the same public places as the male players like the cheerleaders are
70,Isn't that an odd rule to have?  I don't get it.,Yea, the saints rules sounds really outdated and sexist
71,I agree.  What do you think of the tracking chips they are putting in the players shoulder pads and footballs?  They claim it's to track the players moves on the field and to track the velocity, etc. of the balls.,It's pretty interesting, I know in baseball people are making a big deal out of tracking ball speed and velocity
72,It's crazy.  I'm wondering with the chips in football could they be programmed so that say the chip in the ball is programmed to go to the the chip in the shoulder pad?  Seems kind of shady...,I guess so but it might be cool if they put chips in basketball, I'd love to know how much force Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's dunk had
73,I remember him!  He was famous for his hook shot and in college he dunked so much that they banned it for almost a decade!  it's been fun chatting with you!,Yea, I wonder I Jabbar ever coached, they are the highest paid employees in 39 of 50 states
74,Good morning! Do you like football?,Hey there. Yes I love football. I am sad that the NFL season is over.
75,I am too.  A 17 week regular season is just too short.,Yeah I agree especially with only 11 minutes of average gameplay per game.
76,They definitely should make that longer.  Say, I've heard that women can play if they want to and meet the requirements.  Do you think they should?,I think they should if they are good enough but they shouldn't if they are smart. It is such a brutal game. And they don't make all that much because of injuries.
77,Yeah, the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher than that of an nfl player and a mlb player.,Did you hear how the Saints cheerleaders can't interact with the players?
78,I think I have. Isn't that where if a cheerleader is in a restaurant and a player comes in she has to leave?,Yeah exactly. The NFL even tracks player movements using tracking chips!
79,You mean on the field right?,Yes on the field! They put it in their shoulder pads and also the football itself!
80,Wow!  I knew a little about the football but I had no idea they had chips on the players too.,Yeah no wonder they can get such good accurate stats!
81,You know you're right!  It does make sense when you think about it.  I wonder if they'll ever use those chips like nascar does their cars and be able to tell if players make touchdowns and first downs.,Good question. I also really like the yellow first down marker when watching games on tv. ESPN won an Emmy for that.
82,I like that too. It makes the game more intense and exciting when you see how far a team has to go to make the first down.,Agreed. I wonder if the NBA uses chips to track stats too? There is even a bball court on top of the USA Supreme Court building.
83,Hmm, I never thought about that.  If they don't, they should.  That bball court you're talking about by the way is called the highest court in the land.,Oh very cool. Wonder if anyone famous has played there? Kareem abul Jabbar used to have such a dominant dunk that it got banned in college!
84,Hello!,Hello, do you have good knowledge about football players?
85,I am not a huge fan of Football but I like Basketball....,Same! I like basketball. I am a big fan of the Golden State Warriors. How about you?
86,Cool, I am a big fan of Phoenix Suns ...my team!,Nice! Have you been to a game?
87,Yes, not too many but a few. How about you?,A few as well. I always go to the stadium early to receive bobbleheads of the basketball players.
88,That's awesome, I have a couple of those too but  bought them from a friend.,Awww man, I hope they are worth the price. Reading from the factual section 3, I agree that space jam is the highest-grossing basketball movie. Have you watched it?
89,I think I have but it has been a long time lol....I too think it is interesting that the us supreme court building has a basketball court on the top floor how cool is that!,That is cool. I guess they need some exercise after a hard day's work.
90,True! Basketball is definitely good exercise lol,Do you play?
91,I did back in school but not anymore. I play softball on a league though and its pretty fun, how about you do you play any sports?,It's been a while since I played a sport. I used to play basketball, but now it's all about tennis and badminton. Of course in this kind of weather is a no no.
92,Yea, I live in a warm climate so we play sports more in cooler weather when its 70s and 80s outside.,For sure, I bet. I am waiting until the sun comes up.
93,Have you ever played Football at all or ever had a team you like in the NFL?,Well, in middle school, but not a fan. I only like the 49ers. It is because of my relatives.
94,Oh, yeah...I only watch sometimes because of friends lol,It was nice talking to you. Happy New Year.
95,Hello,  do you like football?,i do like football sometimes, not all the time, but sometimes. you?
96,I watch a few games a year,  but I do not keep up with it at all.,i try to watch the playoffs, maybe the superbowl.
97,Thats cool.  Did you know the NFL has no written rule against female players?,I have heard that, but I don't think that women can qualitfy. It's a tough game
98,Yeah,  just depends on the woman.  I hear the NFL uses tracking chips on the players and football.,I would like to see a woman that could do that. I have no problem with that. If she can play, let her in. Put the tracking chips on her.
99,The average game play of a football game is 11 min!  It takes like 3 hours usually to see the whole event lol,those players spend a lot of time standing around and waiting. i figured that 11 minutes was a bit short, but now that i think about it, it sounds right.
100,lol yeah I know right!  So many time outs,  fouls,  huddles,  etc.,Yes, basketball is a sport that flows a lot more.
101,I agree,  a lot of consistant action.,Basketball was invented by a Canadian. A *canadian*
102,lol cool.  I hear the inventor of basketball is the only losing coach in the university of kansas history.  Ironic.,He really could not coach. i guess he knew how to create game, not play them.
103,yeah,  thats unfortunate.  I hope he gets royalties or something,  this game has blown up!  it generates so much money!,yes, it has. the college coaches make so much. it seems like a distortion of the purpose of college.
104,Yeah 39 out of 50 states the highest paid employee is the college basketball or football coach.,I wonder where this all going to lead. Soon the degree-granting aspect of college will become optional extra. Anyway, great chat!
105,I read a lot of Sports Illustrated. Im a big fan of the NFL,Interesting. I'm a space junkie, and I'm jel of the internet speed that the International Space Station has.
106,I heard its faster than ours here in the US. Is that true?,It sure is. It's weird that there are more automated software programs on the internet, than humans.
107,Maybe its trying to stop people from clicking links on the internet. It can be an addiction,Maybe, as egosurfing is very real. I've never looked myself up, though.
108,Do you you read the full terms when buying a product online? only 7% of people do,I do not. Are you a Snoop Dogg fan? He wrote a song for his son's football team. How cool is that?
109,That is pretty cool. I wonder if the song is longer than that the length of live game play in the NFL which is only 11 mins,I don't know. It's amazing that college football teams have 14 of the largest stadiums in the world. I would have thought those would belong to NFL teams.
110,They even have a pink visitors locker room located at Iowa!,That's funny. Surprisingly, the coaches of the military football teams, are the highest paid employees at the Department of Defense. Seems a little silly that they are worth more than the people who put their lives on the line to keep us safe.
111,In many states coaches are also the highest paid person,That's insane. So is the stadium in TX that cost 60 million...for a highschool team.
112,Was that all paid my taxes? You have to wonder,Who knows. It's a little disgusting to think that they spend so much money on a tracking chip that monitors players every move, and all the stats of a football, yet...we don't have those capabilities on cars.
113,Maybe its because the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are higher than that of a player. Got to learn how to keep them healthy,There is a rocket scientist who coaches in the NFL. Matt Patricia, ever heard of him?
114,I have! He coaches the lions. Thats a crazy career path for a person,His school's fight song has six digits of Pi in it, that would be a fun school to attend.
115,Thats funny,Thank you for chatting with me, have a wonderful day.
116,Hello, lets talk abut the NFL. Did you know that there is no written rule that women can not play?,Hi, yeah, I had heard that.  Wonder why one hasn't tried to play, yet?
117,if they meet the leagues's eligibility requirements they could play, I wonder what the requirements are.,Probably physically tougher than a lot would want to attempt.  A kicker would make a nice start, though!
118,The games seem so long while watching , but there is only 11 minutes of live game play on average,I feel your pain!  The last Super Bowl dragged on over three hours.  Too much standing around and other nonsense.  It should be streamlined and made faster.
119,Did you know that over a life time an engineer can make more money then an nfl player,Wow, that's interesting.  But, I guess that's an average player, not a Tom Brady type.  Do you have a favorite team?
120,Patriots are mine, what about you? Engineers can also make more then an mlb player over a lifetime,New England Patriots are my favorite team, also! Go Pats!
121,There are tracking chips that are located in player's shoulders pads to track them on the field,I read there are also chips placed in the balls that track various things, as well.  The NFL is getting so high tech, aren't they?
122,yes, Lets talk about the NBA next. Nike used to pay the fine for Jordan to wear Air Jordan's,I remember when they were banned when they first came out.  Nike had the money to pay all those fines, it didn't matter they made it all back from the exposure it gave them.  Everybody wanted a pair of Air Jordan's!
123,Tim duncan could have went straight to the NBA but decided to stay in college instead.,That was very smart of him to do.  Always good to have a fall back career, in case basketball doesn't work out.  The statistics are not good for the average player after leaving the game.  Within 5 years, most are bankrupt.
124,interesting, I dont think that will happen to Allen Iverson since he signed an endorsement deal with reebok paying him 32 million at age 55,He made one good deal!  I would like to have him negotiate for me! Lol
125,I agree, it also pays him 800,000 a year which sounds like a really good deal to me,Do you have a favorite basketball team?
126,It's almost superbowl time!! Did you know that the highest score in a football game was 222-0 in 1916? Georgia Tech did that!!! Pretty Impressive!,It is almost super bowl!!! I am so exited. Who are you rooting for
127,I don't really have a preference... just looking forward to a good game.. The NFL uses tracking chips inside the shoulder pads that track the player's moves...rotation, velocity, speed, all that's tracked!!,I will be using chips super bowl weekend too! I'm leaning towards doritos.... Di you know Steve Smith when he played?
128,No. I'm not familiar with him. I recently found out though that the NFL has no written rule against female players! As long as they meet requirements, they can play!! That's interesting!,Yeah. I am not sure I have the stomach to watch a woman play against some of those men.
129,Well, one thing for sure is she has to be able to hold her own to get out on the field. Players have to be mentally ready for the challenge, whether male or female...Its pretty demanding... and could lead to anxiety!,I wonder if she could eat at the same restauarants as the players. The Saints Cheerleaders cannot....
130,I know!! That's an odd rule. Being able to relax and enjoy good company might be what is needed to get rid of depression. Steve Smith probably could have used a little laughter and fun when he was struggling in 2014.,He has been in 2 or 3 known fights with team mates. He broke one of their jaws and he was out for like 8 weeks. I wonder if all the head collision has anything to do with it?
131,Could be!! He admits that the demons he fights are inside... but he's learning to cope with them and to understand things and seek help. That's a start!,Yeah. I worry about the mental health of these football players. A lot of pain and depression in the whole league.
132,Yes, I agree. Smith has some advice to anyone suffering from depression. He recommends asking for help! He wants to relay the message that they are not alone and there's help.,Most NFL teams have a psychologist on staff. I hope they reach out to them when they need it. I know a lot of players are retiring early...
133,yes they are... theysend powerful messages to fans everyday with the actions that they choose. Like Tim Duncan of the San Antonio Spurs... he chose going to college for four years over going into the NBA and making loot!,yeah. I am glad he didn't get hurt. It's always a fear of mine when people go back to college instead of the league.
134,absolutely... there's always the fear of missing an opportunity! They have to weigh their options closely when making life changing decisions, just like anyone else.,Most athletes are now being told to go pro to end their rookie contract a year earlier. It's that second contract that makes all the money.
135,Well, sometimes it pays not to listen so much but to take risks and go against the grain! Like Michael Jordan. When he first introduced Jordan's to the NBA, they were banned! Imagine that. But Mike kept wearing them anyway, faithfully, and NIKE had his back, they agreed to pay all fines!!,He's the one that put Nike on the map!
136,Absolutely!!! Well, its been nice talking to you!! I hope you enjoy the rest of your day!! Stay warm!! Goodbye!,You too!
137,hi, do you watch football?,I don't, but I do attend a Super Bowl party on the first Sunday of February.
138,Nice. did you know women can play if they want?,Yeah, if they met the eligibility requirements. I wonder if that will happen one day.
139,I hpe so, it would be interesting. do you know about that rule for new orleans cheerleaders?,Yeah, that seems pretty sexist. Even if the cheerleaders were already eating in that restaurant, they have to leave if the players want to eat there. I mean, I know players are more important to the game, but still.
140,yeah, it is so sexist, I do not see the point of it either,I am a woman and don't know if I'd want to play in the NFL even if I could. I'd rather be an engineer. Anyway, over a lifetime, engineers make more than the average NFL player.
141,Yeah and I am glad that is the case because engineers contribute more to the society,Right, though I am sure many engineers do watch NFL games to unwind! I am not too interested in football, perhaps because  there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay per game.
142,I know yet we are glued to the tv for so long to watch the entire thing,Yeah. Since ESPN created the superimposed yellow line it has helped out too. They won an emmy for that
143,that is crazy to win an award for that. did you know now they use chips on the padding of the players?,Yeah, and in footballs too. The sport of football has sure progressed a lot.
144,yeah for sure. do you watch much tv?,I don't watch that much. I like to watch comedy, light things. I heard that Jim Carrey doesn't make dramas anymore because he believes he should only play in movies that project positivity.
145,Well if that is what he prefers. did you ever watch House?,I did but I got bored of it. Apparently others did not since Hugh Laurie is the highest paid actor ever for tv drama.
146,yeah he made so much money off it, $700 000 per episode,Wow, that's awesome. I wonder what motivated him to become an actor. For Michael Caine, it was because all the prettiest girls at his school were in drama class.
147,How's it going, do you follow football? The redskins have a challenge ahead of them when they play the giants offense,I don't watch football much, but it does interest me some. Who do you think will win that football game?
148,Probably the Redskins, they have a great defense and the Giants qb has been playing badly,Don't Barkely and Beckham Jr. Play for the Giants, though? Or am I thinking of the wrong NFL team? They're in the news for being really good lately.
149,Yea Bekham and Barkley play for the giants but they were still 1-6.,I see. Which NFL team do you think has the best cheerleaders? I think they're pretty talented, too. And they have danger like the football players, too.
150,No idea, I feel bad for the Saints' cheerleader though, they can't be in the same place as the football player,I don't like how some NFL teams have strange rules like if the cheerleaders are at a restaurant and the football players show up the cheerleaders are expected to leave. Very strange.
151,Yea those rules on cheerleaders and players are outdated and sexist,lol those were the same rules you meant? It is very odd. I think it might have started because it would be too distracting for the cheerleaders and football players to have relationships together?
152,I don't think that's an issue on the professional level.,True. I think there's actually a music video made based off of that with football players and cheerleaders like that. I think it's interesting no females have played for the NFL.
153,Maybe there will be a female place kicker soon since there are no rules forbidding women from playing,That sounds like it would be reasonable. I think the average football game only has just over ten minutes of play. Think of how much time that leaves for commercials!
154,I guess that's a big reason Benjarvus Green-Ellis has never fumble the ball if he only actually plays less than 10 mins a game,Did you know that despite how much NFL players make that engineers make more in a lifetime?
155,That's pretty crazy, plus Engineers make more than MLB players too,I like now the NFL uses chips to track players and the ball. I wish I was the one who invented that or even the one to have the job analyzing the tracking of them. Seems interesting.
156,Yea,maybe one day they will combined the chips with the superimposed first down line ESPN made for some crazy tv viewing,That would be interesting Almost as interesting as how there's a University where they have the opposingfootball team's locker room painted pink. I'm gonna go watch some Netflix now. ttyl
157,Hi! Are you a fan of the NFL? I think it's hard to believe the average game is only 11 minutes long in terms of live gameplay!,Yeah...I like Alex Smith. He's gotten a raw deal in past, like with SF
158,True. But he seems to like what he sees with the Redskins as they're not like Washington teams of the past! Plus they don't like using the word drama too much!,Yeah, no hype. Can't hurt to have adrian peterson involved too
159,Agreed. So speaking of the NFL, do you think we'll ever see a female player drafted or signed? They can actually play as long as they meet the eligibility requirements!,I dunno...but I think that would make for quite a drama. Patrick Stewert would probably lecture about it
160,Ha! Maybe so! But I don't think anything could be more dramatic in football than if a Saints cheerleader is caught dining in the same restaurant as a Saints football player. I can't believe there haven't been any lawsuits filed over that misogynistic rule.,At this rate they'll probably insert tracking chips on their Cheerleaders.
161,Yeah, that would be crazy if they did! Those engineers are geniuses. With technology like that, no wonder they make more than the average lifetime earnings of both MLB and NFL players!,Yeah, you don't need to be a rocket scientist to play football. However, it might help. Lets see how things work out for Matt Patricia.
162,No kidding! It takes more physical talent it seems. Like Benjarvus Green-Ellis who's never fumbled the football in his entire pro career. Now that really takes talent!,That's why they make the big bucks. The highest paid people in the military are football coaches
163,Are they really? That is almost unbelievable! But I used to think a yellow first down line was unbelievable as well until ESPN pulled it off and even won an Emmy for it, which they rightfully deserved!,What unbelievable is that the QB with the most wins in Cleveland doesn't play for the Browns.
164,That is unbelievable and kind of funny! Ha! On another humorous note, did you know the University of Iowa's visiting football team's locker room is actually pink? That would drive me crazy if I was a visiting football player! Ha!,Well locker rooms are soap operas. They even have soap in them.
165,Ha! So true! And there's a lot of drama like soap operas as well. Speaking of drama, can you believe Michael Caine only became an actor because he said all the prettiest girls at his school were drama students? I should have taken drama then. Ha!,Well Joe Hamm taught Drama in High School. Ellie Kemper was his student.
166,It's a small world, isn't it? I can't believe Hugh Laurie of all people is the highest paid actor for tv dramas. He made $700k each House episode. That is insane!,A few more of those and he could afford a texas High School stadium...which cost $60M to build
167,Holy cow! I couldn't imagine a high school stadium costing that much to build! Well, I'm off to to visit this website that has thousands of classic radio dramas available to listen to for no charge. It was great chatting with you today! Have a great evening!,Take care.
168,hello.,Hi, do you like football ?
169,I love it. Im a Steeler fan. How about you.,I am  Red Skins fan, like the guy who won the contest at at Bucs game.
170,Oh. Well Im sorry to hear that lol.,I like what he did, I was force to wear a Bucs shirts, but underneath there was a RedSkins shirt with the number 47.
171,Thats funny. Did you know the Iowa university locker room for visiting team is painted pink.,No, I did not know that, why did they do this ?
172,I would say to pysch the other team out. Do you think it worked.,I don't know, pink, beside being feminine, is quite a neutral color. I would have chosen to decorate the locker with clowns if it was me.
173,Or like a bloody nightmare on the walls. Something crazy like that would be awesome.,I think I would be almost cheating. Do you like watching football on TV ?
174,No it would be funny. Cheating happens on the field. Lol.,Do you think that Georgia Tech cheated when they won 222- 00 against Cumberland ?
175,I think that is just crazy. How could that even happen.,Maybe it was their first game. Or they did not have even a team, so cobbled something with a group of somewhat fit students.
176,I dont follow what your saying.,Forget, it is too complicated, how would you feel if you won 222-00  ?
177,I would feel like a real jerk for running the score up so high, but I suppose I would feel accomplished about my ability to do it.,Me too, I would feel  a little proud, but if I injured myself during the game I would feel really bad, it was not worth it.
178,I would say if you are able to beat a team by that much. They are no match physicaly. It would probably be them who needs to be worried about injuries.,But people hurt themselves without the aid of the others team. Do you like the other kind of football, like soccer ?
179,Not really. I think people hurt themselves because they are giving extra effort because the other team is good.,There could be some rivalries between the players of the same team. But usually it happens in teams that are already struggling.
180,I wonder what interest Unicef has in reducing cell phone usage.,I heard they are donating a day of clean water for children in need for every minute you don't use your cell phone.
181,Yeah, I know. That's why I wondered what their interest was in reducing cell phone usage.,That I'm not sure, seems like other things could be given up that would help ease waste produced.
182,Yeah, and it's an agency concerned with children, so that's weird. I don't have a cell phone anyway, so I guess it's a moot point.,Speaking of phones, do you know why New York's area code is 212?
183,Yeah, they gave the lowest numbers to the cities with the highest populations so it would take less time to dial them on rotary phones. I guess NY was the biggest city at the time.,Good call, did you ever use one of those rotary phones?
184,Yeah, I'm that age LOL. I grew up with a rotary phone in my house. How about you?,Yeah same here, we didn't have one very long, but in my friend's basement we still had to use it for years, one buddy was always confused.
185,Unfortunately with all the automated phone menus these days it would be hard to get by with one any more.,Yeah it sure would, not many people own landline phones anymore, I'm assuming you still do correct?
186,Yeah I have to -- I live in a wireless dead zone, so I also get Internet access through a DSL connection.,Nice, how about tv, do you watch much NFL football during the season?
187,I don't have TV either. Not much of a sports fan anyhow. Do you?,Yeah, but I mainly just follow my local favorite team, they didn't do very well this season.
188,What team's your favorite?,I like the Packers, always have and will.  I used to love watching Brett Favre play. Did you know women can technically play?
189,No, I don't know much about their rules, but I guess they just assumed it was something understood when they wrote the rules -- and then society changed?,I think it would be very cool if a female player made a pro roster and played.  It would give hope to young fans out there.
190,Do you like football?,I do like it somewhat. I used to love the game but it's so expensive to get tickets now. How about  you? So you enjoy the game?
191,I do enjoy it and yeah tickets are expensive so I usually watch the games at homes with family and friends, did you watch the Superbowl?,Yes, I was pulling for the under-dog, but the Patriots are tough. What other kinds of 'football' sports have you ever seen?
192,I like to watch Rugby and soccer as well, rugby has a lot of different rules,I always am amazed that they don't get hurt more in rugby. I don't understand it but it is interesting especially when they get into those big huddles and push and shove!
193,Did you ever watch the player Benjarvus Green Ellis play?,No, who is that? A football player or a rugby player?
194,He is a former football players, used to play for the Patriots was a RB, well thing is he never fumbled a ball in his career,That's quite an accomplishment. I imagine a lot of quarter backs would love that stat! I think it's so funny that the University of Iowa painted their visiting team all pink. Pretty obvious psychological tactic!
195,That sounds like a really funny tactic lol, I guess the other teams are taken suprise by this, at least teams that dont know the locker rooms,Right! But why are we so caught up in a silly gender specific color! Since it's not against the rules, I assume some day there will be female players and then there may be lots of feminine things in a locker room! Ha.
196,I guess so, yeah, ESPN made a great contribution to the game with the yellow first down line,,Wow, yes! You forget how many innovations TV has brought to watching the game. Its funny that they won an emmy for it. I only think of emmys as acting awards.
197,Yeah me too but I guess the yellow first down line deserves the price, crazy how bowlers made more money and fooball players back in the 60s,That is funny. I bet that same thing isn't true today. NFL players make so much. Can't imagine that its even close to bowler's winnings now. TV has made a big difference in the game. Crazy that they actually only play for 11 minutes each game!
198,I agree tech has changed the game in some cases for worse but also for the better, did you know the players have chips embedded in their shoulders?,I guess that's how they get all those stats. I wonder if they will ever use those chips to determine whether a player steps out of bounds or actually crosses the goal line?
199,I bet they will in a future, the football also has tracking chips, all kinds of cool stats are taken out of them,So coaches who contest rulings, may be able to use those chips to get the calls reversed to their side?
200,Do you watch football a lot?,Hi, no I don't but I do sometimes. I think it is a great sport!
201,I am not too into it myself. Perhaps it's because there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay on average in each game.,Very true! It takes hours to watch lol, I think it's great that the nfl has no written rules against female players....
202,Yeah, I wonder if any women will ever meet the requirements. I just wish that people were more willing to watch women's professional sports.,Me too! I love women's sports! I think it's crazy that the New Orleans Saints Cheerleaders are never allowed to eat at the same restaurant while any NFL players are dining in!
203,Yeah, I wonder why that is. It's crazy how glorified football players are. In the 60s, top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars.,Wow, that is interesting, you would never think that could be true! I find it interesting too that the Nfl uses tracking chips in the players shoulder pads to record their moves on the field, I had no idea!
204,Yeah, it's interesting how much attention is put into technology in the NFL. Did you know ESPN won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow line?,Really? That's awesome, it is a good invention for sure. I didn't know the NFL  merged with the AFL way back in 1966, never knew that!
205,Football has progressed so much. I don't think we've seen a score as bad as the Cumberland football game in 1916 where they lost 0 to 222.,Wow, that is a high score! I think it's great that Everson Griffen spoke up about his mental health issues after he took time off from the Vikings and when he came back he spoke openly about it. I think their is such stigma about mental health that was brave of him!
206,Yeah, it seems like a lot of NFL players battle with depression, and some of them do not want to speak up about it. Steve Smith Sr. recently talked about battling depression as well. He's one of the toughest wide receivers.,I read about that too, more and more people are coming forward about it and I think it is a good thing. Also Brian Dawkins spoke about his depression during his Hall of Fame induction speech. Great men.
207,It must be hard to admit what he did.,He did and even other athletes have come forward about their struggles who play other sports as well, Even Michael Phelps came forward about his struggles.
208,Yeah, and Joe Barksdale not only came forward about suicide consideration but also about the abuse he suffered as a child.,Wow, that's amazing and brave of him to do, none of that can be easy to discuss but it helps others to seek treatment and we need that in America, NFLs Brandon Marshall has called it the civil rights issue of our era.
209,I agree. Griffen said that he got treatment and it was the right thing for him. Hopefully that makes others brave enough to seek treatment.,I think it already has among these athletes and hopefully this spreads the positivity to others to get help and suicide is not the answer. Very good thing these men who are looked at as invincible and strong can even have these issues...
210,Hi, do you have a favorite football team?,Good morning.  Yes, I do The New England Patriots.  How about you?
211,Same here and I can't believe the running back Benjarvus Green-Ellis has never fumbled the football not even once! That's no easy feat!,No, it's not.  I can't imagine the pressure he felt! Do you watch any Soccer?
212,Yeah that's immense stress! I do, sometimes, actually I think I only watch the World Cup, do you?,That's about how much I watch too.  I read somewhere that Snoop Dog wrote a fight song for his son's high school football team.  How cool is that?
213,That's pretty neat. I wonder how much game time the average high school football team has, it's got to be more than the NFL which only has 11 minutes of live gameplay!,I know that's true and so hard to believe.  That last Superbowl I watched was about 3 hours long.  I tell you, I was shocked to find out those humongous US flags at football stadiums weigh like 1100 pounds and cost about $50,000 to make!
214,Exactly, with only eleven minutes of game play and yet I devote an entire afternoon or evening to watching the games! They look very heavy but I didn't realize they were that expensive, has anyone ever tried to steal it?,IDK?  Probably be very hard to smuggle out weighing that much! lol I know NFL football is popular, but I had no idea college football was so popular, also.  14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums belong to American College football teams.
215,That's true too! Wow, do you have a favorite college football team? I wonder if the college cheerleaders are treated like the Saints cheerleaders where they are forbidden to eat in the presence of the football players!,Yes, my Alma Mater, University of Florida Gators.  Go Gators!  That's a weird rule they have, makes you wonder what happened to prompt that rule to be put in place?
216,Oh my goodness! I used to live in Jacksonville so I know what you're talking about! Exactly and how come no cheerleader has come out to speak up about it, maybe they want to avoid bad publicity but I think it's doing the exact opposite!,Me too! You know as big as NFL and college football are, there is a high school football stadium in Texas that seats 18,000 and cost $60 million to build.
217,I have never been to that stadium, I have been to a couple longhorns games but I don't think that stadium seats as many people as 18,000! So it's true, "everything's bigger in Texas", even stadiums!,Apparently, that is true! On a different note, do you own a car?
218,Yes, I do own a car and drive through the drive-thru of restaurants all the time, the drive-thru came about from McDonald's to accommodate soldiers who weren't allowed to get out of their cars while wearing their uniforms, that's a great invention!,Yeah, that was nice of Mcdonald's to do and it has revolutionized the fast food industry for sure. I just moved to Ohio, where it is cold and just found out it is illegal to warm my car up in the morning.  Isn't that crazy?
219,Wow, I didn't know that, so I guess car sellers can't advertise the cars come with remote start function!,It's useless up here.  I can't wait to get back to Florida.  I freeze every morning!
220,Daniel Snyder is a great business man although Im not sure if cutting links with his radio stations is the best choice,He seems to be... but he can't run an NFL franchise if you ask me!
221,Yeah I agree, the Redskins are an ordinary team, that could change under a better management, maybe he doesnt have the time,,LOL... he's a business man that owns a multimillion dollar franchise.  How is that an excuse?
222,Well maybe the radio stations take too much of his time and thats why he decided to cut them loose, do you listen to the radio anymore?,I am sure if someone can make a ventriliquist act be succesful on radio, then there is no excuse for him.  By the way can you please respond faster?  I don't have all day!
223,Ok sorry Im just a slow typer, there is a Canadian law that says that 40% of the music has to be Canadian,Yeah i saw that!  I wanna hear solar activity into sound  Thts cool!
224,That does sound cool, Jupiter also has storms that are so strong an AM frequency can pick them,Man... can you believe that the only president ever to have a PHD was Woodrow wilson, thats crazy!
225,That is crazy! the only one? at least we dont have pop stars running the country,And the last president to speak a foreign language was FDR... geez!
226,We should have better educated presidents, the nuclear football shouldnt be taken lightly, what are your thoughs on Trump?,He's fine.... i think all politicians are fake... he's probably the most real one we have had in a long time.
227,I see, well he sure is creating controversy in the white house, his guest house is larger than the white house that must be a really big house,I a, sure it is... it is for the president!  LOL  See snoop wrote a fight song for his HS?
228,I didnt catch that one, do you watch the chanel ESPN?,I used to, but i don't have cable anymore.
229,I see, well ESPN won an emmy because they created the yellow first down line in football,,WOW... that's awesome!   I love that yellow line!!!  See college stadiums are some of the biggest stadiums in the world?
230,Really? bigger than pro football stadiums? they must cost a lot of money to be built,Great chat... thanks for picking up the pace!
231,Hi, how are you?,Do you like the NFL?  I read the other day that the average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameaplay
232,I love the NFL. Only 11 minutes? The junípero serra high school jv football team recorded a historically bad season in which they failed to win a game or even score a touchdown yet they never attempted to start their backup quarterback. that backup quarterback they refused to start is 4 time super bowl champion tom brady.,wow that is crazy.  I also saw that the NFL has no written rule against female players
233,I am watching the Pats game now and there's the first female official working the post season, Sarah Thomas.,That is interesting.  I saw that the NFL uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move
234,I love chips. Hopefully Doritos... Alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that he entered university as a junior. the quarterback received his bachelor's degree in two years, and began working on a master's degree, before becoming the first overall pick in the 2005 nfl draft.,wow that sounds great.  I just saw that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an NFL player.  Maybe staying in school is good!
235,The circular huddle used in todays american football was created by paul d. hubbard, a deaf quarterback, so the other team could not read his hand signals.,oh well that is helpful for sure.  I saw something strange.  the new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any NFL player and if they are already dining and one walks in they are required to leave
236,Thats sexist.... Baker mayfield (quarterback, university of oklahoma) once considered quitting football to pursue full-time competitive gaming, and claims to be able to beat anyone at the university of oklahoma one-on-one in halo 3.,ha ha thats funny.  I saw that the university of Iowa's locker room for visiting football team is painted pink.
237,Speakking of football... Kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl,wow that is crazy that he is the only one.  Did you know that the highest score ever in a football game occured in 1916 when Georgia Tech defeated cumberland 222-0
238,You gotta pull the QB at 60-0, right?,I am not certain about that.  I saw that the ESPN won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the firsts down line for american football games
239,The nfl has no written rule against female players; women would in fact be allowed if they met the league's eligibility requirements.,that would be fun to see.  I saw that former patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis has never fumbled the football in his NFL career
240,The law firm...The average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player and an average mlb player.,yes, I think I've heard that before.  In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football starts
241,Do you ever keep up on Brett Favre since his retirement? Apparently he auditioned for Monday Night Football,oh wow didn't nkow that, did you know that the NFL has no rules against female players?
242,I guess it's one of those rules people don't know about since no one has done it. Another rule people likely don't know is that cheerleaders for the Saints aren,ya I don't like how they aren't allowed to eat with players, that seems like an outtdated rule and also really dumb
243,There might be a legitimate reason for that rule though. All the rules in the NFL make the 11 minutes of live gameplay seem longer than it really is,ya they definitely stretch taht over 2 hours sometimes, did you know the avg earnings of an engineer is more than that of an nfl playier?
244,I guess engineers make enough per year and have a longer career. Plus, then they're not at risk for injury. Still, a 17 week season wouldn't be terrible,thats true, thats lots of down time, are you aware of teh tracking chips the nfl uses?
245,I heard there's chips in the footballs and shoulder pads to keep track of speed and all the stats the diehard fans care about. It's pretty cool how that works,that is cool, hopefully they dont use those on the Saints cheerleaders, that would be creepy!
246,Very true! That's much more strange than the visitor's locker room for football at the University of Iowa being painted pink,ya that is weird, I wonder if that hurts or helps them, I think that would  make me play better haha
247,But still not as good as Rb Benjarvus Green-Ellis. In all his NFL career, he never fumbled the ball,haha true! crazy how popular bowling was in the 60s, the top bowlers made more than football players!
248,I wonder if television has changed that. ESPN might have had a hand in that like they did with the yellow line they created for the first down,good piont, can't believe the highest scoring football game was 222-0, thats a blowout!
249,I feel bad for Cumberland, but maybe that was a really good season for Georgia Tech,haha true, do you think Kellan Moore being left handed give him an advantage?
250,I've heard that left handed QB's throw with a reverse spin, so his teammates would have to get used to that. Maybe that's why he's the only lefty in the NFL,huh that is interesting, did you hear about how smart Alex Smith was in school?
251,Didn't he start college as a junior and even started on a master's degree before being drafted in the NFL? That takes a lot of dedication,oh ya, he could have done a lot even outside of the NFL
252,Hi, how are you? Are you a fan of sports?,Yea, I like the NFL., don't think Colt McCoy's signing with the Redskins was a good move
253,McCoy could have had better, you think? Where else?,I think Colt McCoy made out good, he gets to stay with coach Jay Gruden, I think the Redskins could of found someone better or paid less for him
254,Do the Skins have a choice? Will the talent come to the Skins? I figure they gotta compete hard for the best.,Well they did have Alex Smith and were on the way to the playoffs until he got injured and 32 year old McCoy started
255,Thems are the breaks. I figure that someway they can find a combo of RB and QB that will make the yardage to win.,Yea, I guess Gruden finds McCoy a great sideline presence
256,Gruden has lost my friends too much money. I think that he should pay them for all their losses. Maybe he should let women play on the team.,Well there is no rule in the NFL against women player, I'm sure they could be place kickers at least
257,I bet on the Skins they could play other positions. Maybe even coach. They could start with placekicker. I would bet on that.,I wonder if Gruden was the coach of Tom Brady's JV footbal team that failed to start him or win a game
258,That JV coach probably had a personality issue with Tom. Tom wouldn't eat his wife's strawberry shortcake or something.,Probably. Did you know Alex Smith started college as a Junior and was working on a masters before being drafted?
259,He was a genius! How many football players could do something like that? He must have been the smartest QB of his class.,On the other side of the spectrum Baker Mayfield was considering being a competitive gamer instead of a qb
260,I would totally go football. The cash, the women, the fame. No video games.,Yea, plus the average NFL game only has an average of 11 minutes of gameplay
261,That is insane. You can't get hours like that playing video games. Anyway, great chat!,You too, I think I'm going to watch some football on ESPN and enjoy the emmy winning Yellow line they invented
262,Yes, that line was a breakthrough. Like walking on the moon. Thanks!,Have a good one
263,I think that Jon Gruden is a sensible loss for the team,,What do you mean by sensible loss? I think John Gruden is a huge mistake for the team.
264,Well I think his a good player, hard to replace, thats what I meant or at least in The Raiders team his become an important piece for the coach,John Gruden is an NFL head coach. He's not a player. The 33-13 loss to the Rams was just the beginning of a miserable season. Are you familiar with the NFL?
265,Oh I see, I guess Im confusing him with a player of the team, what was his name I think it was Khalil Mack, and I do follow some games what about you?,Football is one of my favorite sports and I follow all 32 teams. Khalil Mack was traded to the Bears by John Gruden for some picks. They definitely felt his absence. I don't know why they didn't just resign him.
266,Maybe he demanded a high salary? what is your favorite NFL team?,I like the Giants best, you?. He did demand a high salary. He's the highest paid defensive player in the NFL. I guess the Raiders tied up too much money in Carr and Gruden.
267,I like the Patriots best and yeah thats probably the reason then, too much money but I mean he might be worth it, theres few players with his skills in the league.,Well congratulations on the Super Bowl. Did you know the average NFL game only has 11 minutes of game play? No wonder my girlfriend gets bored.
268,Thanks, it was a boring Superbowl but good thing the Patriots won that cheered me up, and no, I didn't know that so out of the 3 hours a game lasts only 11 minutes are of actual gameplay? Wow,Yeah who knew? It's quite an interesting game and a big business. They use tracking chips embedded in shoulder pads now to track players. They even have them inside footballs now.
269,Thats interesting indeed, I wonder how that has changed the game, I bet all kinds of interesting stats are available now because of that data,ESPN actually won an Emmy for the creation of the yellow line for 1st downs on TV. The power of technology.
270,I guess that did change the game forever, I think it's a well deserved award.,Do you follow any other kinds of football besides American football?
271,I like soccer as well, in fact is one of my favorite sports, I also like rugby, what about you?,I mostly just an American football guy. Interesting that Rugby is also considered a type of football
272,Yeah, rules are completely different but I guess there are some similarities.,Do you remember Benjarvus Green-Ellis? He was a RB on the Patriots.
273,Are you a fan of the NFL?,I definitely am.  Watching the Super Bowl has become a family tradition.  What about you?
274,The same I like watching both college and NFL. Do you have a favorite team?,For college, yes, but I don't have a specific rooting interest when it comes to the NFL.  I have a feeling I end up cheering on the American Football Conference in the Super Bowl more often than not.
275,True, me too. My favorite college team is the Iowa Hawkeyes, have you heard of them?,It just so happens I have.  I'm a Nebraska Cornhusker fan, which makes us rivals (even if the last several years haven't gone our way).  I bet when we are the road team it's those pink visitor locker rooms that are doing us in?
276,yikes lol. I think it does a lot of people in. I like Nebraska football too though, probably my second favorite big ten team. The pink is a calming effect.,Hats off to you for being able to like both teams.  I guess we were separated by conferences for a long time.  At least we never had any 222-0 type outcomes on either side.  Can you imagine what Cumberland must have felt in 1916 after Georgia Tech did that to them?
277,Right, I think I would have quit right after the game. Or maybe after it was 100-0 lol.,Considering I have never heard of Cumberland, maybe that was it for them?  Or maybe they lasted until the 1960s when, amazingly enough top bowlers were making twice what football players were.
278,I can't believe that, but I guess it was more popular at that time. I wonder what the pay difference is now.,I have no idea. I bet TV had a lot to do with the shift though.  Think about all the innovation in television have come through sports.  I couldn't imagine a game without the first down yellow line and have to remember that isn't actually on the field.  I give ESPN trouble, but all credit to them for that creation which earned them an Emmy.
279,I love the yellow line, I used to think it was real when I was younger, glad to know it was digital lol,Maybe ESPN's tech department is filled with brilliant folks like Alex Smith who got is degree in two years!
280,I think they are too. And the engineers do some crazy things. Have you heard about the tracking chips they use?,I know they invest a ton of money in the game, but I'd love to hear more about these chips.
281,They put them in footballs and shoulder pads to track velocity, speed, and how players move around the field. Probably made by the engineers who make more money during their lifetime than the players,It's a rough sport!  It's crazy to think that just 11 minutes or so of actual game play/hitting over the course of three hours can be so damaging.
282,Wow they take a lot of blows so that is good it is only that long! It was so nice chatting with you!,You as well!  Have a great evening!
283,do you like football?,I love it. Do you know what color is the U of Iowa visitor locker room?
284,Yes it is pink but I a not sure why they chose that color,I wonder if it is supposed to have some effect on them
285,I wonder too. Bowling was more popular than football in the 60s,Yes that is why bowlers made way more than them
286,Wow cool. Do you know what the highest score in college football is?,Yes that is 222-0 , do you know who played?
287,Yes it was Georgia Tech who beat Cumberland in 1916,Yes. Did you know ESPN won an Emmy once?
288,Yes they won it for the superimposed yellow line,Yes. Do you know Green-Ellis never fumbled the ball?
289,AMazing. Did you know that women can play in the NFL?,Yes there is no rule that says that they cannot play
290,Yes as long as they qualify they are good to go,Yeah. Did you know the average live gameplay is only 11 minutes?
291,Yes and yet we are glued to the tv forever,True. Engineers make more than football players over the lifetime
292,I guess it makes sense since they have longer careers too,True. WHat do you think of that rule for Saints cheerleaders?
293,Are you interested in football?,I am not. I watch it because I have a son who likes it. Also, I think the Saints are sexist with how they treat their cheerleaders, and the league should do something about it.
294,You're right! It's something about how cheerleaders and football players can't be in the same restaurant at the same time? That's crazy! I wonder what started that!,I don't know, but it must be frustrating to have to leave in the middle of your meal.
295,I was surprised to learn that there is no rule against female players being able to join a team. They just have to meat all the same eligibility points as the men. I think I saw an ad during the superbowl that featured a female player. Have you seen it?,I have not seen it, I don't watch the superbowl. I know there are a lot of girls who play in high school, many are kickers. I hope a woman decides to try out one day.
296,Something I just learned about football is that the circular huddle was invented by a deaf player who didn't want the other team to learn his ndigns,That's interesting. Especially since it is still in use today.  It's funny that the top bowlers used to make more than the top football players.
297,I wonder how much that was! Do you think they used to pay football players way less, bowlers more or both?,I don't know, it was back in the 60's. Then again, engineers make more than the average player these days
298,I think that's how it should be really. Engineers are actually vital at times, football players not so much. Did you know that there has only been one left handed quarterback in the NFL? Seems insane given the odds, right?,That does seem weird. I guess there is a RB for the Patriots who has never fumbled.
299,That's interesting, although I'm always suspicious of the Patriots after all that stuff about "deflategate",Nothing surprises me anymore. Although, with the Browns getting OBJ in trade, I'm thankful Baker Mayfield didn't quit football to become a pro gamer.
300,I can see the appeal, there's way less risk in gaming than in football and sometimes the money can be pretty similar, right?,Some of them make millions at one tournament. I guess he's pretty good at Halo 3, which is a hard game.
301,I know about as much about Halo as I do about football which isn't much! Haha Did you know that ESPN won an emmy for the creation of the fake yellow line they show on football broadcasts?,Wow. That must have been a bad year for Hollywood, if they won for that. Its funny when you realize that Tom Brady's highschool coach didn't want to play him.
302,I wonder what the reason could be for that? Do you think the coach was bad or he didn't like Brady personally?,Maybe he was that bad? lol, I know I shouldn't say that about a super bowl champ.
303,Ram's become the youngest head coach.,Thats really interesting. I wonder if that effects the next years team
304,Which is your favourite sports ?,I like the 49ers,  How about you?  I recently found out that the NFL uses tracking chips.
305,Super Bowl is my favourite. The 2019 NFL season will be the 100th of the National football league.,Wow thats great.  I prefer baseball than football though.  What do you like about football?
306,Yes. Football is the team sports that involves to kicking the ball in various degrees to score a goal.,Did you know there was only one left handed quarterback in the NFL?
307,Yes. The middle century is the greatest rises for football mainly in England. Many group of matches conduct between towns and so many clubs were formed.,That is interesting.  The left handed quarterback was named Kellan Moore.
308,It is very interesting. English Public School played the important role in the development of the football. The only organised the team and they teach the difference between Running and Carrying.,The huddle was created by a deaf quarterback.
309,In modern American football, the quarterback is usually considered the leader of the offensive team.,Yes,  he calls the shots basically.
310,Baker mayfield once considered quitting football to pursue full-time competitive gaming.,lol well professional gamers dont get injured as much,  I say go for it.
311,While playing injury is unavoidable. In training only we avoid it.,Yeah thats why I suggest professional gaming,  they dont get injured lol
312,Yes. It makes sense to protect  from injury it is very hard to lift the trophy.,Do you Alex smith?  he took so many ap tests in high school that he entered university as a jounior.
313,Yeah. It is very nice chatting with you. Have a great day.,Thanks you as well.
314,hi, do you watch football?,A bit but not regularly. I did see the beginning of the superbowl a few weeks ago, but I only have a passing knowledge of football
315,I see. do you know who reggie miller is?,Do you mean the basketball player on the hall of fame? Otherwise, I don't know a reggie miller in football
316,I meant to say alex smith, not sure why I was thinking of reggie.,I don't know much but I think he was a quarterback. Correct me if I'm wrong
317,yeah he is and he was so good in school he wrapped up a college degree in two years,Wow he must be brilliant or a very hard worker. I like quarterbacks since they lead the offense.
318,that is true. I think it is a bit of both. he took many ap tests, that's why,While I don't know much about alex, I tend to follow players like kellan moore who is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl
319,that is amazing, amongst so many players he is the only one,I mean I know it is inherently harder if you are left handed as a QB
320,yeah. and baker mayfield once considered quitting to become a competitive gamer,I also think Brady johnson is impressive as well since he has even thrown a touchdown pass to himself
321,that I would like to see. do you know who created the circular huddle?,I don't know his name, but I think he was deaf right? What is his name?
322,yeah he was deaf. his name was paul hubbard,In any case, I like following players like tom brady, brady jonson, and etc
323,They are all great players. did you know women can also play in the nfl,While there aren't any explicit rules against them, don't the requirements pretty much disqualify them anyway?
324,Do you like american football?,I do! I LOVE football!! Hard to believe the NFL is made up of 32 teams.
325,It is harder to believe the average game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay,That is crazy! I know the NFL uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field.
326,They even put them in the football itself,Oh wow! That is something. It must be to track ball velocity, rotation, ball speed and location.
327,I hope this data will help reduce the number of injuries to players,I do too! Did you know that the first NFL playoff game was played in 1932 on an 80 yard dirt field inside Chicago stadium, the then home to the Blackhawks.
328,What has happened to it now?,That I'm not sure of, but I know Chicago has changed a lot.
329,No doubt. Do you like any particular position?,I would say quarterback is one I know the most about. I know that only two african-american quarterbacks have won the Super Bowl.
330,I like tom brady. He is still a stellar athlete despite being around 40,He is. I agree. Did you know Kellan Moore is the only left-handed QB in the NFL?
331,Yes. He is definitely worth respecting since it is much harder to be left handed as a QB relatively to other sports,I can't even imagine. Superbowl winning quarterback, Brad Johnson is the only quarterback in history to throw the winning touchdown to himself!
332,I wonder how you would even throw the touchdown to yourself?,It had to be a recovered fumble. Did you know that QB Russell Wilson is still under contract for major league baseball?
333,Really?,Yes! He has not played since 2011.
334,How familiar are you with football and the nfl?,I don't follow pro football that much.  I was following the Saints (home team) when it looks like they were on track for another Super Bowl, but then got robbed of a victory.
335,But you do know that the nfl is among the top 4 major professional sports leagues in north america,Yes, it has a big draw, especially today when a lot of people are glued to their TVs for the Super Bowl.  What do you think of the quarterback match up: Patriots Brady (age 41) versus Rams Mannion (age 26)?
336,I think it is an interesting one, but personally rooting for Brady. I like the QB position the most since they are the core of the offense. Do you like any position in particular?,It is a battle of experience versus youth.  I am not set on any position, but it seems like in grade school football being QB was everyone's goal.  Did you know that the circular huddle was created by a deaf quarterback, Paul D. Hubbard, so the opposing team could not read his hand signals?
337,Yes, also kellan moor is the only left handed QB in the nfl. I wonder if that is a advantage or disadvantage.,I don't know, but doubt it.  A left handed hitter is a plus in pro baseball, but I can't see it mattering in football.  I tend to follow collegiate' s more, my alma mater LSU.  Did you know University of Iowa painted the visitor's locker room pink?  You got to wonder if it is intimidation, disrespect, good humor, or a combination of those?
338,I tend to follow players more than teams like green ellis who has never fumbled in his entire nfl career,I did too, Louisiana boy Terry Bradshaw, QB for the Steelers.  He is one of the reasons the Steelers have the most Super Bowl wins of any NFL team.  If you followed the NFL playoffs, you might have noticed that the NFL has a female ref, Sarah Thomas.  Do you think they will every have female players?
339,Well the nfl doesn't have any written rule against female players,We will have to wait and see.  Some of the traditions in football are peculiar, if not humorous.  For example, Saints chearleaders cannot be in the same resturant with any NFL player, even if they were there first.
340,I agree. However, I think there are some interesting things going on for the NFL, not just on the team level. For instance, they are putting chips into players shoulderpads and footballs to gather data and make better plays,I would have liked to have known the G forces the Saints receiver took in that "no call pass interference" play in the playoff game with the Rams.  What do you think of the salaries.  We know what the stars make, but not the backups and the 2nd string.  I wonder how the average salary with the short career span stacks up against other jobs?
341,Well the average lifetime earning of an engineer is higher than that of an nfl, but you have to remember as you pointed out the hour they work respectively.,They do earn more per hour playing, but it is a short career, often 10 years or less, while a good engineer would likely get 35-40 years of service.  You brought up the chips in shoulder pads, but other techs have also changed the game, or at least how it is viewed.  Did you know ESPN won an Emmy for the TV yellow line showing the first down position?
342,Well the yellow line definitely helped many viewers better digest the situation and action on the field,I agree.  With the yellow line, you can really visualize how far they need to move the ball.   It also lets the armchair QBs speculate on what plays the real QBs will call.  Most of these guys are really smart.  Did you know QB Alex Smith entered college as a Junior and was working on a Masters when he entered the NFL draft?
343,I agree that most of these guys are brilliant. I mean the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay, but so much goes on in those few minutes that the espn won an emmy for helping to break it down and these players have to make the smart decision in fractions of seconds,I agree, but they also have coach to QB communications in the QB's helmet these days.  What I really don't like is when the QB is a prima donna.    They need great backs and receivers.  Like Benjarvus Green-Ellis who never fumbled in his NFL career.
344,I agree. In any case, I enjoy our chat about football. Thank you,Same to you.  I guess I will go man the grill for our half time feast.
345,hey did you know that the NFL has no rule against having female players?,I was not aware of that. I'm surprised because they do have some sexist policies. Do you know about their rules regarding Saints cheerleaders?
346,I haven't heard about that, what are the rules?,They are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant with players. If a player enters and they are already sitting and eating they have to get up and leave.
347,oh weird why do you think that is? it seems very silly to me,I don't know but I find it upsetting. It seems completely unreasonable. Did you know that the average gameplay time in a game is 11 minutes?!
348,I didn't know that, are you going to watch the Superbowl tomorrow? It's always several hours long yet like you said theres only 11 mins of gameplay, that's silly!,I am but I'm just using it as an excuse to eat bad food ha ha. Were you aware that players and footballs have tracking chips in them to record their every move?
349,no I didn't know that, I hope they don't adopt that into regular people to watch our every move, that would suck!,Me either. I wonder why they don't use that for plays instead of just reviews?
350,ya that'ss true, also crazy is that the earnings of an engineer over his lifetime is more than the average NFL player, Crazy!,That is shocking to me. I'm sure they leave with way less medical issues also. I was shocked when I learned that in the 60's bowlers made more than football players!
351,that is crazy! I can't believe the highest scoring football game was 222-0, like wouldn't you stop once you got to 100-0 haha,I do not understand how that is even possible. Are you familiar with RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis?
352,no I'm not, what is he famous for? I don't watch sports personally,He never fumbled the football once in his whole career which is astonishing.
353,that is crazy I'd give that guy the ball all the time! I guess Alex Smith plays quarterback and had a lot of good grades on his AP test, it's kind of like he's wasting his brain talent on football haha,Well he was badly injured and I doubt he comes back so I'm sure his intelligence will get him somewhere else. I believe he was already working on his Master's when drafted.
354,ah interesting I didn't know that, also I didn't know that ESPN won an emmy for developing the yellow line that we see in every football game on the first down line,I can't believe that was so recent. I can't imagine watching a game without that line.
355,Do you watch football?,I sure do. Did you know that women can play on the NFL?
356,I heard that, I wonder if there is any chance it will happen soon, what do you think,I have no idea but it is good that if they qualify they have that option to play
357,I think there may be a kicker in college that has the chance in a couple years. We will have to wait and see. Do you have a favorite team?,I do not but I enjoy watching the games even though there are only 11 minutes of gameplay altogether
358,That is so small of an amount. You figure it would be more, the games last like 3 hours lol,I know we are glued tot he TV for what feels like forever
359,for sure lol. I am an Iowa Hawkeye fan, do  you know them?,I cannot say that I do for sure. Did you know that engineers make more over their lifetime than football players?
360,They paint their locker rooms pink for the opposing team. Pink has a natural calming look. Those engineers probably developed chips that players use in their shoulder pads.,Yeah they seem to be collecting lots of info with those chips like velocity and rotation and such
361,I agree, I bet they get so much good data from it. Did you know in 1960 top bowlers made more money than nfl players,Wow that is mind blowing. I wonder if they they can use that data in any way to make the game safer too
362,I bet they do. I wish they had chips in the helmets to track blows to the head and what they do. Maybe that will be next,I hope so. DO you know that ESPN won an EMmy once and if so, what for?
363,I never heard about that, what was it for?,It was for the superimposed yellow line, pretty cool
364,Wow, that is awesome and it is so helpful. I always thought it was real growing up lol. It was so nice chatting with you!,Same here and hope you have a great one.
365,hi, do you watch nfl?,Hi, how are you? Sometimes.
366,did you know women can play too?,I think that there could be women at certain positions, like kicker. Women would probably draw a lot of interest, increase the TV audience.
367,yeah and make it more interesting as a sport. did you know an average game only has 11 minutes of playtime,On a per-minute basis, they make a great wage. Did you know that there is only one left-handed quarterback in the NFL? Kellan Moore. I'm surprised. I thought there would have been more, considering the number of lefty pitchers in the MLB.
368,Yeah exactly. do you know about that weird rule for the new orleans cheerleaders?,They can't be in the same restaurant as the players. Not cool.
369,Not cool at all. worse, they have to leave if the player walks in mid meal,Probably not the same for high school football, though. Funny story: The Junipero Serra high school had a season in which they didn't win a game or even score a touchdown. Nevertheless, they never started their backup QB, Tom Brady. And, as a sarcastic comment, we all know what a loser he was.
370,My godness their loss. did you know now they put tracking chips on their padding?,That makes sense. Helps with strategy. The highest score ever in a football game was in 1916: Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0. What was the spread on that game, I wonder.
371,That is a huge difference. Did you know espn won an emmy?,I heard. For that yellow line. Hm. Probably a weak year for awards.
372,Yeah I think so too. Did you know there is a player than never fumbled the football in his career?,Hard to believe, but I guess it had to happen eventually. In the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars. Still, I wonder how much bowlers made overall. Was it that much money?
373,I do not think so, I just think football players were not paid too much then,The college game seems to be a bit silly in some ways. The University of Iowa tries to use cheesy psychology on the other team. They pained the visitor's locker room completely pink. I wonder whether that works at all. Why wouldn't other teams do it as well?
374,That is curious. do you know benjarvus green-ellis?,No, never met the guy.
375,He is the only football player to have never fumbled in his career,Well, it's been fun talking with you! Have a great evening! Enjoy the football!
376,Hi, how are you today?,Good morning!  Doing well!  Are you much of a NLF fan?
377,Friend, I tell you I feel like I have had football on the brain for the past couple of weeks!  Yes, I love football.  How about you?,Yes, I enjoy watching a good with friends and beers!  Who's your team?
378,Don't hate me, but my favorite team is the New England Patriots!,No hate at all - it's pretty impressive what they've done and look to continue to dominate.  By proxy, I follow the Cardinals, but don't really consider them my team - I just like good games, teams, players
379,That's cool.  I find most people feel towards the Patriots like they feel towards Trump.  It's usually strong feelings of hate or love, not much in between.  But, Tom Brady is the GOAT!,TB & Bilichek are definitely GOATs!  Interesting comparison to Trump - it's hard not to have an opinion!
380,How true.  Speaking of Tom, did you know his high school JV football coach never attempted to play him, even though the team never won a game or even scored a touchdown?,That reminds me of the story where Michael Jordan had a hard time making his HS Varsity team - some coaches cannot see greatness if it's staring them in the face!
381,That's a fact.  I bet they feel foolish, now?,It's amazing how far the NFL and professional sports in general have come in terms of popularity and revenue.  I've heard that pro bowlers used to make more money than football players!
382,That's funny, but I hear the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are more than the lifetime earnings of an average NFL player.,I think the average career in the NFL is 3 season, for the average player with a league minimum salary, so a life time career as an engineer should make more money!
383,Somebody's done their homework and it shows! Anyway, do you realize the NFL only has one left handed  quarterback?,Interesting - who is the lefty QB.  Is that a system thing, are lefties discouraged from QB at an early age.  I don't see what the big deal is - baseball pitchers can be both.  Does it really matter that much in football?
384,Kellan Moore and to tell you the truth, I don't why there are not more of them?  I would think it's an advantage.,Right!  Anything to give a different look, roll the other way.  Once the ball is in the air, whats the difference.  I need answers from the NFL!
385,Me too!,Congrats on another Lombardi Trophy!  It was a strange playoff season, but great win for the Pats - great chatting with you today, really appreciate it!
386,Hello do you like football?,I do. Do you?
387,I like it,  I dont watch it too much though.,I watch all the time. My wife is not happy about my sports adiction though. My favorite team is the bears. Do you have a favorite team?
388,I like the 49ers.  did you know the NFL puts tracking chips on the players and football?,I put chips in my belly. Does that count?
389,lol absolutely!  I had no idea alex smith was so smart,  He took so many ap tests, he entered a university as a jounior.,Chicago hosted the first playoff game in 1932 on an 80 yard dirt field.
390,Thats cool.  That was a long time ago lol,Yeah. Did you know there's a $60M stadium in Texas? FOR HIGH SCHOOL?
391,Thats insane.  Football generates a lot of money in texas though lol not much to do.,I could not imagine being so rich I donated to the construction of a $60M HS football stadium. Im just trying to keep my lights on.
392,lol the struggle is real.  I cant believe that the average nfl game has only 11 min of game play.,I feel like there are too many commercials and replays and measurements.
393,Yeah,  too much fluff.  and whats with all the time outs and fouls and huddles.  Football can take so much time.,Maybe that's why i usually drink too much watching the games.
394,lol i think thats why we all drink too much, we are waiting to watch the game lol,At least I am not the only one! Although I am usually the only one watching football and drinking.
395,Did you know the average lifetime earning of an engineer is higher than football players and mlb players?  That is probably not including like sponsorship and extras though right?,Agreed. But I also think the lower end of the spectrum's avg career is like 2 years.
396,do you like football?,I love it. Do you know what color is the U of Iowa visitor locker room?
397,Yes it is actually all pink but I do not know why,Me either. Did you know bowlers made more than footballers in the 60s?
398,I guess it was a more popular sport back in the day,True. Do you know what is the highest score in college football?
399,Yes it was 222-0, do you know who played?,Yes it was Georgia Tech that beat Cumberland in 1916
400,Yeah. Did you know that ESPN won an Emmy once?,Yes they won it for the superimposed yellow line
401,Yeah it has made game watching so much easier at home,Very true. Did you know that women can play in the NFL too?
402,Yes there is no rule that says they cannot if they qualify,Yeah. The gameplay is only 11 minutes anyways
403,I know and yet we are glued to the tv for hours to an end,I know right? Do you know of that rule for Saints cheerleaders?
404,Yes they cannot eat in the same place as the players,Yes and they also have to leave mid meal if they walk in
405,yeah too bad it is still around. Do you like Brady?,I sure do. He was a back up QB when he was in high school
406,Yes and he was never started despite the fact that they were not doing well as a team,Their loss really I guess. Nice chat today
407,Hello!  Are you much of a football fan?  I don't watch it much TBH, but I do find a lot of facets of it to be pretty interesting..,Good afternoon!  Football is not my favorite sport, but I do enjoy a good game.
408,Get this, Iowa's locker room for visitors is painted PINK.  Trying to psyche out the other team, I bet.  LOL,That psychology might be a bit antiquated because I think a lot of guys don't feel the same about pink as they used to in the good old days
409,That could be true.  I'm told that they did an experiment where they put weight lighters in a pink colored gym and found they couldn't lift as much.  BUT, I heard about that in high school (some twenty plus years ago) so things may be different since then.,Interesting - I have heard about the subconscious affect that color has on mood (never paint a kitchen red) but I wasn't sure if that was just an urban myth?
410,I don't know, I think it varies and could be different from person to person.  Some people, for example find blue to be smoothing and calming, while others think it makes things feel cold.,Very true - and circling back to the pink locker room, I'm sure the initial intent was to emasculate the opponent and beat them before they take the field
411,You know, neatly enough, there's NO rules in the NFL against women being players.  So long as they meet the physical requirements, that is.,I've heard that, that they didn't think they needed the rule because in the old days the game was much different as were the social norms.  I know some females have played in college football recently
412,Hey, I say if they can do the physical stuff let them go at it if they want.  Although, admittedly if I had a daughter playing football I'd worry about her being tackled.... some of those guys are HUGE.,Totally agree - if they have the ability and the desire to play in the NFL, awesome.  But I sure as heck wouldn't want my daughters anywhere near that field!
413,Even if they were cheerleaders I'd be concerned.  Believe it or not, cheerleaders have more injuries than any other sport.,College cheerleaders for sure have a ton of injuries as they do way more of the flipping and gymnastics.  I've seen NFL Cheerleaders up close and they basically just stand there for 80% of the game....
414,Some teams have some pretty strict rules about cheerleaders, especially in terms of their interaction with the players.,I bet back in the day the distraction proved to be big enough of a problem that those non-fraternization rules were implemented.  Today, it's so much of a business that I doubt it would be much of an issue
415,Well, New Orleans Saints cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as one of the players.  If a player enters and they're already eating, they have to leave.  How nutty is that?,I bet if the Cheerleaders had a union like the players do, they could get that rule thrown out!
416,Maybe I dunno... Here's another weird tidbit... for as long as NFL games are, there's only about eleven minutes of live gameplay.  Can you believe it?,I did know that, because the NFL Network replays games during the week and they are able to trim them down to about a 30 min segment (with commercials) - it is amazing how little action there is in an "action packed" game!
417,Guess all the set ups, coaches talking, huddles, etc, etc, take up way more time than you'd think!,And the incessant TV timeouts!!!   After a bad game, I feel like I just wasted 3 hours of my life - and it was only really 11 min!?!?!
418,Yeah, it's crazy.  Did you know they have high tech chips put in the players shoulder pads?  Keeps track of where they are and whatnot.,I wish they would put those chips in the ball - so they could tell when it crosses the endzone or out of bounds!
419,Weell.. supposedly they have one in the ball that tracks it's speed, rotation and location.  I don't know why they don't use that instead of relying on the referees.  (Guess it's just tradition or something...),You're probably right - tradition over technology!  Hey, in case this ends abruptly - it's been great chatting with you!
420,Are you an NFL fan?  If you don't know, there is a 17 week regular season.,Hey! Well, I follow games, but I wouldn't say I'm really fan. How about you?
421,Did you know a female can play in the NFL because there is no official rule against it.,No, it's absolutely surprise for me
422,Also, in a whole NFL game, there is only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay.,Friend of mine told me that. Yes, it's fact
423,That is crazy. The New Orleans saints have a rule were there cheerleaders can't eat at the same restaurant as the players.,It looks like old tradition, which doesn't make any sense.
424,And if the cheerleaders are already there when the players come in, the cheerleaders have to leave.,Don't you think this rule is terrible? What if they were eating?
425,That sounds sexist to me. Some more football facts you may not know is that The University of Iowa has a completely Pink visitors locker room.,It's very funny. They want to shock enemies. Anyway it's funny
426,Something I could not believe was that the top bowlers made twice as much as top football players in 1960.,Me too actually. Did you know that the highest score ever in a football game was 222-0 in 1916?
427,No, that is a lot of points.  I did know that RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis, who played for the Patriots never had a fumble.,Me too. It's even difficult to guess. Also I'm surprised that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than average lifetime earnings of an NFL player. I was sure they make a lot.
428,I just can't believe that.  Did you know Tom Brady was a backup Quarterback in high school.,I guess my dad knows it. He knows about Tom Brady quite a lot.
429,He was either bad or the coach was an idiot.  But even though his team was having a historically bad season, he never got a chance to start.,I agreed. He didn't show his best. Anyway it is sport. You never know...
430,I also know that there is only one left handed Quarterback in the NFL.  It is Kellan Moore.,Yes, I know. I don't know a lot of such facts, but somehow I've heard about it.
431,Well, have a great day.,Thanks, my friend! Have a good one!
432,I didn't find this article very interesting. How about you?,Yeah I'm not very interested in football so it took me a while to get through. I did think it was a little crazy that the NFL uses tracking chips on their players and equipment though
433,yeah some of the facts caught me of guard too. Like that fact that there is no written rule against female players.,Right? I would love to see a female in the NFL. I also couldn't believe that the American flags they use weight 1100- like I know they're big but its hard to imagine a flag weighing that much haha
434,I do not understand the rule about new orleans saint players and cheerleaders.,I don't remember reading about that just now in my article, but it sounds familiar. It has something to do with them not being able to hang out right? Like they can't go to the same parties or other places at the same time, yeah?
435,yeah even if a cheerleader is eating at a restaurant and an nfl player comes in to dine at the restaurant, any nfl player, they are required to leave. wow,Is it always the cheerleaders that have to leave? Like if she's already there and a player walks in, she has to be the one to go? Thats really strange
436,yeah that's what it says. No fraternization at all.,That's...really weird. Speaking of weird, I guess there is a high school stadium in Texas that cost $60 million to build and seats 18,000 people- who knew people cared that much about high school football?!
437,oh sure, in some parts of Texas there is nothing else to do for a hundred miles at least. For some small towns, high school football is all the excitement they get.,Yeah that makes sense. I guess if I had nothing else, I might have to turn to football for entertainment haha. Did you read about Matt Patricia? Apparently he was a rocket scientists before his NFL coaching job.
438,I think we have different facts. But that is interesting. One of mine is that the university of Iowa's visitor locker room for football is painted completely pink. Hilarious!,Hah that is actually pretty funny! I wonder if its effective in throwing off the opposing team a bit. I read that Kellan Moore is the only left handed quarterback in the NFL- not the most interesting fact, but kind of surprising. I didn't think being left-handed was that uncommon. I wonder how many left handed ones they've had overall?
439,That is interesting. I thought there would have been more as well. Just like in baseball.,Is being left-handed unusual in baseball too?  Or are you saying its not uncommon? Speaking of baseball, I guess Russell Wilson is still under an MLB contract? I didn't know that was possible!
440,Lol all these crazy fun facts. I was saying it is way more common in baseball, to see both left and right handed pitchers.,Right- that's what I thought! I feel like these are good for potential trivia questions haha Like I read that Snoop Dogg wrote a fight song for his son's high school team. I wonder what that sounds like haha
441,yeah and that the highest football score ever was in 1916 222- 0,222? Thats insane. I wonder how long that game lasted?
442,Much of a football fan?  Interested in Redskins or Buccaneers?,Only if they have a female player on their teams.
443,We may be out of luck on that one.  I lived in DC for a number of year, so some would thin I have an interest in DC winning.,I'm a New Orleans native, and won't support the Saints, until they get rid of that archaic rule regarding cheerleaders being in the same restaurants as the players.
444,Agreed, I really don't like the whole cheerleader thing.  I have a young daughter and would hate for her to want to be a cheerleader.,Mine doesn't cheer, as I don't like the culture. My son's girlfriend plays football for their school, she's their kicker. I'm surprised no NFL team has a woman kicker.
445,Well there is no rule against it.  I'm sure there would be a lot of fuss in the media for a few weeks, and then once she played it would be forgotten.  I know in UK soccer they have women referees, once they started doing it everyone got over it.,Do they also have tracking chips in their balls over there/
446,Probably, I know most big sports leagues track just about everything the players do, always looking for that edge.,Thats insane. I think it's invasive, and wouldn't want a tracker in my shoulder pads, if I were a player.
447,I think the compensation football players get now would allow me to get over it.  Although I think we assume most players are set for life after a career, it might not be true.,Maybe. I still can't believe ESPN won an Emmy for that superimposed yellow line. Must have been a bad year, if they won for that.
448,I suppose if you are really into the game it matters to you, remembering a number in your head can be difficult.  I remember my son wondering how the line moved on the pitch when he was really young.,It's interesting that Baker Mayfield thought about becoming a pro gamer. I wonder how that would have worked out for him.
449,I've been hearing more and more about pro gaming, apparently there is money in in now.  Colleges have started offering scholarships for e-sport league players.  Not sure how I feel about that, I guess it's safer than football.,He is a Halo 3 guru, I guess. If they are at that level, then they probably make more than what a scholarship is worth. I know some of the pros make millions.
450,I wonder how long a pro gamer career lasts?  If it's not longer than a football players they will run into the same issue where a regular career pays more than a short sports career.,I suppose as long as their reflexes hold out. It's funny, pro bowlers used to make more than pro football players.
451,I think a pro bowling career might last a little longer, doesn't seem much chance of injury. ESPN needs to come up with an innovation for bowling, its very repetitive.,The same could be said for footall.
452,Guess you have a point, I still don't understand how you can turn 11 minutes of play into three hours of TV.  It's been good chatting to you.,I don't understand that either, any more than I understand why there is only one left handed quarterback. It's been fun, have a good one.
453,Hello! How are you today?,Hello! I hope you like football! Because I am ready to talk about football!  Do you ilke football?
454,I am so ready to talk about football lol. I love it it! Do you like NFL or college more?,I love any type of football! association football (known as soccer in some countries), Australian rules, rugby football! But the good ol' National Football League (NFL) might be my favorite!
455,I can't believe there are so many different sports called football though. Who is your favorite NFL team?,With 32 teams, it's hard to pick! Who do you like?
456,I'm a Vikings fan but I like watching the Broncos since I live in Colorado Springs. Can you believe there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay?,Wow, just 11 minutes? Is that it? I know the NFL uses tracking chips embedded in shoulders to track players moves. That's a lot of work for just 11 minutes of live play!
457,It makes the data analysts job very easy I'm sure haha. ESPN even won an emmy for that yellow first down line!,They sure are an innovative league! Did you know there is even a rocket scientist coaching in the NFL?!
458,Isn't that Matt Patricia?,It is! He was an aeronautical engineer before coaching in the NFL! His school, RPI, even had the words "sin", "cosine", and "tangent" in their fight song!
459,Oh wow! I'm not smart enough to even go to those football games! It would be interesting to see that 222-0 football game in 1916 though!,Yeah! I do like the entertainment thought. You know, we talked about fight songs a minute ago; did you know that Snoop Dogg wrote a fight song for his son's high school football game!?
460,I bet that jumped to the billboard charts after being written huh? lol that is funny!,I thought so too! You know, even high school football is really popular. There is a high school football stadium in Allen, Texas with 18,000 seats!
461,Didn't it cost 60 million dollars? That is insane, I bet the teachers are still underpaid there too!,Yup! That's the one! So much money is spent on football! Did you know that those humongous American flags at football stadiums cost $50,000 to make!?
462,It is cool to see but that is a lot of money! I hope it goes to a good cause! Anyways, great chat have an awesome day!,Indeed! And those flags weigh 1,100 pounds! Go big or go home, as they say! Good bye!
463,Do you like to talk about football?,Hi, yes, sports in general !! and of course about football!
464,Nice!  The University of Iowa painted their visitors locker room pink! lol,hahaha that is pretty funny and not intimidating at all!
465,I know.  In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars!,Wow that shocked me... nothing like that today did you know three football coaches are the highest paid employees of the us defense department!
466,That's incredible!  The highest score ever in a football game is when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0!,wow what a score!! did you know there is a fight song from a school written by snoop dog!
467,I didn't.  That's neat!  ESPN won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow first down line on tv.,I think that is cool! Technology has allowed for a way more exciting game, like the tracking chips!
468,I agree!  Baker Mayfield once considered quitting football to pursue a full time competitive gaming career.,wow, I wouldn't want a change like that.. did you know there are many other types of football like soccer, rugby  gaelic football!!
469,Yes I've seen them.  I had a friend that was in Rugby club years and years ago.,Cool I love soccer, follow the FC barcelona... but do not know anything about Australian football!
470,That's funny.  That same friend was from England and was big on Manchester United.  The average NFL game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay.  Seems crazy to pay all that money for a ticket when looked at from that perspective.,Seems like it but the reality is that the whole show if worth it and with the tracking chip you get info like the ball speed, the velocity and that adds to the average 11 minute hahaha
471,lol   The average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an NFL player and an average MLB player.,Oh wow. But i think is way more fun to play football... but I think the engineer has to work many more years.. Have you seen the super super big flags at the football stadiums
472,I have seen them!  Those flags are huge!,They weight more that 1000 pounds and cost about $50,000 wow!
473,I don't know much about football, but apparently Adrian Peterson is a new star on the Redskins team.,He seems to have done well, Alex Smith struggled in that game.  He is typically on point, to what I know,
474,It's pretty amazing how he got a shot, seeing as he wasn't in the training camp.  It sounds like he has a lot of stamina.,He is ready and willing to do what ever Gruden will give him.  Definitely a hard worker.
475,I think NFL players make a lot of money these days, so I bet he's glad to be on a team again. However, I didn't know that bowlers in 1960 made more than football stars.,That is kinda crazy, I wonder how much that pay was, and what the gap is today.
476,It's probably not as much as it was in 1960 - twice as much, wow.  That makes me want to take up bowling!  I think the game Peterson played wasn't a very clear win, only a few scores.  There was one game in 1916 where the final score was 222-0.  I didn't know the game could go that high!,Neither did I .  That is a pretty large gap.  In most games there is only 11 minutes of live game play anyway, that game must have had a lot more.
477,Yeah.  I didn't realize it was only around 11 minutes of actual play.  Thinking about it, though, I guess they time all the huddles and positioning.  I didn't know the circular huddle was created by a deaf quarterback.  I thought that began with the game so they could all hear each other.,It is amazing that what they come up with, the huddle has become iconic.
478,Yes it has become iconic.  This Peterson is called a running back.  Is that the guy who tries to throw it to the quarterback or tries to catch the ball?,He is the guy that the quarterback hands the ball off to.
479,Oh ok.  I knew the quarterback was an important guy for offense, but Peterson's position sounded important too.  I think football players have a lot of pressure to do well.  Apparently the NFL uses chips to track lots of stats about them.  I wonder if that affects their pay.,Im not sure, but I know they do use the data from the chips to make play safer for them and make their pads better.
480,That's a good thing.  I think they can easily get injured without pads.  I think padding is more like the American kind of football.  I've seen some clips of rugby played without pads.  That looks pretty rough.,Yeah, Gaelic football is the same way, Im not sure how it works but it isnt for the weak.
481,I personally like the European type of football, also called soccer.  I like the strategy and skill.  I've been to an international soccer game before, it was really awesome to watch.,Me too.  I always played growing up.  I loved watching the world cup this past summer.
482,I haven't watched sports lately.  It's funny how things change, like how Tom Brady became a super bowl champ, but in high school they didn't even give him a chance.,I know, I bet they feel a little stupid now seeing what he has become.
483,Yes I think so.  I wonder if Peterson wants to win such an award before he has to retire.  Hopefully the Redskins will do better than the game against the Broncos, so he has a chance to prove himself.,I know he has become a more dominant force as he gains experience.  Anyway, nice chat!  Have a good night.
484,I was just reading about the NFL. Are you a football fan?,I love football, Go Detroit Lions!! What about you?
485,I am a Vikings fan, big time. I was reading about Nick Foles' up and down career. The Eagles sure killed my Vikes in the playoffs last year!,It will be interesting to see how Foles does from here on out, must be irritating for Eagles fans never knowing!
486,Yes. I was surprised that the Patriots lost the Super Bowl last year. Did you know that when TB was a QB in high school as a backup, they never played him on the JV team when they were having a really bad season. Funny!,That is funny, I don't care for patriots but can't help but like Brady, a Michigan man go blue!!
487,Exactly. You cannot fault his tremendous commitment to the game. I think a Bears/Patriots superbowl would be fun again.,I've read that Snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his son's football team in high  school, that could be interesting!
488,Yes. That is probably a pretty vivid and inspiring song!,I was also interested to read about the Lions' coach is a rocket scientist! Have you seen him during a game? So rough looking
489,Matt Patricia? He is super smart! So is Alex Smith, one of my favorite QB's. He got a bachelor's degree in 2 years and a master's soon after.,That is good to hear, some of those NFL players don't seem too intelligent, and can be so cocky and
490,I agree. Here's a piece of football trivia. The huddle was created because of a deaf QB, so that the other team could not read his hand signals. Interesting...,Oh how cool is that! Also interesting is that they embed chips in the should pads to track the players every move
491,I had heard that somewhere. Plus all of the wonderful new technology in the helmets to help with the concussion problem.,Yes that is a scary thing!
492,Seems to be getting worse, despite the tech advances. Players must be stronger, bigger and faster?,Definitely, so many people can be so competitive it gets scary.
493,Yes. Hey do you know the highest score ever in a football game?  You'll never guess!,I have no idea, but would guess maybe 77?
494,Good try!  In 1916, it was 222-0. Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland.  Wow!,Holy cow that is a huge score, and Cumberland didn't even make it on the board!
495,Are you a football fan?  Do you have a favorite team?,I like the Steelers. How bout you.
496,I'm a Steelers fan too!  I live right on the Ohio/PA line.  Did you know that there is only 1 left handed QB in the NFL - Kellan Moore.,I did know that. You would think there would be more.
497,I know.  What do you think of the NFL using tracking chips in the players shoulders and in the footballs?,I think its an amazing technology. The things they can do these days.
498,I know.  I just wonder though what exactly those chips do.  Like ...could they read where other chips are on the field?  ..and if so...could a chip in the shoulder pads of a wide receiver be programmed to the chip that's in the football making the football come to the receiver's chip location?,That's interesting to think about. I bet belichek has already checked into that.
499,hahaha  An average NFL game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay.  Crazy when they make it stretch out to over 3 hours.,I know right. They get all that money for 11 minutes worth of entertainment.
500,it pays to be an engineer as their lifetime earnings are higher than that of the lifetime earnings of an average NFL or MLB player.,Yeah but I think it would be a lot more fun to play football for a living.
501,I'm with you there!  lol  In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars.,I think the players union has rectified that situation.
502,Yes! lol  I wonder why the University of Iowa painted their visitors locker room pink?  Probably to mess with the team. lol,To mess with the visiting team. Do you think it worked.
503,I don't think so. lol  How about the highest scoring game ever when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland in 1916 by a score of 222-0!,They were just rubbing it in that last 200 points huh.
504,lol Poor Cumberland.  Did you know that the circular huddle was created by a deaf QB so the other team couldn't steal his hand signals?,Yeah and the huddle has become so engrained into football. Its hard to think of the game without it.
505,Hi.  Do you like the NFL and the Ravens?,I like the nfl. Not so much the ravens.
506,Same here.  I guess Lamar Jackson is back (or has been back)... SO many injuries in the NFL.,Im a steelers fan and we play them twice a year. I promise you Im not worried about lamar Jackson.
507,Ha.  I see... I'm a Chiefs fan and I'm not losing any sleep. I think the Ravens would do better if they could the players out of jail.  I didn't know the Saints had an 8-1 record.,Jackson can run but he cant throw at all. You all got a pretty good QB up there in KC tho
508,Yeah, Mahomes is a great surprise.  If he stays healthy, he'll give Brady a run for his money, career stats-wise.,Brady will be out in the next few years. I would say staying healthy and not falling off like a lot of guys do after one good year is his main concerns.
509,Yes, I agree... Maybe he'll be like Luck and avoid those sacks.  Hope so, I'd hate to see him go and he's so young.,To be honest the chiefs scare me more than the patriots do at this point.
510,Yeah, I was surprise to see that Rams come out on top.  I think the Pats are going downhill.,I sure hope so. Im sick of them. Lol. Did you know that there is a rocket scientist coaching in the nfl.
511,I did not.  Is he doing well?  I can't believe that or that there is only 11 average minutes of gameplay in an NFL game.,His name is mat patrecia. Im not sure who he coaches.
512,I'm not sure those are transferable talents... Nor do I think painting a visitors locker room pink is going to do anything at the U. of Iowa.,Yeah I dont see that doing much. It would make a good team laugh and who cares what it does to a bad team. Lol.
513,I played in HS and on away games we used the girls locker rooms.  It had no effect although I did break a Barry Manilow album after a loss.  I regret that... We did have a circular huddle thank to a deaf QB of yesteryear.,That huddle has grown into a major part of the game.
514,Yeah... I don't remember Alex Smith being so smart or being a 1st round draft pick...,I think he was drafted by the patriots wasnt he. I didnt think he was a first rounder either.
515,This article I read says he was a first rounder in 2005 - doesn't say to whom.  Thanks for the chat and good luck to the Steelers.,Have a good one.
516,Do you watch football?,Yes.  I watch it all season long and even have been watching the Alliance league.
517,I watch it too. Did you know Kellan Moore is the only lefty?,I didn't know that.  Come to think of it I can't recall any lefties.  Former Patriots running back Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled the ball once during his career.  Impressive.
518,Interesting, was he the best running back then?,I would say that would go to Jim Brown.  Espn won an emmy award of creating the superimposed first down line.  Nice.
519,That is probably worth it. That line is super cool.,I agree.  In the 1960s top bowlers made two times as much as the top football stars of that era.
520,WOW! That is pretty cool, gives me hope then!,LOL  Do you know what the highest score ever was for a football game at the college level?
521,No, what was it?,222-0!  Georgia tech beat Cumberland in 1916.
522,WOW! That is a lot. Did you know that university of Iowa paints their guest locker room pink?,lol That's funny!  They must do that to get in the heads of who they are playing.
523,I think so, but honestly you have to wonder if it just makes the other team angry.,I don't think they probably really care. Do you know who Alex Smith is?
524,Not really, is he a football player?,Yes.  He's a QB.  He was the first pick in the 2005 draft by the 49er's.  What's impressive about him is that he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 2 years!
525,Interesting. Is he left handed too?,No.  He's a righty.  I'm surprised that there's only 11 minutes of live gameplay per an average NFL game.
526,Hello, do you know much about quarterbacks?,I do!  I know that Kellan Moore is the only left handed QB in the NFL.
527,That's interesting. What about Vick?,He's retired.  But, he's coaching one of the teams in the new American Alliance of Football league.  Do you have a favorite QB?  Mine is Baker Mayfield.
528,I did not know that. I would say Mahomes is my favorite right now. I also like Andy Dalton.,Mahomes is good and I like Dalton.  Be curious to see what Mahomes does next year.  See if teams can adjust to him.  Baker Mayfield once considered quitting football to pursue a full time competitive gaming career.  Yikes!  That sounds too risky.
529,I agree. Did you know Alex Smith took so many AP classes in high school that he was a junior when he entered college?,I didn't know that.  That's pretty impressive!  The circular huddle was created by a deaf QB named Paul Hubbard so the other team could not read his hand signals.
530,That's pretty interesting. I had no idea. Do you like the NFL in general?,I do.  I've been an NFL fan my whole life.  Probably more so though before big money changed the game.
531,Me too. Did you know the NFL has no written rule against females playing in the league?,I did know that.  I wonder if we'll see one soon.  Maybe a kicker?
532,I bet it will be a kicker too.,Did you know that there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay per game?
533,I did not know that, but that is pretty amazing. I would have never guessed that.,Short time considering they stretch out a game to 3 hours. lol  What do you think of the tracking chips they put in the players shoulder pads and footballs to track data?
534,I agree. Yes, I heard they do that to track rotation, ball speed, location, and velocity.,I've wondered if they could be attracted to other chips?  Like would the chips in the balls be programmed to be attracted to the chips in the wide receivers shoulder pads?
535,I'm not too sure how that works, but curious to know.,The highest scoring football game ever was 222-0 when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland in 1916.  What a blowout!
536,Hi, do you like the NFL?,It's pretty entertaining. Can you believe the very first playoff game was in 1932?
537,That was a long time ago! Like when georgia tech beat cumberland!,Yeah, on an 80-yard long dirt field that was the home of an NHL team!
538,Wait, what? What was the field? The cumberland game? Tell me more!,The field of the first playoff game in 1932 was actually on a dirt field inside the Chicago stadium which was where the Blackhawks played their games at the time.
539,That's crazy! Im in chicago and I did not know that! I did love the old stadium though!,Nice. Did you know there was a football coach in the NFL who is also literally a rocket scientist?
540,I did! But I am also a huge football junkie. Matt Patricia! He is the lions head coach.,That's cool. The Lions have a pretty good quarterback.
541,I agree. Although he is long in the tooth. As a bears fan, I hope they do poorly!,I can't believe there is only one left-handed quarterback in the league.
542,Is it Byran Leftwich?,No, it's Kellan Moore.
543,Wow, I thought it was byron leftwich. He was good too!  Do you have a favorite NFL team?,I don't, I'm more of a baseball fan. Though Russell Wilson plays both!
544,I love baseball too. I am a cubs fam though. Big fan. Watching MLB network now!,Cool. Yeah, Wilson is technically still under an MLB contract even though he hasn't played since 2011.
545,He has been to a few spring trainings though. Rnagers an Yankees.,Yeah, the Rangers traded him to the Yankees last year.
546,Nice chatting with you!,You, too! Have a good one!
547,Hello, did you happen to watch the Superbowl yesterday?,Yes I did. Did you?
548,I did, I thought it was a good game, both teams had strong defenses I think Tom Brady did a good job even though he finished as the third most valuable qb,Both defenses did play good. Who were the two QBs more valuable than Tom Brady?
549,Im not sure but if had to gues I would say Aaron Roders and Drew Brees.,I see. Are you talking about the super bowl or the entire season?
550,Im talking about the entire season, I think he might go up to second or first with his performance last night, he threw a great pass for the only touchdown,But there were not passing touch downs last night.
551,I know, but the pass that was almost a touchdown, thats the one im refering to.,I see. Yes that was a very good pass. Not many QBs could make that throw.
552,Yeah, too bad it wasnt a touchdown though, so close just a few more yards, so what is your favorite NFL team?,The Dallas Cowboys. I've been watching them since I was a little kid. How about you?
553,My favorite team is the Patriots so I had a pretty good time last night, how did the Cowboys do this season?,That's awesome. It's always nice when your favorite team wins the championship. The Cowboys won their division but lost in the 2nd round of the playoffs this year.
554,Thats too bad, maybe next year they will make it, you know the saints have this unfair rule and if a cheerleader is at a restaurant and a player goes to the same place she must then leave,Really? That's a pretty crazy rule that I  have never hard of. Did you also know that Brad Johnson is the only QB to ever throw  touchdown pass to himself?
555,How is that possible lol, I might have to look for that strange fact in YouTube later, I wonder how the pass went,It was near the goal line and when he threw the ball it was deflected by a lineman but went right back to him. He caught it and ran it in. Was pretty crazy.
556,It must have been great and really usual since he is the only one to have done that, I dont know were the fact of the 11 minutes of gameplay comes from, it sure seems like a game is a lot longer and the clock is always paused.,Yeah it would seem like a lot longer than 11 minutes to me as well.
557,Do you follow football much?,Hello there I do watch it, how about you?
558,I love watching it. Do you watch both college and NFL? Who are your teams?,I follow the Packers, how about you?
559,Me too, I love Aaron Rodgers. I am an Iowa Hawkeye fan, did you hear that they paint their locker room for the other team pink,I heard about that, that is too funny, and I guess it's proven to help the other team relax.
560,right, I think it has worked, they have beat quality teams at home. Did you know there is no rule against females playing in the league,I think I heard that, I think it would be very cool to see a female player make a roster and play.
561,Right, I heard there may be a female kicker going to play college football somewhere, that would be neat,Yeah it sure would be, even if it was just kicker to start.
562,for sure, that would open up a lot of opportunities. Did you hear about the Saints cheerleader rule?,I think so, the one where they would have to leave a place if members of the team show?
563,yea that is pretty sexist in my opinion. That makes the female potential in the nfl take a step back, my opinion,Yeah I would have to agree with you there, seems dumb to me to be honest.
564,for sure i agree, do you watch college,Yeah I watch some college but not very closely, always seems like the same schools, how about you?
565,same, just the Hawkeyes mostly. Did you hear about the game in 1916 that ended 222-0,I heard about that wow!  I wonder how many of the fans of the opposing team were still in the stands at the end?
566,I wonder if they still had a football program after that lol! I would have quit once the score got to be like 100-0,Yeah they just cancel the whole program lol, and how did they even score that many? You can't even score that much in Tecmo Super Bowl.
567,Hi, I read somewhere that the average NFL game has only 11 minutes of actual game play, that's hard to believe isn't it?,yes,Anyone who has ever tuned into an NFL broadcast knows that plenty of air time is spent showing players huddling, coaches yelling, and fans cheering
568,Yeah, it seems like alot of wasted time.,I do not like that
569,Ok, when do you think the NFL will get its first female player?,I do not know that. It would be nice if it happened.
570,I don't understand, but I would think they are people sitting around and betting on the date the first woman player will be admitted to the NFL.,sorry i do not know that details.
571,ok, that's fine.  Do you know that the University of Iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is painted pink?,yes i think,College Football ... Visiting locker rooms are often cramped places that aren't meant to be . for a home team's opponents, but the Hawkeyes take things up a notch
572,I'd say so too.  Do you know NFL payers have tracking chips embedded in their shoulder pads to record their every move on the field?,yes i know little bit, Sep 7, 2017 - Last season, Zebra Technologies brought next-gen stats to the NFL by implementing their RFID chips in NFL players' pads to track speed,
573,That's cool, I wonder who's the fastest player?,I think,Ten running backs were faster, and wide receiver John Ross set the combine record at 4.22. But it's Fournette, the 240-pound bruiser
574,Does Fournette play for the Jacksonville Jaguars?,Sorry i don't know that details please explain.
575,I was just wondering what NFL team he played for.  What is your favorite football team?,I like, The Green Bay Packers are a professional American football team based in Green Bay, Wisconsin.
576,Oh cool, the Packers are good.  I like the Dallas Cowboys, America's team.,okay, that nice. which player you mostly like?
577,Hello, do you know much about the quarterback position?,I do! I know that the NFL only has one left handed quarterback now, do you?
578,That's interesting. I did not know that. I know Vick was a lefty.,and the great Steve Young haha. Can you believe bowlers once earned more money than football players?
579,I find that hard to believe. Bowling has really gone downhill since then.,It really has, or has football gone up?
580,Maybe just football has gone up. Baker Mayfield once thought about quitting football to pursue a career in professional gaming.,I wonder if he is still great at Halo 3? I'm surprised Alex Smith is still playing, given he's basically a genius!
581,I have no idea if he is. That's pretty amazing about Alex Smith. He must be very smart.,Oh for sure. I love watching football games, but hate that there is only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay.
582,That's very surprising. Did you know the NFL has no written rule against women playing?,I didn't know that, I wonder if any have tried out for teams! I hate that the New Orleans Saints kick cheerleaders out of restaurants if a player comes in though!
583,I think many teams have rules about players interacting with cheerleaders.,Maybe it is needed for the players? Could you imagine being at that college game where the score was 222-0?
584,I can't imagine losing by that much. I would be very sad.,I think the whole team would just quit after that haha. that was in 1916 though so it might have gotten better!
585,Iowa painted their opposing team locker room pink.,I thought that was always interesting, I wonder if it actually did affect other teams?
586,Not too sure. I don't see how that would really work all that well.,Maybe they should get an emmy like ESPN did for their yellow line during gameplay?
587,Do you know what AFC stands for?,I have no Idea is it American Football Champions?
588,I think so.  It makes sense.,Haahahaaaa, ok thats awesome i hope so too, why is it called football anyways? They play it with their hands. I dont get it some times.
589,Yes, football should be for soccer games since soccer players play using their feet.,you got that right lol, i feel the same way too, I love soccer, and i love watching the Players brawl in American football though, so talented I just Hope no one dies in the field one day they are talented and strong though, did you know that Kellan moore is the only left handed QB in the NFL? I GUESS RIGHT HANDED PEOPLE ARE JUST MORE FIT TO BE qbS.
590,I did not know that.  Are you watching football games this season?,Not in perticular I am forced to follow them though because of my job, I love talking about sports with my clients
591,People talk about sports during business conversations but we need to avoid talking about politics.  How do teams choose quaterbacks?  Is it like choosing leaders in a company?,Exactly I agree with you, with sports everything is into play though including race, I dont know how they choose the QB, But I know a fact that Only 2 Black QBs have won the Super bowl
592,Thanks for the info.  By the way, since we talked about it earlier, AFC stands for american football  conference (I just did some research while talking to you),Ohhh lol we were not so off then Its Close to American Football Confrence, they have come from far though, for example I read somewhere that The first nfl play off game was played on a dirt field in Chicago, but now look how fancy the fields are too much money lol, do you think players are overpaid?
593,I just found out that  NFL consists of NFC and AFC,ohhh wow, now I know what NFL and AFC are so what is NFC then?
594,NFC stands for National Football Conference.,Wow too complicate, I know though that NFL is one of the 4 majoy pro sports leagues in North America. I think thats pretty boss, and one thing I like is that They play football here in america and it makes enough money to get the Robert Krafts rich literally The Nfl Does not have to sell the sport anywhere else if it does not want to.
595,NFL owners make so much money - I do not mind if the players are overpaid because they are doing dangerous jobs. Do you know that there is no rule against female players?,I hear you My friend they have so much money if they can pay the Athlets that much, lol how much do you think they keep?? wait what do you mean no rule against female players? you mean they can play on a male team?
596,As long as they meet eligibility requirements.,ohhh wow! those guys are giants literally, but surprisingly young too, Tom Brady is getting too old for them I think thats why Patriots are not doing very good this year, do you believe women should play on an NFL team?
597,Are you a fan of the NFL?,Yes, I am a big Packers fan!
598,Nice! I like the Packers also, I like Aaron Rodgers. Do you like the saints at all?,No way, hate them. What about Demarcus Lawrence not getting the praise like he should? He is a great pass rusher!
599,I heard that, I think he will get that big contract though. Did you know the saints cheerleaders need to leave a restaurant if the players come, kind of sexist I think!,Yeah, that would suck to be them. The cheerleaders already don't get paid. I would be so embarrassed.
600,for sure, you know who does get paid well, engineers. They make more than nfl players over their lifetime,What! Thats crazy and those quarterback better stay in school and not rely on their bodies. Alex Smith is very smart, ya know?
601,I heard that and a great player. Didn't he get his degree super early?,Yeah and did it right. He can play and get degrees! Did you know the huddle was created by a deaf man?
602,I think I heard that! Wasnt it paul hubbard, he was so good for the browns!,Exactly, he didn't want anyone to see his hand signals. That is so cool.
603,For sure! are you a college football fan at all?,Yes, and Mayfield is my guy! He is from OU and we would go watch him play all the time. Ya know he wasn't gonna go for football once in his life?
604,Nice. I heard he was a gamer for halo 3. I could have beat him. I am an Iowa fan, they paint the locker rooms of the visitors pink!,HA, nice! I like confidence! Yeah Mayfield was gonna go become a gaming pro because nobody could beat him, according to him. Yes a pink room would be embarrassing and deflating for the other team..
605,Who plays halo 3 anymore lol. I was playing that like 15 years ago. I think the pink calms the other team too much,Oh, that is an interesting outlook. I think I agree.lol Ya know the highest scoring game occured in 1916 when Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland 222-0. Can you believe that?
606,Man I would have quit when the game got to 100-0. So embarrassing. Good chatting with you!,Thank you for the new perspective! Im gonna run with it
607,Hello. How are you.,Im great, are you a football fan?
608,Yeah. What do you think about vontaz burfict.,I think that was a low shot, hitting Antonio Brown like that, what are your thoughts?
609,I thought it was really low. He does it all the time too only good part was that it cost his team the game. .,It did, I bet his teamates were upset because of this, it was late in the game so yeah, serious consequences
610,Yeah. I dont like that dude.,Thats not  sport friendly, there was no flag on the play I dont think a suspension is a likely thinng the Steelers won 28-21
611,So what do you think will there ever be a womean in the nfl,I dont think so, theres no rule against that but I think its unlikely, what do you think?
612,Maybe a kicker, but I doubt it.,Yeah I think it's unlikely.
613,Just think the first time a woman got seriously hurt. It would not go over to well in the media.,What do you think about the 11 minutes of live gameplay?
614,I think the game shouldnt last 3 hours with only 11 minutes of gameplay.,I have the same thoughts, seems like an insult for fans and for viewers, too many adds, too many interruptions
615,Yeah. I can understand the super bowl taking longer but not regular season games.,I agree, it does take a long time, the NFL uses tracking chips
616,I know they have them in the players shoulder pads as well as in the footballs.,Yeah the chips in the footballs allows us to tell track, velocity, rotation, ball speed
617,Its such a good invention. We get a bunch of new stats from it.,I agree a lot of interesting stats, tech is taking over sports,
618,Hello.  Have you ever heard of Baker Mayfield?,Yes I have! Did you know he actually came close to quitting football in order to pursue a competitive gaming career? Glad he didn't as I would guess football is much more lucrative!
619,I did hear that and I'm glad he didn't too!  It surprises me though in a way to picture him being so good at video games. In another way I'm not because he is very competitive.,That is true. But you know what really surprises me? I can't believe there's only one left handed QB in the NFL and that's Kellan Moore. I figured there'd be far more left handers!
620,I've never actually noticed but it just seems like there should be.  Maybe there will be more quarterbacks like Patrick Mahomes.  I think he can throw with either hand.,Maybe so! I wonder if the deaf guy named Paul. D. Hubbard who created the circular huddles used today to keep opposing teams from reading his hand signals was left handed?
621,I don't know.  I think it's neat that there used to be a deaf quarterback and I wonder why there's none in current times.  The huddle is a smart way to protect his conversations though!,Indeed it is. Since we're on the subject of quarterbacks, do you like Tom Brady? I bet his old JV high team still kicks themselves to this day for refusing to start him when he was a backup despite never winning a game or scoring a touchdown that season. It's kind of sad, really.
622,Oh wow! i bet they do too!  That coach may not even coach anymore after realizing what a mistake he made.  I wonder why he just wouldn't give the backup a chance when clearly the starter was not doing so good.,It's a mystery, isn't it. But coaches sometimes make back decisions. I tell you what I often wonder is why we haven't had a female player drafted yet. Females are allowed to play as long as they meet the eligibility requirements, believe it or not!
623,I guess they haven't tried or been able to meet requirements.  I've seen a few female players, mostly kickers, on the news and other shows.  I know there is a female ref and I think an assistant coach of some kind now.,Is there really? I mean, since the average game is only 11 minutes in terms of live gameplay, you'd think we would have at least seen a female kicker by now, right?
624,The nfl is slow moving on some things.  Just look at the New Orleans Saints. They have a rule for the cheerleaders that if they are at a restaurant and a player comes in they have to leave.,That is hard to believe and I can't believe lawsuits haven't been filed yet unless it's just some silly voodoo superstition or something? Either way, in terms of money, women would be better off becoming engineers since they make more than the average lifetime earnings of both MLB and NFL players anyway.
625,Wow, that really surprises me. I mean, some of these contracts players get are so extreme!,Hey, even crazier, back in the 1960s, the top bowlers made more than the top football players. That is so depressing considering how rough football is compared to how easy bowling is.
626,I guess people weren't that into football back then like they are now.  Now ESPN wins an emmy for creating a yellow line to show where the first down is during the game.,That is true and that yellow line is so innovative. I couldn't watch a game without it today! But thankfully people are more into football today as I couldn't see a bowler making more than Benjarvus Green-Ellis who's never fumbled the football in his entire pro career. That would be plain wrong!
627,That would be wrong and I like that line too. It makes the game more intense and exciting when you know just how far a team has to go.  Do you watch any college football games?,I do like to watch college football. But I feel sorry for those teams who play Iowa at their stadium and have to sit in a pink lockerroom. I'm not sure if that's good or bad for the University of Iowa. Ha! What about you?
628,Hi, how are you?,Im great. how are you? are you a football person?
629,I'm good, thanks for asking.  Yes, I like football.,I don't watch too often. I usually follow the NFL right around playoffs. did you watch the super bowl this year?
630,Yes, I watched my favorite team, the Patriots pull out another win with my man, Tom Brady.,The patriots seem to always win. werent they called the Lannisters of the NFL?
631,Yes, they've been called that.  Hey don't hate, appreciate! LOL,LOL. Ok. i guess i usually root for the underdog. didnt the pats win last year too?
632,They've won a few times the past couple of years.,Um, doesnt brady have like a dozen rings or something? half a dozen?
633,Yeah, but he deserves every one of them, he has a very good work ethic.,yes, he also seems to have a unique diet. strawberry-less.
634,Don't forget the avocado icecream, he loves so much!,Why avocados? are they a vegan thing? he is a vegan right? is his wife?
635,I'm not sure about that icecream, it's supposed to be creamy with all the good fats, but it sounds just plain gross.  I ain't eating it!,i guess he sees the results and doesnt mind the taste. maybe you add salt or something? salsa? i wonder.
636,Uggh! you're making it worse!,LOL. sorry. i got carried away. I guess i should control myself during the chats or i might disgust my partner. Sorry.
637,Lol, he can eat whatever he wants as long as I can eat my chicken wings and drink my beer while watching him play.  I sat for over 3 hours watching that last Superbowl and about ran out of beer before the end.,You flirted with tragedy there my friend. you need to be better prepared! does amazon do same-day delivery of beer on sundays? Plan for success!
638,I was a little mad, especially when I keep hearing that there are only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay in a game. WTF?,Yeah, a lot of standing around and waiting waiting waiting. Anyway, great chat!
639,do you like the NFL?,Yes I do. DO you know that Kellan Moore is the only left handed QB?
640,WOw cool. Do you like Brady of the Patriots?,Yes I do, he is a good player, is he your favorite?
641,One of them yes. In high school he was a back up QB and never got started,Wow their loss I guess. Brad Johnson once threw himself a touchdown shot
642,Wait what? How is that even possible?,Exactly, that is why he is the only guy in history to have done that
643,Yeah I guess so. ALex Smith finished college in two years only,Nice, he must be smart. Did you know Russell WIlson is still under contract though he is not playing regularly?
644,Wow that is interesting. Yes Alex was smart but he also took lots of ap tests in high school and managed to move fast,Great planner too. Snoop dog once wrote a song for his son's team
645,Nice. U of Iowa painted the visitor locker room pink,I wonder if that is supposed to have some effect on the players
646,I wonder too. In the 60s bowlers made more than the football players,I guess football was not that popular back in the day as bowling was
647,True. DO you know the highest score in college football is 222-0?,Wow what, when was that and who was playing?
648,Yes it was Georgia Tech who beat Cumberland in 1916,WOw what a defeat . Nice chat
649,Hello - did you know the university of Iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is painted pink?,Hi! Is it the opposing players locker room that's painted pink or the players locker room? Why would they paint it pink?
650,It's the opposing players locker room. It's probably a psychological thing.,Wonder if there's any actual effect or they just want to get in their minds. I have never followed Canadian football, I would imagine hockey is considered America's favorite sport instead of football. Don't think hockey is quite as big as it is in Canada?
651,I think hockey is definitely bigger in Canada. I think football and baseball are bigger in America than hockey.,Even basketball too especially for March Madness! Maybe Canada have women playing in their football leagues because there's no official written rule preventing female players from playing, but no one has yet met the physical requirements to my knowledge.
652,Did you know the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars?,Does that still hold true, I'd imagine not since it seems as if football stars make a lot more than that and they make much more from endorsements too, if a bowler endorsed something, I don't think I would know them.
653,I bet it doesn't still hold true.,Unless the league factors in that they only average about 11 minutes of live gameplay so maybe it still does
654,That's crazy it's only 11 minutes of play.,Yes and yet I devote an entire afternoon to watching the games! The circular huddle that's used in games today was actually created by a deaf quarterback so the opposing team couldn't read his hand signals, he should've trademarked that!
655,That's a cool stat. I saw that Green-Ellis has never fumbled the ball in his NFL football career.,That's not an easy feat consider people are literally chasing you when you possess the ball, wonder if he can negotiate a better salary with that stat.
656,I can't believe he never fumbled. Never heard that stat before.,Kellan Moore is the only left-handed quarterback, would the opposing team need to adjust their plays to accommodate that dexterity bias?
657,I'm not sure what the opposing team would need to do to adjust.,If only the superbowl was as entertaining as the 1916 Georgia tech game when they defeated Cumberland by 222-0, actually I think that'd be a pretty boring game as well.
658,That would be pretty crazy. This past super bowl was pretty boring. Probably the most boring one ever.,Yeah, it really was but I still watched the whole thing. To my knowledge, I don't think the Rams or Patriots cheerleaders are treated like the Saints cheerleaders where they are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as the players.
659,Hi, how are you?,hey I'm good, do you have a favorite quarterback?
660,I like Jay Cutler. Do you?,ya he's good, I also like tom brady, Kellan Moore is interesting because he is left handed and the only quarterback like that
661,Yeah. I thought there would have been more leftys but I guess he is the only one. Do you know who alex smith is?,no I don't, I think hes a quarterback but thats all I know
662,He took so many AP tests in high school, he entered college as a junior! I barely passed high school. What a show off!,wow he sounds really smart! what is weird is that only 2 black quarterbacks have ever won the superbowl, I wonder why
663,Racism... The huddle was created by a deaf QB. Who knew!,ah interesting! and ya apparenlty a quarterback threw a touchdown pass to himself, how is that possible?
664,Was it Baker Mayfield. He's good at Halo 3! He claims he can beat anyone at OU in the game.,wow thats impressive, also impressive that over half of the biggest world stadiums are all american football stadiums
665,There's only one stadium that has a visiting locker room that is pink though, the university of iowa!,ya I bet! Only 1 team has a snoop dogg song for their anthem, and that is snoop doggs son's team haha
666,ESPN won an emmy for that yellow line of the field for first downs. Seems like a low bar for an emmy.,ya it seems obvious but maybe it was a big tech breakthrew at the time, have you seen those huge american flags at football stadiums?
667,I have. The ones for the national anthem that is unfurralled?,yup those, they cost 50k and are over 1000 pounds, thats nuts!
668,I can understnad the cost but 1000 pounds seems really heavy! For only 11 minutes of play too!,yup it does seem like a waste, did you hear about the tracking chips the nfl uses?
669,Do you like the Cleveland Browns team?,Not really.  I do kind of feel sorry for them.  Even with Joe Thomas, I wonder if they could turn things around.
670,I don't really follow football at all to be honest. Only my hometown football team-the Buffalo Bills,I'm a Chiefs fan myself.  They do say the Thomas will soon be in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  Cold there?  It is here at 15 degrees and snow.
671,I think that's great that he will be in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Yep it's cold here. It's in the 20s, but not much snow,Well, I have some snow you can have.  I've been to Canton, OH but regret not going to the Hall of Fame.
672,I've never really gone anywhere. It doesn't snow as much in Buffalo as people think. Only in certain areas. Tyrod Taylor used to be our quarterback.,I remember him.  A super Browns fan gave me a Browns cap on a flight I shared with her.  I guess she was a member of the Dog Pound.
673,That's so great! I hear the Browns have really great fans. Buffalo does too. We don't have a great team, but we love them.,Back in the day the Bills did well.  Was it the late 1980's?  Did you know that the NFL has no rules that women can't play?
674,Yep, I think it was the late 80s that we did well. We went to 4 super bowls but couldn't win any of them. The first one was the closest. It still breaks our hearts. The missed field goal-Wide Right are 2 words we all hate,Who was the QB?  I can picture him but can't think of the name... Did ya know that Kellan Moore is the only left-handed QB in the NFL?
675,That is interesting about Keilan Moore. What team does he play for? Our QB's name was Jim Kelly. We love him. He's battled cancer and won. We really admire him,I'm not sure.  I'm more of a football fan - my alma maters.   I played in HS and we used circular huddles.  I didn't know that originated for a deaf QB.
676,That's great that you played in HS. What position did you play? I didn't know circular huddles originated for a deaf QB! That's fascinating!,I started as a defensive back, safety and special teams.  Ah, the glory days. Funny, we didn't have any pink locker rooms for the visiting team but they did have to use the girls locker room.
677,Are you a female? You had mentioned girls can play in the NFL. I'm a female, but never played sports. I'm not very good at any sports,Having played football in HS?  Nope, I'm a dude.  I went to Georgia Tech and I had no idea we beat poor Cumberland 222-0 in 1916.
678,That's awesome!  I think it's sad when football players have to retire before they're ready due to injuries,That is terrible. I am grateful that ESPN created the superimposed yellow first down line.  That makes the game more exciting.
679,I agree. It makes the game much easier to follow for me. Makes it more clear whether the player made the first down.,Thanks for the excellent chat!  Good luck to the Bills!
680,Seems like the Redskins are in need of a wide receiver,Terrelle Pryor did struggle quite a bit.
681,Yeah he didnt catch on and the Redskins need something more, among the prospects are Alex Smith, Teddy Brigewater, I think they can be good options for the team,It seems like they have a lot of good prospects that were successful in college.  But they have been really lacking in that position for years
682,Yeah seems like they need each, maybe they can help each other get better they used to be great players so maybe they can recover their level,Maybe they just need a QB like Brad Johnson who once threw a touchdown pass, to himself.
683,Yeah or like Tom Brady, he didnt get a chance to play when he was a Junipero High School so he might identify with the wide receiver the team wants,It is kind of crazy that Brady didnt get that chance.  He really showed them!
684,He did, I bet the coach of the former Juniperra High School team felt really stupid when he saw Brady win all those superbowls, the JS High School team was really bad,Definitely.  Did you know there is only one left handed QB in the NFL
685,No I didnt, do you know the name of that QB?,Kellan Moore.
686,Oh so its Kellan Moore, I thought he was a righty, nice to know, do you know Baker Mayfield?,Didnt he almost leave football for professional gaming?
687,No, I think he was considering going it but stayed with football, he was a great Halo 3 player, I wish I could play against him I have mad skills too,I heard he thought he could beat everyone at his school, I have never played myself.
688,Yeah I did hear that too, he must be pretty good, good thing he stayed in football he is a great QB,,Did you know that the flags that span the field weigh 1,100 pounds and cost $50,000?
689,Thats really heave and also really expensive, $50000 a pop! thats way too much money,I wonder if there are just a few and they pass them around.  That is a lot of money, but they are also playing some of the players millions.
690,Do you like football? my favorite player is the quarterback,i like football. the player i hate the most is the quarterback
691,Why is that? what position do you like better?,i like defense. defense is most important on the field. they must be the toughest, the roughest, the best.
692,I agree, a QB is no good without a solid defence, so yeah they are really important,i figure that a good coach knows the value of defense in stopping those pesky qbs. the QB is a target. the QB is a meal the QB is for eating.
693,There are some great QB out there, even the best ones get sacked,I like sacking QBs! They never see it coming because they're behind the line.
694,Thats why they must have a great defensive line, do you know who Baker Mayfield is?,is he a QB? who is he?
695,He is a QB, he considered quitting football and become a pro gamer, apparently he is really good at Halo 3,he probably should stick to video games. that is the safe bet. career is much longer.
696,I agree, you can get really injured by playing football then theres also the brain damage,,the brain damage from video games is pretty bad too. i had a friend that played them too much. ended up about a simple as a retired player.
697,Really? I didnt know about that, but it makes sense, playing video games that long can have negative consequences for sure,the brain is a fragile organ, not designed to withstand hours of banal stimulation and entertainment. there should be a warning label on games about cognitive impairment.
698,There should be, but I doubg that will stop gamers, did you hear abouut the QB that created the circular huddle?,i have not heard that joke. whats the punchline?
699,Not a joke lol, he was a deaf QB that invented the huddle so that the other team wouldnt read his signals,oh, ok, that is cool. i thought you were telling a joke. he invented the huddle? the guy is a legend. anyway, great chat!
700,hey my friend do you have a favorite quarterback?,Well, I am not into football but I think I would be crazy to not say Payton Manning.
701,I like Brady myself, and I didn't know that Kellan Moore is actually left handed,I like Tom Brady as well. His Super bowl wins are so impressive.
702,ya I agree, did you hear the backstory to Baker Mayfield?,Yes, he once considered quitting football to game competitively.
703,ya, he made the right movie! Did you hear how the football huddle was created?,It was created by a deaf quarterback who did not want the other team to read his hand signals. I like knowing the reason behind the traditions.
704,ya me too, it is a genius thing, can't believe the highest football score of all time was 222-0, thats a blowout!,That sounds like an overpowered team having fun at the other teams expense.
705,ya, I would feel so bad to be a Cumberland fan that day! that was back in 1916 though,Football has changed a lot over the years and is even very different in different countries. I like the way they play football in Canada.
706,oh what is the difference in how they play there? I just think that it was great ESPN won an emmy for the yellow line they created for first downs in TV football games,They have a larger field in Canada. They also get ESPN in Canada and it is very popular.
707,ah interesting Ill have to look into that, do you like the Patriots? they have 1 player who actually has never fumbled the ball,Everyone loves the Patriots except those who have to compete next to them in the Super bowl. Was that Tom Brady who never fumbles the ball.
708,haha it was not it was Benjarvus Green-Ellis, I'd give him the ball every time!,Oh, I should learn more names from the team. Are the Patriots your favorite team?
709,yes I do love the Patriots, i'm just glad they make a lot of money too, unlike in the 60's where bowlers made more than nfl players!,Apparently the average lifetime earning of an engineer is higher than the average NFL player.
710,ya that is shocking, also shocking is there is no rule against female NFL players!,If a woman could meet the requirements then they would be eligible. I can imagine that would be very difficult.
711,The Browns have made a strategic move and are expeced to do well because of it.,I saw they agreed to trade to draft picks to the Dolphins.
712,Yes, Yes, and they got Jarvis Landry who led the NFL in the past season.,He had 112 catches last season. They also agreed to send a 3 round pick to the Bills.
713,They got Tyrod Taylor for that trade. It looks like a potential trade for Damarious Randall is still in the works.,Todd Haley will have a nice roster and plenty of potential.
714,The Browns might even get their pick of prized quarterbacks.,Wouldn't that be awesome? They are wondering if Taylor was the right selection. He was benched in favor of a rookie.
715,Yes, he did help to reach the playoffs but seems like he was in over his head against Jacksonville.,Taylor's just the temporary starter quarterback. They could draft Sam Darnold or Josh Rosen.
716,That is good. It seemed as if Taylor's performance is a bit unpredictable.,He started the last three season and only has 51 touchdowns. I would be a little leary. There's always room for improvement.
717,Why do you think they traded for Taylor?,He wasn't valuable to them anymore. They could get a new player who would pair well with the players.
718,It seems that they have several different choices for quarterbacks and that it's a step in the right direction.,Or what if they go with Penn State running back Saquon Barkley?
719,I don't know too much about him but it seems like that would be a surprise choice.,They wouldn't have their choice of quart backs.
720,Yes, but it seems they would still get one of them.,The consultant to the Browns, Scot McCloughan like Mayfield.
721,Yes, he likes Mayfield, but apparently Mayfield is polarizing. I wonder what that means.,He just has a presence about him like Lamar Jackson. People want to see him play because he all the great attributes.
722,Hello, The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC).,DId you know that they use tracking chips in footballs and shoulder pads in the NFL?
723,Not at all, what does this work for?,They use it in footballs to track velocity, rotation, ball speed and location.  In the shoulder pads they record players every move on the field
724,Go, they want to have all the movements calculated, this football is fantastic,If you visited iowa's locker room it is pink.
725,Yes, yes, I've heard a lot about it, I heard that they do it to scare other teams or show that they are better,That is strange!  Former patriots rb benjarvus green-ellis never fumbled in the nfl!
726,He's talented, I think that's what I think competitiveness,Do you watch favorite football games on Thanksgiving?
727,Yes, I am always aware of the matches,Predictions were that the Cowboys would beat the Redskins.  The Jaguars were stated to be an unreliable team in the NFL.
728,Wow, this team must have an excellent football behavior,Steelers Ben Roethlisberger ranks 8th in QBR
729,Well, they should improve if they want to occupy the first place,haha.  The huddle was created by a deaf quarterback to prevent his hand signals from being read
730,There are so many surprises everywhere,In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars
731,Seriously? There must have been more public on one side than on the other supporting the sport,Also the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl and average mlb player
732,Hey there! Are you a fan of the NFL?,Hello! I am! are you?
733,I am! Do you have a favorite team? I'm from Texas, so I'm obligated to root for the Cowboys!,Haha I am a Vikings fan! The Cowboys are fun to watch too! Can you believe there is only 11 minutes of actual gameplay?
734,No! That's wild! It's hard to follow on the TV sometimes, so thank goodness they created that superimposed yellow line for the first down.,Didn't that win an emmy for ESPN?
735,It did! A tv network won an award for TV shows!,Oh nice! I wish they had footage of that game that was 222-0 in 1916!
736,Right?! Back when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland,That would have been a sight to see. A very sad sight lol. Do you have a favorite quarterback?
737,Haha! I don't... None that still play anyway. Are you a Tom Brady fan?,Oh gotcha! I think he's a good player but I wouldn't call him my favorite haha.
738,Yeah, people disagree with his morals, I guess, haha! Did you know his JV coach didn't care much for him either?,He didn't even put them in when they were doing absolutely terrible! Jokes on him I guess!
739,Right? He went on to win 4 super bowls!,6 now actually lol. Do you ever think a girl will ever tryout for a team?
740,I'm not sure. I know they're technically allowed, and I would love to see that! It's just such a sexist industry.,It really is! I would love to see it too! The Saints are sexist about their cheerleaders as well!
741,I know, can you believe the cheerleaders are forced to get up midmeal if any NFL player walks in?,That is crazy! They need to update that like they do their technology! Anyways, it was great chatting with you!
742,Hey!  Do you follow football?,Hello!  I follow football as much as I can. Probably equal parts college and the National Football League.  How about you?
743,I tend more to the college side, but it is all good by me,I guess you might as well through in High School as well, especially if you are in Texas.  Allen,Texas, has a $60 million, 18 K seat high school stadium!
744,That is huge!  That team is probably pretty good to have that kind of facility.  Much better than Cumberland from 1916!,Tell me more about Cumberland.  Do they have a team anymore?
745,Im not sure, but they lost to Ga Tech 222-0 in 1916.,Wow.  It must be some sort of record.  Speaking of lovable losers, the Cleveland Browns returned to the NFL in 1999.  Despite playing eight home games per season, do you know who has the most wins in that stadium?  Opposing Steeler quarterback Ben Roethlsberger.
746,Wow, even more wins than the Browns?  That's sad.  My team, the Dolphins isnt much better though.,At least the weather is nicer.  Maybe you need a rocket science head coach.  Believe it or not, coach Matt Patricia actually is a rocket science!
747,Maybe he can figure out why it takes 3+ hours to play a game when there is only 11 minutes of active game play.,He should get right on that. They spend so much money already.  Players and even the footballs have tracking devices that record every movement on the field.
748,I wonder how they use all that data.  It seems like gathering it they should have a big purpose for it.,I am sure part of it is to ensure they are getting the most out of their investments. I wonder how that works for Russell Wilson who hasn't played baseball since 2011, but is still on an MLB contract!
749,Id like that kind of deal!,Amazingly he is also only one of two african-american quarterbacks to win a Super Bowl.  Doug Williams was the first.  Interestingly, they both got their wins over the Broncos.
750,That's pretty incredible.  I remember when Warren Moon played in the NFL for the Vikings, I think he was the first African American quarterback in the NFL, but not the first to win.,Some big name quarterbacks for sure, but none may ever reach Brad Johnson who actually is the only QB to throw a TD pass to himself.  It must have been tipped!
751,Had to have been, although I am curious to see the highlight reel for that one.,The NFL has definitely come a long way since.  I mean, way back in 1932 the first playoff game was actually played on a dirt-field in a hockey stadium that was only 80 yards long.
752,Wow, it certainly has.  Even recent years improving home viewing with replays and that yellow line.,I couldn't imagine a game without it and constantly have to remind myself the players can't see it!
753,Haha!  Me too, my mom was shocked when she went t my brothers first high school game years ago that the line wasnt there.,Lol.  I wonder what she would think if she found out that those big American flags in the stadiums cost like $50 K and weigh about a ton!
754,do you like football?,I love it . Did you know U of Iowa painted the visitor locker room pink?
755,I wonder if that is supposed to have some effect on the players,Good point. Bowlers made more in the 60s than football players
756,Yes I guess football was not as popular back in the day,True. Do you know the highest score in a college football game
757,Yes that was 222-0 when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland,Yes and that was way back in 1916
758,Yes. DId you know that ESPN won an Emmy once?,Yes that was for the superimposed yellow line
759,Yeah it has made gamewatching easier for sure,Yeah true. Do you like Brady?
760,I love him he is so good. Did you know he was a backup QB in high school,yes and they never started him even when they were doing really bad in the field
761,Yeah their loss. DO you like ALex SMith?,Yes I do, he is good at school too, finished college in two years
762,Yes he took lots of ap tests in high school and planned ahead,Yeah smart kid. Do you know who invented the circular huddle?
763,Yes Paul Hubbard who was deaf and did not want other to understand him,Yeah smart. It was nice chatting with you
764,Hello there, do you follow the NFL at all?,Hello, I love the NFL. What about you?
765,Yeah I follow pretty closely during the season, I thought the Super Bowl wasn't nearly as exciting as last year though.,This super bowl was so boring lol. Did you know Iowa painted the opposing team locker room pink?
766,Yeah it was and I think I heard about that!  Too funny, I wonder who came up with that idea in the first place?,Not too sure lol. The 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars.
767,That is pretty wild, I would have loved to been a bowler back then.  It also shows how much the NFL has grown since then.,I agree. Bowling stars probably don't make much these days.
768,No, and definitely not much compared to the salaries that pro football players now make.,Most definitely. The highest score ever in a football game was 222-0.
769,That is incredible!  I think I have read about that game, I think it was poor Cumberland on the losing side of that one.,That would be one very boring game to watch. I would have given up if I was on Cumberland.
770,Yeah those fans too, I wonder how many of the Cumberland faithful were still there when it ended.,I bet no one was still around lol. Green-Ellis went his entire football career without fumbling the ball.
771,That is very impressive, I wonder how many total carries he had in his career?,I bet he had a lot because he was a starter. I remember watching him with the Bengals. I'm a Bengals fan.
772,Yeah and if you have played for multiple teams chances are you have had your fair share.,I bet. Did you know the NFL uses tracking chips in players pads?
773,I have heard that, crazy how much tech is in the game now, do you think it will be used to improve safety?,I hope so. They track ball speed, velocity, rotation, and location. Nice chatting with you!
774,I was so glad The Patriots won the Super Bowl! They're my team because I lived in New England for awhile. Did you watch the game?,Yes, it was good. the game started off slow until the fourth quarter.
775,Yeah it was a pretty low scoring game. And I thought the halftime show was just as boring. Are you a Maroon 5 fan?,No, I was sure who they were until I looked them up online, I think the lights and fire display help their performance.
776,I knew of them, but I didn't know of any of their songs. What I think is funny is that the University of Iowa's locker room for the visiting football team is painted pink! That's sort of petty!,I agree, I guess they painted it pink especially for visitors, in a way of speaking visiting teams are weak.
777,Yeah exactly. And it's crazy how much football players are paid today compared to the 1960s when professional bowlers were actually paid more than football players.,Yes that's  true, back in the 1960s the players weren't protective as they are today with padded helmets and so many penalty calls.
778,Yeah I bet they had a lot of injuries! Also it shocked me to hear the highest football scoring game was 222-0! Ouch!,Wow, I wonder what kind of football team they were playing and what about the coach, what did he had to say?
779,It was college football, but if that happened in the NFL, they would be heckled for running up the score for like rubbing it into their competitor's faces. I guess that didn't exist back then.,Yes you are right and maybe I am wrong, but I think the coach wouldn't have any excuse to remain coaching that team.
780,Yeah that could be it too. And I also didn't know ESPN won an emmy for being the first channel to use the artificial yellow line to marks where the first down line. That really helps to know where the teams actually have to go to get a first down.,I didn't know that either, never cross my mind, yes I can't imagine playing on a team without known where the first down marker.
781,Do you have a favorite football team or are you not interested in football?,I like football, i like college football better than pro football. my favorite team pittsburgh, what about you?
782,My favorite team is the Patriots. I really think Tom Brady will be one of the best QBs in the hall of fame. It's crazy that in high school he was a backup QB and never got a chance to play.,Forgot, you did tell me your team earlier, yes, people think that the Patriots won too many games Super Bowls, but not really, talent is talent, their sixth ring.
783,Yeah the most Super Bowl wins ever. I wonder if that title will ever be broken.,I don't think so, because the Patriots always had a smart coach, come from behind team and a calm quarterback.
784,Are you a fan of the NFL?,Hey!  Yes I am a big NFL fan.  The Bears are my team!
785,Nice, they are just one of the 32 teams. sorry but I am a vikings fan....,Haha, my wife is a Vikings fan so I cheer for them too.  It is crazy to love a sport so much that only has 11 minutes of actual gameplay!
786,Nice good to hear that. That is so crazy to think only 11 minutes, I wonder what is the other 3 hours lol,A lot of filler and cheerleaders!  Fun fact I recently learned about cheerleaders, the Saints forbid their cheerleaders from eating in the same restaurant as any of their players.
787,That isn't too fun, it sounds kind of sexist, what do you think?,It is sexist for sure and wrong.  Interestingly enough, the NFL has no rule prohibiting female players!
788,I'm surprised!  I couldn't imagine that happening, but i did hear a female kicker may be the first soon,That would be cool.  I know some college teams have had female kickers.  Colorado is the biggest school to have I believe.
789,wow, I did not know that. My team is the Iowa Hawkeyes, they have a pink locker room for visitors,That is some subtle gamesmanship!  I actually went to Maryland.  Our recent coordinator hire, Matt Canada, had to take over the coaching duties last year.
790,Yea that was unfortunate on what happened with the player and coach being fired, sad to hear,Yes, a very sad story all around.  Canada was pretty good last season.  He set school records at Pitt for his offensive production.
791,Nice, I did not know that. I wonder if benjarvus green ellis played for him in college. He never fumbled once in his football career,That is a crazy stat!  It is amazing how far football has come.  At one point in the 1960s the top bowlers were making double the top football stars!
792,That is so crazy, now it pays to be an engineer though, they make more money in their lifetime than most players do,That is shocking!  I wonder if some players are actually really smart like Alex Smith.  He had so many AP credits, he was able to enroll in college as a high school junior!
793,That is crazy to think, and he became the first overall pick in 2005, smart man! Good chatting with you.,Nice chatting with you today too!
794,hi, do you watch nfl?,Hey, yeah I do.
795,did you now women can play too?,No, really? I thought it was just for men.
796,nope, if you make the cut, you play,That's cool. I hope to see a woman in the nfl one day. Do you think it's true Saints cheerleaders can't eat at the same restaurant as nfl players?
797,yeah but i totally diasgre with that rule. they have to even leave if they are mid meal,I know! That is insane.
798,did you know they make less than engineers?,I wonder how much engineers make because nfl players make a lot. Oh, I seen where the nfl uses tracking chips in player's pad and the footballs!
799,yeah that is really nice becuase they can get lots of useful statistics from those now,Yeah, I didn't know that. It makes sense how the announcer are able to view the replays and stuff.
800,yeah for sure. did you know there are only 11 minutes of gameplay in a game?,Yeah, and everything else is commercials and replays.
801,yeah exactly. you know what the highest score in football history is?,No, I'm not sure, what is it?
802,it is 222-0,That is insane! What teams?
803,georgia tech beat the cumberlands,yeah it is insane and boring I would assume,Very boring, a complete blow out.
804,Hello, do you play or watch football? (american football),Yea, it's funny how the Redskins were able to blow the NFC east lead after winning over Dallas earlier in the season
805,Haha, agreed. Did you know that Green-ellis has never fumbled a ball in his entire career?,That is pretty crazy, I remember Green-Ellis use to play for the Patriots, I don't think I've seen him fumble
806,Yep, imagine not fumbling a ball for your entire career. Must have been hard!,Yea, I wonder if the nfl was able to find out how he did it with the tracking chips they put into player's equipment
807,I wonder. They also put tracking chips in the football to track its velocity and rotations. Maybe that helps as well.,Possibly, it's amazing how much info they can get when the game only averages 11 minutes of live gameplay
808,Yeah. I wonder how people do not get bored while watching football.,I don't know, I wonder if that was why top bowlers made twice as much as football players in the 1960s
809,I wonder how they made so much. Engineers also make more than football players in their lifetimes.,I heard engineers make more than mlb players too, I guess paying attention in school pays off
810,Yep, although I am guessing that you have to be a veteran engineer to make that much.,I suppose so, I bet cumberland had a team full of engineers when they lost to Georgia tech 222-0
811,Well, that was back in 1916 but that still must have been a very embarrassing defeat.,Yea, tv wasn't even around back then but now we got yellow first down lines winning emmys
812,Did you know that Kellan Moore is the only left handed quarterback in the NFL?,That's pretty crazy but not as crazy as deaf quarterback Paul D. Hubbard
813,I wonder how he even communicated strategy with his team then.,Hubbard invented the huddle just to do so using hand signals
814,And to make it so that the other team could not see his hand signals. Anyways, thank you for your time! It was nice chatting with you!,You too, have a good one
815,Hi! Do you follow sports of any kind?,Not usually, but I do keep an eye on the NFL when it gets near the playoffs
816,So I take it you don't participate in sports gambling then? It's actually legal in any state that wants to pursue it according to a Supreme Court ruling, I had no idea!,I can understand that being a state level law though with how much money Nevada's government probably makes. The trends would be hard to predict though
817,Yeah, so far New Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia, and Mississippi have participated in it and legalized it and it's also open to NCAA as well as pro sports as well. Seems so risky though!,Definitely! I'd much rather watch the game for enjoyment than bet my money on anything. I went to a few high school games back in the day. Their fight song wasn't nearly as cool as the one Snoop Dogg would have written for his son's team
818,Yeah, I think I would feel so antsy and suffer from immense tachycardia if I were to place money on the outcome of a game. I wonder if players are paid "side money" to throw the ball a certain way or purposefully not catch it when there's sport betting involved.,Probably not, but there may not be a way to find out for sure. Quarterbacks typically make enough to not need side money. I guess it pays to be the leader of the offensive team if you make it to the NFL
819,Yeah that's true but may not be so true if it was still back in the 60s because top bowlers back then made twice as much as top football stars did! I don't even think bowling gets broadcasted anymore, does it?,It might if you have all the expensive ESPN channels. Football has become a big deal over the decades though, to the point that there's a stadium in Texas that seats 18,000 and cost $60 million to build. The most shocking part is that it's a high school stadium
820,A high school stadium?! It really is true, everything sure is bigger in Texas, even stadiums! ESPN won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line that represents the first down for football, I didn't know they created that.,It sure is helpful in watching the games though. They spend $50,000 for the huge American flags at football stadiums. In addition, it takes a lot to lift all 1,100 of the flag
821,Yeah good point. I wonder when the athletes train at those nice stadiums whether or not their egos are affected. Who's job is it to lift those flags?,I'm not sure. I wonder if all the stadiums have them. Of the largest stadiums, 14 of 25 are for college teams
822,Oh ok, I didn't realize flags were that expensive! Wonder if they're locked up somewhere each day. I would think that even though the NFL has no written rule against female players, it would be difficult for females to meet the league's physical requirements in order to play.,It would be a risk to get tackled. The only professional football I see girls playing is association football, also known as soccer
823,Yeah! I think there might be a lot of controversy surrounding that if females had played but considering that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the lifetime earnings of an nfl player, it might not be worth the risk afterall,Engineering is another field that has a sparse number of women (pun intended). Have you ever heard of the quarterback Brad Johnson?
824,Lol, that's a great observation! No, I'm not familiar with Brad Johnson, what is he known for besides being a quarterback?,Not only did he win the Super Bowl, but he's also the only quarterback to throw a touchdown pass to himself
825,Oh wow! That's an amazing feat! I don't think even Tom Brady has one of those under his belt.,No, but he does have six Super Bowl rings. There's only one quarterback in the NFL who is left handed
826,Hi, do you like football?,I do, I dont follow too closely though, you?
827,I love football. Did you know Iowa painted the opposing team locker room pink?,I heard about that.  Personally, I think its a bit childish, but whatever works for them
828,I think so too. In the 1960's, the top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars.,That is shocking, I wonder what the pay was back then?  I didnt realize bowling was ever that popular.
829,I never realized that either. Pretty amazing.,It really is, but not as amazing as Benjarvus Green-Ellis, who have never fumbled the football.
830,That's pretty amazing and hard to do as a running back.,Yeah, of course he was on the Patriots too
831,Of course lol. The highest score ever in a football game was 222-0.,WOW!  I cant believe one team could  score that many points!
832,I know. I bet that was a very boring game to watch!,Not if you were a GA tech fan.  lol
833,LOL - very true. Did you know an average NFL game is only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay?,Yeah, that sees so little for the amount of time it takes to actually watch a game.
834,For sure. The NFL uses tracking chips embedded is shoulder pads.,I heard the ball has them too!  That is so cool!
835,Very cool. They track ball speed, location, velocity, and rotation.,I hope they can use that data to also improve player safety.
836,I enjoy the NFL. How about yourself?,I love watching it!  I watch all 17 weeks during the regular season.
837,I agree. Did you know that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are actually higher than that of an NFL player?,I did not. But it makes sense.  There is only 1 left handed QB in the NFL - Kellan Moore.
838,I'm surprised there are not more but since you mentioned it I do not recall seeing a QB throw left handed.,I can only remember Michael Vick being a left handed QB.  I'm sure there were some more at some point.
839,I forgot he was left handed. Did you hear about the sexist policy the Saints have towards their cheerleaders?,I didn't.  Tell me more about it?
840,They are forbidden from eating at the same establishments as players. If the cheerleader was there first and already eating and a player enters, they have to stop eating and leave.,I wonder if we will see a female player any time soon.  There is no written rule against them playing in the NFL.
841,I had heard that. It would be difficult with a lot of positions because of the size of the players but I see no reason why we have not had a female kicker.,I agree!  Did you know that the average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay?
842,Wow! That seems like very little. I knew there were a lot more commercials and setting up and reviewing plays than gameplay but that is an extremely small amount of time.,I know.  That's what I thought.  Did you know that the circular huddle was created by a deaf QB so that the other team couldn't see his hand signals?
843,I did not. I would think it would be very hard to be a deaf QB. You would not be able to hear play changes or calls in your helmet.,hahaha right!  Baker Mayfield almost quit football to pursue a full time competitive gaming career.  I would never do that.
844,That seems like a bad idea in the middle of your career. If he stays good though he has a second career ahead of him and that's always a good idea.,I agree.  Are you familiar with the QB Alex Smith?
845,I am. I was sad to see him so severely injured.,I agree.  I think he will be back in time for next season.  I was suprised at how educated he is.  He took so many ap tests in high school it allowed him to enter college as a junior.  He then got his bachelor's degree in 2 years!
846,hi how are you today? do you like football?,Yes, I go to the games! Do you? What do you think of Baker Mayfield?
847,i have never been to a game. the tix are quite expensive. id love to go one day. what team do you like?,Patriots and the Bucanneers!  Did you know there is no rules that women can play football in the NFL?
848,i guess if they have the strength and speed. ive never seen a woman like that though.,I know Maybe a kicker would be okay!  What teams do you watch?
849,a kicker? maybe. can women kick as far a men? i try to watch the playoffs so whatever teams are in the playoffs are the ones i watch.,Oh I see, okay, Thinking only if she's a very strong girl! lol At least she wouldn't get hurt. Did you know there is only one left handed quarterback? Kellan Moore
850,that is an odd fact. i guess the lefties are unusual for a reason? does the offense have to shift for a lefty?,I guess not, A deaf quarterback created the huddle, so they couldn't read his hand signals.
851,that is a clever way to keep plays secret. he was an innovator.,Do you know who RB Bejarvus Green-Ellis is?
852,No i dont. is he famous? rb = running back?,Hes is so talented he has never fumbled the football in his NFL career.
853,that is a tremendous feat. he must be the only player like that! does he have giant hands or something? LOL he should get a bonus.,lol, right! Have you played Halo 3?
854,no i havent but i hear it is a challenging game. have you?,Very little, QB Baker Mayfield claims he can beat anyone at the University of Oklahoma.
855,he is probably quite good then. i have heard that you can make money at games now. anyway, great chat!,Yes, its been interesting.
856,Thanks! Have a great day!,You too! Good chat!
857,Are you a fan of either the Redskins or Cowboys?,I am a fan of neither. Are you a fan?
858,I do like the cowboys and their running game will make things complicated for the Redskins,I guess that's a part of football that I will never understand. Why run the ball when you can throw it oh so very far?
859,Well throwing the ball can result in an interception and if you have great RB then its better to ran the ball, its a safer play,I guess that is true, but what is the running person bobbles the ball? I've heard that bobbling is a big error in the football.
860,Yeah they can also fumble the ball, well if you have a RB like Benjarvus Green Ellis then that wont happen,I guess he has big hands then? Does he wear special gloves? He must be the best ball runner in the history of NFL?
861,He must or had a magnet for footballs in his hands, and I think his one of the best, I think his one of the few if not the only one to never fumble the ball,He is a miracle man. He must teach his secret technique to the others.
862,He must yeah, share his knowledge with others, do you like the ESPN network?,He could use the ESPN networks to share the knowledge! That is the greatest of ideas! He will be a hero to the many running men in the league!
863,He must be a role model to many RB out there, no doubt, and ESPN won an Emmy because of football,ESPN, is that the Spanish network? ESPaNol or something? I don't really speak spanish so I don't know them.
864,Not sure what it stands for, but its also popular in america, well they created the first down line,I guess the lines are important to the game. I figure the running man with the big hands carrying the ball can benefit greatly from the Line of the First Down.
865,Yeah I share your point of view, did you know bowlers used to make more money than pro football players!!,I guess it is a way to a football career. Start as a bowler, make the money, then become the football player. The ball is heavy in bowling so the hands get big for become the running ball man!
866,Yeah I guess thats a good idea, maybe bowlers also have tracking chips like in football,The bowlers use the tracking chips to find their way to the ball? What are the tracking chips for?
867,Hi!,Hi there!
868,I had to giggle about Junipero Serra High School, who refused to start their back up QB despite failure after failure. That QB was Tom Brady!,That's too funny.  Are you excited about Super Bowl weekend?  Not sure who to root for.  Was initially thinking the Seahawks might make it this year.
869,I root for the team who is not the Patriots, but they will probably win anyway. Although for a while I was pumped that the Colts were making a good drive. Andrew Luck had a career-high passes.,Ha!  I know what you mean.  (Did you read about that kid who did a science fair project that proved Tom Brady's a cheater?)   But yeah, Andrew Luck has a pretty good year considering his surgery.
870,I did read about the science fair kid! HA! Brilliant! Luck has a strong defense to help the team as well.,Marlon Mack, also coming back form injury did a lot to help the Colts out as well.  Man they had a good team this year.
871,It gives me hope for the future! Sure miss Peyton haha! I loved watching him. Although there is really only 11 minutes of live game play on the average game. Seems longer! ha!,Yeah, I read that.  It's pretty amazing that it's only 11 minutes.  But just taking a look at the Super Bowl, it does seem like more commercials than anything else.  Wonder what the first Super Bowl was like.  Think that was in 1966.
872,The commercials are a show of their own!,Yeah, but you know what I find interesting during the game.  Call me a geek but I like that superimposed yellow line representing the 1st down.
873,Yes! That's the one ESPN won an emmy for creating!,Heck yeah, they deserve an Emmy for that.  Keeps me interested and focused.  Guess ESPN and the NFL need to find ways to keep viewers.  All about the business/money I guess.  Gotta pay those athletes right?
874,It would be a riot if athletes didn't get paid. Although back in the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as even the biggest football stars. Hard to believe, ha!,Yeah, weird.  I had heard that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player.  Ha!  Guess I can tell that to my daughter.  Not that she'd play in the NFL.
875,Right! She could play if she wanted to though. She just has to meet the league's eligibility requirements! I'm not sure what those are, but it probably includes being 300 pounds and 6 foot 5.,Ha!  Yeah, that's not in our family genes.  She's more of a cheerleader type.
876,Nothing wrong with that! Probably safer.,Someone told me though, New Orleans Saints cheerleader aren't allowed to eat in the same restaurant as any NFL player.
877,hi, do you watch NFL?,Hi! Yes, did you watch the recent Superbowl game?
878,I did, the whole 11 minutes of gameplay,I think that's how long actual game play is! It was a very dull game in my opinion. I was ready for some action, like edge of seat tiebreaker but was a bit disappointed.
879,Yeah as were most people. did you know women can play too?,I think women can play, at least it's not against the NFL rules, but I have yet to think of any women who can meet the physical requirements for eligibility. Do you know how many pounds you have to be at least in order to play?
880,I have no idea maybe that is one of the reasons why they do not play,Yeah, it could be. The NFL's actually the highest professional level of American football in the world, I don't think I've ever heard of them drafting players from other countries like they do for other sports.
881,That is true. did you know about thet rule that applies to new orleans cheerleaders?,No, what's the rule for the New Orleans cheerleaders?
882,they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players,what?! there seems to be some gender disparity treatment with that rule. I think they should revisit that rule and change it, I wonder why that is, do you know?
883,I have no idea but the worst part is of the cheerleader is eatingn they have to get up and leave,That's a little overboard, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that there is something wrong with that rule. Speaking of rocket scientist, Matt Patricia who is a coach in the NFL was actually a rock scientist before he started coaching for the NFL!
884,that is soo cool. good for her. the university of iowa's locker room is pink. i wonder why though,To remind the players to be tough and play tough! I don't know, I'm just taking a wild guess since the NFL uses tracking chips to record the players every move on the field.
885,I have no idea. do you know who benjarvus  green-ellis is?,No who is that? That is an odd first name though, I wonder if his nickname is Ben or something because that is definitely not a common first name!
886,he is a former rb who never fumbled in his nfl career,Never fumbled? That is an amazing feat! That almost ties with the accomplishment of Brad Johnson who is the only quarterback in NFL history to throw a touchdown pass to himself!
887,do you like the NFL?,Yes I do. Did you know that women can play?
888,Yes there is no written rule that would prevent them from doing so,Yeah as long as they meet the requirements they are good to go
889,Yes. Did you know there are only 11 minutes  of gameplay in a game?,Yes and yet we are glued to the tv for hours watching one game
890,True. Engineers make more over the lifetime than football players,True. Did you hear of that rule for Saints cheerleaders?
891,Yes they are not allowed to eat in the same places as the players,Yeah, and worst, they have to leave mid meal if the players walk in
892,Yeah I think it is sexist and it really needs to go,I agree. Do you like Brady?
893,I do. In high school he was a back up QB for his team,Yes and he was not started even when they were doing really bad
894,Yeah their loss Do you like Alex SMith?,Yes he is a great player and super smart, finished college in two years
895,Yes and started his masters before he was even picked in the draft,Yeah such a well rounded kid. Do you know who invented the circular huddle?
896,Yes that was Paul Hubbard who did not want the other team to understand his signing,Yeah smart one. Nice chatting with you
897,hey there, do you watch football?,Hi!  I do watch football... I used to be a big St. Louis Rams fan, but since they moved to Los Angeles I am no longer a fan.  I still play fantasy football every year, which keeps me engaged with the rest of the league.  I also enjoy college football a lot too.  How about you?
898,Yes not as much but I do watch the games from time to time. do you have a favorite player?,My all-time favorite players were some of the Rams old players like Kurt Warner, MArshall Faulk, and Isaac Bruce.  Nowadays, I really enjoy watching Patrick Mahomes play.  He was my quarterback on my fantasy team so I saw many of his games and highlights.  He is incredibly exciting and it's nice to see new young talent injected into the league.  Aaron Rodgers is also very fun to watch, but unfortunately, I think his best may be behind him.  How about you?  Any favorite teams or players?
899,I do not have any favorites per say since I am not a regular fan but I was reading that women can also play if they can qualify,Absolutely!  There are no rules that prevent women from being in the NFL.  Do you think a woman will ever play in the NFL?
900,I do not know we just might have to wait and see if any of them try to make the cut,I think the first time we see a woman play in the NFL will be as a kicker.  Kickers don't have to tackle and take hits like the rest of football players do.  However, I could see a very strong woman actually attempt to play a different position.
901,Yeah me too, why not, there are very tough women out there. Have you heard about the new orleans cheerleaders and that strange rule?,I feel like I've heard about it, but I can't remember the details... can you give me the rundown?
902,yeah, they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant with the players,That's really weird... what is the reasoning behind this?  I will admit, the NFL is an extremely poor run "organization."  Lots of corruption, dishonesty, and unethical behavior.  Teams, such as the New Orleans Saints are also pretty unethical.
903,I really have no idea. And the worst is, if the players walk in and they cheerleaders are eating, they have to leave,That is very degrading to the cheerleaders.   It's not like there are safety concerns or anything... They're in a public place.  I can understand they not wanting the players and cheerleaders alone together, but it seems like there is a very small chance of something bad happening.  Seems like the players just have a superiority complex.
904,Yeah for sure. Do you know how mych game play time there is in a game of football,If I remember correctly, each quarter is 15 minutes long and there are 4 quarters to a game.  Did you watch any of the Super Bowl last week?
905,Yeah and apparently out of all that, there is only 11 minutes of active game play,Yeah, it's pretty pathetic, haha.  There is a couple seconds of action and then several minutes of standing around.  It can still be very exciting at times though; much more than some other sports.  Baseball is pretty bad with a lack of action and lots of standing around.
906,Yes, very true. Did you know nfl players make less money than engineers?,Good, they don't deserve to make as much as engineers.  Engineers actually do something productive for society.  NFL players play a game and then generally don't contribute much to society.
907,Do you watch the NFL?,I do sometimes. How about you?
908,Every week I try to watch. Did you know that there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay?,I know and that seems crazy knowing how long a game actually is.
909,Yeah, it seems like they mostly stand around, but that might just be me.,Another crazy thing is the Saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating  in a restaurant with any nfl player. If they are already eating and players walk in they have to leave. That must be an old time rule.
910,It isn't that out of the ordinary of a policy, the redskins have the same one.,I don't know it just doesn't seem fair, but what is cool is that there is no law prohibiting a woman from playing in the NFL if she meets requirements.
911,Yeah, there were players in high school. I wonder how people would react though if one got injured very badly.,And I am left handed and I find it pretty cool that Kellan Moore is the only left handed quarterback in the NFL.
912,Yeah, that surprised me that there is only one left handed qb in the NFL.,Hey it makes him unique and makes him stand out
913,Yeah, I wonder if it is due to the offense having to adjust.,Some football stuff I find funny, like the university of Iowa's visiting locker room being pink. They must hate being in there
914,Yeah, some it is funny. I think they do that to intimidate the opposing team.,They probably do. And did you know that Benjarvus green ellis never fumbled a ball in his NFL career. That is awesome.
915,WOW! No I didn't. He must have glue for hands!,He must be hated by the opposing team for sure.
916,I'm sure they've taken note of him. Did you know that in the 60s bowlers made more than NFL players?,That seems crazy but you don't see a lot of bowling anymore. Did you know the highest score in a football game was 222-0. How is that even possible.
917,Hi how are you?,Im great do you like football?
918,Yes I do! do you?,I do as well my favorite team is in the AFC, what about yours?
919,I am a Steeler fan, whats your team?,I like the Patriots, I guess we are tied in Superbowl winds as of a Sunday ago.
920,Boo! haha did you know theres no written rules against females in the nfl?,I didnt know about that, I guess its logical not to let them play, men tend to be a lot stronger and it wouldnt be fair
921,Only thing I can see is if some beast soccer player wants to try out for a kicker position.,Yeah that would be different and would be a great fit for the team for sure, I think football is a great sport 32 teams, 16 in each division and each of them with great players
922,Did you know there is only an average of 11 minutes of live gameplay per game?,I didnt, that doesnt seem like a lot, I guess ads take over the screem, whats your favorite position?
923,Probably running back. I never played football, I was mostly into soccer. whats your favorite position?,I like the QB position, Im guessing you know who Tom Brady is?
924,Yea I obviously hate him, but unfortunately I cant doubt he is the best. Funny that he never started on his high school team.,It is funny I guess the coach never knew what he had on the bench until years later when he saw him play.
925,He probably felt like an idiot.,Yea I agree its not common to have a hall of famer in your team and never use him, he did lose almost everygame that season
926,Thats too funny. Did you know there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl?,Really? Only one? whats his name?
927,His name is Kellan Moore!,Oh Kellan Moore, he is a great player, imagine being a football player and loosing by 222 points? well that happened back in 1916 poor Cumberland
928,They must have fallen asleep or something.,I  agree, something was up in that game, football is a game with a lot of interesting facts and stats, you know ESPN won an emmy because of football
929,I did not know that. They deserve it!,I think they did, the yellow line has changed football forever, it sounds like something simple but its has change things for sure
930,Seriously! It was nice chatting with you if this ends ever!,Its been nice chatting as well
931,Have a great day!,You too bye, and good luck to the Steelers this season
932,Hi are you a football fan?,Yes I do. Did you know that women can play in the NFL too?
933,I see that.  The University of Iowa painted their visitors locker room pink.  Wonder why?,Yes me too probably it is supposed to have some effect on the other team
934,In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars of the day.,Yes I guess football was not that popular of a sport as bowling was back then
935,You're right.  Do you know what the highest score ever was for a football game?,Yes that was 222-0, quite the game and do you know who was playing?
936,Whoa!  Who was playing in that game?,It was Georgia Tech that beat Cumberland in 1916
937,What a blowout!  ESPN won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow first down line that we now see on tv.,Yes to be honest it has made game watching much easier now
938,I agree!  Former Patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled the football in his NFL career.  Impressive.,that sure is. Alex SMith also finished college in two years, and is a great player
939,That's impressive!  Baker Mayfield once considered quitting football to pursue a full time competitive gaming career.  Crazy if you ask me. lol,I know right? He still claims that he is great at Halo 3 and can beat anyone at U of Oklahoma
940,Nice!  An average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.  Kind of short for a game they stretch out to 3 hours. lol,yes it certainly feels like forever. Do you know who invented the circular huddle?
941,Was it a deaf QB named Paul Hubbard?  It's been good chatting,Same here, have a good one
942,Hello! So do like football?,I do, I'm a big Bills fan.
943,I don't follow the NFL much but yeah, I like the Bills. Was reading that Josh Allen,Their quarterback situation has always made me mad, but they've done good with Josh Allen in his rooking season.
944,That's what I hear, it was looking like the Bill's was considered the worst team of the season. Not sure how that all worked out though, if it changed.,They weren't the worst with their 6-10 record. They ended up 3rd in their conference behind the Patriots and Dolphins. If they can make some moves this offseason to get some linemen to protect him and a receiver or two they'll be doing really good.
945,Oh, that's great! Hopefully they can get everything set right. Well I have heard Allen is very talented but by drafting Allen was a risk. Sounds like they didn't do too bad at all.,Yeah it was a risk, they had already picked up a quarterback in the last draft and alot of fans were perturbed about it. I really wanted them to stick with Tyrod Taylor, who got them into the playoffs the year before, but they traded him to the Cleveland Browns.
946,Oh, that sucks. my guess is they will get their act together and get back to normal. So do you play football?,I did in high school, but now only on Playstation.
947,Oh, that's cool. Never been a football player type. I love Basketball though. But I am female so not very smart to play football lol, although I heard the NFL has no problem with women playing as long as they meet requirements.,I wonder why no women have tried to play in the NFL. With the way some teams treat their cheerleaders I can see why they wouldn't want to.
948,Exactly, I definitely wouldn't want to be a cheerleader for the Saints....can't even eat in the same restaurant as the team.,That is so unfair. Even if they're already dining in the restaurant and a NFL player comes in they are required to leave. I wonder why?
949,I think it is ridiculous lol, and I can't think of a reason for that. They probably want to talk shop and don't want anyone to hear them, not sure.,I'm going to have to research this. I'm intrigued. I mean the players on play on average for 11 minutes, I'm sure the cheerleaders are more active than that. They should be held at higher regard.
950,I agree! I was thinking of researching this rule too. That's not right and makes me wonder if that is the only team that does it....or all of them.,Apparently it's league wide with ridiculous rules. That's horrible. Did you know that average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an NFL player?
951,Seriously? Wow, never thought that could even be possible for anyone to make more money than an NFL player! I did hear that in the 60's bowlers made twice the money as top football players, that's nuts,I'm guessing the average NFL player isn't in the league that long and most engineers don't retire until they're in their 60s.
952,True! The engineers work a lot of years so I can see that. But I thought football stars made millions?,They do, the average pay is like $1.7M and the average length of career is around 3 years. I think Engineers on average are around $100,000-150,000 so I guess they can catch up once the NFL player is out of the league.
953,Wow, that's a lot of money. I bet being a QB makes more money I would think. Well enjoy your Football on your playstation! It has been a great chat!,I've enjoyed it too, I hope you have a great evening!
954,How's it going, do you follow Football? Did you know the QB usually touches the ball on almost every offensive play?,Did not know that. Did you know Brady was a back up QB in high school?
955,Yea at Junipero Serra High School. It's pretty mindblowing his JV coach never started him despite the team never even scoring a touchdown,Yeah, their loss I guess. Did you know Alex SMith wrapped up college in two years?
956,Yea, Smith was a pretty smart student, able to start college as a junior from all the AP tests he passed,Yes and then got started on his masters before he was picked on the 2005 draft
957,Smith sounds a lot smarter than Baker Mayfield. Mayfield considered giving up millions playing football to be a competitive gamer,Yes he claims that he is super good at Halo 3 and can beat anyone at U of Oklahoma to it
958,Maybe left hander Kellan Moore could beat Mayfield at some Halo 3,Could be, you never know. Do you know who invented the circular huddle?
959,Yea, Paul D Hubbard in order to prevent opposing teams from stealing his hand signals,Yeah and he was deaf himself so that was genius on his behalf
960,That's pretty impressive, I wonder if the NFL will ever have female players since there is no rule preventing it,I wonder too. I do not think I have heard of anyone trying for it at least.
961,I've heard of female players at the high school level, but none that played college or in the NFL,Yeah. Did you know that there are only 11 minutes of active game play during a game?
962,No but that might help explain why an Engineer makes more on average than an NFL player in their respective lifetimes,Good point. What do you think of that rule where Saints cheerleaders cannot eat in the same place as the players?
963,Sounds pretty antiquated and sexist, I have no idea why the Saints still enforce that rule,I agree completely with you there. On a different note, they are using tracking chips on the players during games now
964,Hello, do you watch the NFL?,I do, I love football, what about you?
965,Yeah me too. Did you know women can also play if they meet the requirements?,I didnt, it does seem unfair, football is a game of strengh and men tend to be stronger.
966,Yeah I guess. But maybe everyone can last in a game with only 11 minutes of play time,That fact is a bit odd, only 11 minutes of gameplay? thats not much, noth much at all
967,Yeah I know, pretty short. Did you know engineers make more than football layers over their lifetime?,I didnt know that but it does make sense, engineers work for a long time football players have short careers.
968,Yeah that is true. Did you hear about that rule for the New Orleans cheerleaders,I did, that rule is so unfair and sexist, I hate it, the Saints should change that immediately,
969,I agree there completely. The worst part of it is that they have to leave mid meal if the players walk in.,That is the worst part, did you hear about the tracking chips footballs have,?
970,Yeah I hope they can use that data like velocity and rotation to make the game a little safer too,That would be a great use of the data, football can be a risky game full with injuries, a lot of the players end up with brain damage
971,Yeah exactly. Did you know ESPN won an Emmy once?,I didnt, why did ESPN win an Emmy award? I though Emmys were only for the music business I guess I was mistaken
972,I thought so too, but they won it for the superimposed yellow line.,I guess that was a really important contribution to the game not sure if it deserved an Emmy though,
973,Yeah not sure either. DO you know what the highest score in football is?,No maybe 80 to 7? or 120 to 3? I have no idea, Im just guessing here,
974,Do you watch much football?,I catch it when I can, mainly into college ball.  How about you?
975,I watch a little of pro ball but not a ton. College ball always seemed way more intense to me.,It does, I think it is because you are playing solely for pride.
976,So true. Plus they can get away with fun stuff like silly pranks and not have the media in their face or huge fines.,Like painting a locker room pink.  lol
977,Only in Iowa I swear. Speaking of college rivalries that one between their two college teams is crazy intense.,Really?  I guess you would have to be near it to know.  here in Florida UF and FSU can get pretty heated.
978,That is the gators and the seminoles right?,Yeah.  I went to FSU so I am a bit invested, but honestly dont care too much.
979,I'm hoping that the NFL shares some of the chip tech with college teams so we can get more data about hits and ball spin. I really like the math and science side of it.,It is fascinating indeed  I think it could be used to prevent injury too and develop better safety equipment.
980,It would be great if they could use that data to make helmets better to avoid concussion injuries.,I think they have started some work on things like that with the placement of the inner padding.
981,Now if we can also get rid of the horrible attitudes towards cheerleaders on some teams it would be golden.,That would be great!  I cant blame females for not running at the chance to play in the NFL with they way the treat the cheerleaders.
982,I can't even imagine trying out. Technically they could but I bet the coaches would make it hard as possible for them to make it.,Very true, the requirements might be prohibitive themselves.
983,At least they aren't throwing them out because some male players show up. Those poor new orleans cheerleaders. I can't imagine putting up with that.,I wonder if it is like that all around the league?
984,It seems like it depends on the team. I'm sure that there is probably a reason for it but it seems super sexist. Especially in this day and age.,For real.  I dont know what could have happened to spur a rule like that.
985,Who knows. Probably some scandal between a QB and a cheerleader. It always seems to be the QB in trouble.,It does, but then there are some like Alex Smith who just lead the charge and stick around to get a masters.
986,I think it is amazing when they stay in college instead of just depending on a pro career. Shows really forward thinking and plan for when football is no longer an option.,It does, so many players go broke 5 years after they retire, something like 60%
987,Wow that seems crazy to me because you think they make all this money but it is only for those few years so most jobs actually bring in more.,Like being an engineer you will make more in a lifetime, you have to work longer, but you make a lot more overall.
988,Hey what do you think about DJ Moore? How good do you think he is?,I haven't seen or heard too much about him.  Hes up with Washington right?
989,Yes he is, he is a wide receiver. And he normally works well with the quarterback Kyle lauletta, they play at the Cole Field House by the way,Wow.  I think it is great that there are a bunch of good up and coming players.
990,Yes I agree, they definitely got a good draft last year, what do you think about the NFL in general by the way, how often do you watch it,I dont watch too much, there is only 11 minutes of live action.  I dont have time to spend 3 hours watching a game for 11 minutes.
991,Nope I agree. That's why I don't like sports because I think that they are really boring personally. On the other hand though, what do you think about females playing for the NFL,They dont treat cheerleaders well, so I dont imagine that they would treat female players well either.
992,No I agree with you. I think it's really dumb how a female cheerleader would have to leave restaurant if a male player walked inside, that seems very dated,It really does, I wonder why that rule exists, or if it is even enforeced.
993,I think it is enforced unfortunately, do you know any Engineers by the way? Apparently an engineer will make more over their lifetime then a professional NFL or NBA player which is incredible to me,I know few.  None that are paid that highly, but it is cool that engineers have that earning potential.
994,yup thats cool! what do you think about the team that painted their locker room pink ?,I think it is a bit childish and in a way toxic.
995,Yes I agree. I wonder if they did better or worse after they painted it that color? What do you think about the Patriots player who's never fumbled the ball? He sounds amazing,It is leaders like him and Brady that really make that team what it is.  I doubt anyone else will ever be able to do that.
996,Yep it takes a special person to be that good. It also takes a special team to set a record for the most points scored in a football game LOL did you hear about that game,Yeah, it is hard to believe.  How can you even score that many 222, that explains why the other team had 0
997,Yep they must have been so good, Georgia Tech was definitely on their game that day,Cumberland must have forgotten to get off the bus.. lol
998,Hello do you like football?,Not so much...are you a big fan of football yourself?
999,Not really.  I hardly watch anymore,  sometimes if the 49ers play.,Quarterbacks are one of the most popular players for football it seems. I cannot name any off the top of my head though. Can you?
1000,Tom Brady,  eli manning,  joe montana,  alex smith.Those last 2 arent current lol,I think it's interesting that Matt Patricia is a coach for football but yet he is also a rocket scientist. Really, how does he have time for football?
1001,maybe it pays better lol,That would make my day if I learned football would be a more lucrative profession than rocket scientist. What is the world coming to?
1002,I know right.  I would rather be a rocket scientist though,  I dont want to be costantly injured lol,That's true...although coaches and owners seem to be in the permanent safe zone! Did you know that Snoop Dogg wrote a fight song for his son's football team?
1003,Thats cool,  I wonder if it was any good lol,Well, that football team is one of the luckiest around to be involved with Snoop Dogg. I don't think they needed to do much fundraising for equipment at that school!
1004,I hear the former running back of the patriots never fumbled the ball Benjarvus green-ellis.,Wow a football player that NEVER fumbles the ball? That sounds like some sort of football god. Is he a quarterback?
1005,Running back.  not a quarter back. I know right,  really impressive,  I wonder why this guy isnt more well known.,Running back, quarterback, tight end. Those are about the only football positions I know...the last one sounds pretty funny, actually.
1006,I dont know many either,  only the common ones.  Espn won an emmy for the creation of the yellow line that tells you where there is a first down.,Even as hard as they try, in football or any other sport it can be hard to call. There is always human error. Differences of opinion, too, I bet...
1007,i recently read that the huddle was invented by a deaf quarterback.,Was that so the football players on the other team or other people couldn't see what the quarterback was signing? That's very clever, if so!
1008,Good Morning! Cool...love talking National Football League!,Hey there. Yes the NFL is an awesome organization. I watch the Super Bowl this year it was held on the first Sunday in February. But it wasn't that good of a game I thought.
1009,I like defensive games. I didn't watch it for the first time because I was protesting how the New Orleans Saints were screwed by the officials. But, that's me...,Yeah that was one of the worst no calls I have ever seen. Truly terrible. NFL uses tracking chips and players shoulder pads but they can't even review a call? Not OK.
1010,Yep....I don't know if you've been watching any Alliance of Football games, but they have a referee on camera that's supposed to catch a lot of those callls. I hope the National Football League brings that same approach to the games.,Yeah I definitely think the NFL should adopt that. They have no written rule against female players so why not have a referee on camera too.
1011,Agreed. I'm glad that Jacksonville is finally going to get rid of Blake Bortles with that Philly QB (can't remember his name). They should be a lot better with him.,Yeah I agree with you there. I remember the former patriots running back green ELLIS he never once fumbled the football.
1012,He was good. Strange he didn't last long with the Patriots. But, they also say in the AFC East that Sam Darnold looked good at QB, but I think Baker Mayfield was better for my team (The Browns). We finally have a Quarterback.,I hope your team does well in the future you guys definitely deserve it. I am also glad Baker Mayfield didn't pursue his competitive gaming dream. He makes a better football player I think.
1013,Yes, we are very excited about Baker Mayfield at Quarterback. The Cleveland Browns have been so pitiful for so many years. We have 21 year old kids that don't even know we ever had a good team?,Yeah well hopefully that will change LOL. Sometimes I forget that there are 32 teams in the NFL because we only hear about the same teams every year.
1014,If I have to hear the New England Patriots name one more time, I'm gonna barf! I hate that they are the one football team that are in the playoffs every dang year. Uggh!,I know it is very annoying. I really wish they didn't win the Super Bowl again. I would've really like to see the New Orleans saints win this year.
1015,Agreed. And that's why I didn't watch it for the first time ever. I was under protest (LOL...then again, I did bet on the Pats to win),Well it was a smart bet and I hope it paid off for you. It's kind of interesting that the New Orleans Saints cheerleaders can't be at the same restaurant as any NFL player.
1016,Probably a good idea....lol.....cheerleaders are the last thing a National Football League player needs to see when trying to concentrate on football. Those gals are too gorgeous!,I completely agree with you. Sometimes I would rather watch them in the game. Surprisingly though the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an NFL player and an average MLB player.
1017,Well, I'm glad they do! Engineers deserve more money than a sports player in baseball or the National Football League.,Yeah I agree with you. The football players just get injured too often which is surprising because there's actually only 11 minutes of live gameplay per game.
1018,do you watch football?,I sure do. Snoop Dogg once wrote a song for his son's team
1019,WOw cool. U of Iowa painted the visitor locker room pink,I wonder if that is supposed to have some impact on them
1020,I wonder too. Bowlers made more than football players in the 60s,Wow cool.  The coaches are the highest paid ever though in the states
1021,I bet. Do you know what the highest college football score is?,I am not sure, what game was that?
1022,It was Georgia Tech and Cumberland , 222-0,Wow what a score. Did you know Kellan Moore is the only left handed QB in the NFL?
1023,Cool. Do you like Brady?,I like him, he is good. Do you know Brad JOhnson?
1024,I have heard of him. Brady was a backup QB in high school,Wow a backup? Brad is the only guy to have thrown himself a touchdown ball
1025,Wow I did not know that was even possible,Me either. Only two african-american players have won the superbowl
1026,Wow. Baker Mayfield wanted to be a game player originally,Wow. Did you know the NFL is using tracking chips now?
1027,Cool what for? What are they collecting there?,They are collecting velocity and rotation and a bunch of other stuff
1028,Do you follow the NFL?  The LA Chargers lost to the Broncos 23-22 last week to win the AFC conference.,Hello,  No I didn't.  You keep up with football a lot?
1029,Not really.  I prefer watching the band!  But some fun facts about football are that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are more than the average nfl player and mlb player.,I read that too crazy!  Nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field. they are also located inside footballs to track: velocity, rotation, ball speed and location.
1030,That is way too much for me!  The huddle was created for american football when a deaf quarterback didn't want to give away hand signals,That's really considerate!
1031,In the 60's top bowlers actually made two times the amount as top football stars,Maybe bowling was much more popular back then. Matt patricia is the only rocket scientist coaching in the nfl. before coaching, he was a working aeronautical engineer who graduated from rpi: a school whose fight song includes "sin", "cosine" and "tangent", as well as six digits of pi.
1032,Smart guy!  I wonder if he visited the pink Univ of Iowa college football locker room,lol must be some sort of strategy or something,
1033,ESPN won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line for american football games.  That is cool!,Yeah! The first nfl playoff game was played in 1932 on an 80-yard long dirt field inside chicago stadium, then home to the nhl blackhawks.
1034,There was a Patriot football player named Green-ellis who never fumbled the football.  I guess they should pass to him!,Nice,  I wonder why that guy isn't that popular,  never heard of him.
1035,Not sure.  The highest scoring game racked up 222 points and the other team unfortunately got 0 when georgia tech won over cumberland.,wow!  Snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his son's high school football team.
1036,Alex Smith took so many AP tests in high school that he went in as a junior to college.,Wow that's impressive! Those humungous American flags at football stadiums weigh 1,100 pounds and cost $50,000 to make
1037,That's huge! Arizona is apparently doing worse in scoring than predicted for football.,That's unfortunate.  14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums belong to American college football teams.
1038,Give her watch High School football? Apparently Gonzaga and St John's are in the top 20 now,Does Gonzaga play quarterback for St Johns?
1039,I think Gonzaga is a team, but I'm not 100% sure I don't follow High School football that much, I only watched a local game when my nephew is playing LOL,I see. Then you probably know I do not watch high school football!  I really don't even watch the NFL. Do you?
1040,No I don't watch the NFL either. I do like Tom Brady though, that's the only thing I know is that he's really good LOL,I hear that ruby is a variation of football. It's even literally called rugby football in places.
1041,Yes I think you're right. I only like American football though. They also have Gaelic football and Canadian football,Sorry, meant Rugby, not ruby! I hear some of the stadiums have flags that weigh over half a ton. I wonder if they've ever fallen?
1042,Yeah I would be so scared if I saw that flag falling on top of me LOL. Did you ever hear about the highest scoring football game of all time?,I didn't, was it a very high score? I know it's a high price to build a football stadium. I've heard just a high school one can be sixty million!
1043,Wow that's insane! You think that a high school team does not need a football stadium that complex. Did you know that in the 60s top Bowlers made more than top football players though?,I like bowling more than playing football. One reason is that I like how you can practice alone because for football it's always teamwork, but bowling can be done alone.
1044,Yes I agree. It's also a lot less work to get a team together LOL. What do you think about ESPN winning an Emmy for the yellow line on TV?,I guess it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it was the best. I agree that schools spend too much on elaborate stadiums. Out of the 25 largest stadiums in the World, 14 are at American Colleges. I wonder what their food is like?
1045,Yes I'm curious too. I'm also curious why the University of Iowa painted a locker room pink, I wonder if they thought it would help or hurt them,I think they did it for just a joke, or I hope so. I know Snoop Dogg has a son that plays football. Have you ever seen him play?
1046,No I haven't seen him play. The song he made is really interesting though, you should look it up on YouTube,I haven't heard it, I will! I think quarterbacks tend to be popular players in football, although I'm not even sure what they do.
1047,Yes quarterbacks are the ones that touch the ball the most and also throw it to other players, Baker Mayfield is one of the most famous ones,I've heard that Kellan Moore is a famous quarterback in the NFL known for being left handed. He's the only one like that, it seems.
1048,do you like the NFL?,I love it. Did you know women can play too?
1049,Yes there is no rule on paper that prevents them from playing,Yeah if they meet the requirements they are good to play
1050,Yeah. Do you know how much gameplay is there in a game?,Yes it is actually only 11 minutes in total
1051,and yet we are glued to the tv for hours to an end,Yeah I know. Did you hear of the rule for the Saints cheerleaders?
1052,yes they are not allowed to eat in the same place as the players,Yeah and they also have to leave mid meal if they walk in
1053,SO sexist , I really think it needs to go,I agree Did you hear they are using chips on the players now
1054,Yes they are tracking stuff like velocity and rotation and such,I hope they can use that to make the game safer somehow
1055,Yeah . DO you like Brady?,I do. He was a back up QB in high school
1056,yeah and they did not start him even when they were not doing well,Yeah their loss. DO you like Alex SMith?
1057,I do. He is a good player and a super smart kid, finished college in two year,Yes took lots of AP tests in college and managed to do that
1058,hey there, do you watch NFL?,Hello there, I do follow the NFL, did you watch the SuperBowl this year?
1059,Part of it, how about you?,Yeah I kind of fell asleep at the end, but I woke up and saw I had won some money so I was happy.  Do you have a favorite NFL team?
1060,I do not have a favorite one. How about you? I like that they have no rule against woman who can also play in the NFL?,Yeah I think that is super cool, I really want a female player to make a team and play and the field soon.  I think it would be so great for all the young girls into sports.  And I follow the Packers.
1061,Yeah, I mean even the locker room for university of iowa players was pink.,Yeah isn't that hilarious.  I wonder how they got the ok for that to get painted in the first place.
1062,Yeah I wonder too. in the sixties top bowlers made twise as much as football players.,That is so funny, oh if I could have a choice to do it again, I would be a top bowler in the 60's.  I would have the life then.
1063,Yes so true. Did you know that ESPN once won an emmy?,Yeah I heard they won it years back when they came out with the yellow line shown for the first down line.
1064,That is so interesting. The highest score in football was scored when gerogia defeated cumberland.,Wasn't it a crazy score of over 200-0? I think I read about that one time.
1065,Yeah that is truly crazy. A former patriots rb never fubled the football in his nfl career.,I heard that. What was his name, I don't remember but know he played for the Patriots.
1066,His name was Benjarvus Green-Ellis. Pretty interesting.,Yeah that is amazing.  Do you know when the first NFL playoff game was held?
1067,No I do not know that. Do you?,It was way back in 1932! In Chicago stadium, and the field was basically dirt and only 80 yards long.  It was the same place the blackhawks played!
1068,Are you watching the Superbowl this year? wouldnt it be interesting to see a woman play for either team.,I'll probably watch it.  Are you? You know, the nfl doesn't have any rules against a woman playing.
1069,Yeah I just found about that though I dont we will ever see one at a pro level, I also didnt know the average game play is 11 minutes,I didn't know that either.  Next game i'm going to watch to see if that is true.  I do know, though, that there is only 16 regular season games.
1070,Really only 16 thought there were more games, so anyway whats your favorite football position?,Well, there is if you count playoffs and preseason.  Oh, and each time has a bye week.  My favorite position is either quarterback or wide receiver.  You?
1071,Mine is runningback, its been my favorite since I saw Benjarvus Green-Ellis play, so much talent.,I've never heard of him.  I'm old school and have to admit that my favorite running back was Tony Dorsett back in the day.  But now, as far as talent goes, there's some good players out there.  Baker Mayfield for example.  He's so talented at stuff he could even do professional video game playing!
1072,Yeah I know who Mayfield is, he is talented I heard he was pretty good at halo back in college.,Yep.  I like multifaceted players.  Alex Smith for example is reported to be very smart.  He was working on a master's degree before being drafted.
1073,Wow, I guess he is one of the few football players with a masters degree, that is admirable.,I think so too.  Football can be inspiring like that.  I mean, Tom Brady was a second string quarterback in high school and now look!
1074,I bet his coach didnt think he would get so far, his been in almost every superbowl since 2002,I agree.  I wonder what will happen with the Patriots when he retires.  The quarterback is the leader of the team and they don't seem to have a good replacement in place.
1075,I know, the QB is so influential that he touches the ball in every play, they are going to have a hard time finding a good replacement, not sure how the second string QB is right now.,Knowing that, teams need really good quarterbacks.  Did you know that Kellan Moore is the only left handed one?
1076,I didnt know that, football sure is a nice sport, there are many crazy stats like the one in which Georgia Tech defeated another team by 222 points,That is crazy! I would have loved to see that game! I bet neither team had any defense at all!
1077,Yeah, or the other team was probably full with blind people.,Maybe the home team should have tried to psych their opponent out like the University of Iowa does. They have the visitors locker room painted pink.
1078,Hi There ! Looking forward to chat with You ! ;),You too brah. Do you watch football? The NFL has 32 teams, the NY Giants are my favorite team
1079,I don't really watch... I'm from Europe - we watch football ( soccer ) ;)  Giants huh ? Where You're from ? All my neighbors are cheering for Giants ;),I'm from Connecticut, right next to NY. We don't have any of the 16 teams from the NFC or AFC in my state unfortunately
1080,ahh, I'm from Long Island NY, so I guess we're neighbors ;),I wonder if European Football uses tracking chips like how the NFL embeds them into shoulder pads
1081,Yeah I don't think so ;) I mean, I've never heard about that. I wonder what's the point...,I guess the NFL uses them to track the players movements and they also have them in the ball to track velocity, rotation, speed, and location
1082,Holy crap, so much data for running with the ball and passing it from time to time... :)  Hey I heard that the highest score in football was 222-0 ? Is that really high ?,Usually in the pros once you break into the 40s its consider really high, in College there will be a game once in a while that breaks into the 60's or 70s
1083,what... so how the hell did they do that ? 222 ? That's like 4 times bigger score than that...,Yea, It must of been the best team in College football at the time facing another college that's team had the skill equivalent of a high school team
1084,Are matches like that entertaining to watch ? Soccer matches are really exciting even with score 0-0,If the games are close in score they tend to fun to watch, if it's one-sided and you're not a fan of the high scoring team then no, that's why I don't really like college football 90% of the games aren't competitive
1085,I see... In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars - was bowling that popular in USA ?,Not really, back in the 60s football wasn't as popular and there was no unions, players during the offseason worked regular job
1086,ahh, ok... hey what's up with those pink locker rooms in university of iowa's ? Did You hear about that ?,Head games I guess. Did you know 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums belong to american college football teams?
1087,Probably huge budget stands behind it... That's why it's also so popular...,Yea, kinda a shame sports are more important than academics, The highest paid across all u.s. department of defense employees are three football coaches of the service branch teams.
1088,I agree, but it was always like that... entertainment above all - whatever brings more profit... Hey, it was really nice chatting with You !,You too, have a good one
1089,Hey! How's it going? Do you like football?,Yes i do... very much!  Do you?
1090,I do, what do you think about Baker Mayfield?,He seems pretty good so far!  Who's you're favorite team out the 32 teams in the NFL?
1091,I'm a New Orleans Saints fan myself, how about you?,That's cool... i like them... although payton's faces are pretty funny!  I am an Eagles fan.
1092,Yeah they are. I like the Eagles too, there's been a lot of good players come through there.,Yeah... be nice to have a consistent quarterback!  I can't believe Kellen Moore is the only left handed QB!
1093,I can't either. I find that odd. I guess the last quarterback I knew of in the league was Tim Tebow.,So i wonder when we will see a female player in the NFL?
1094,I'm not sure, I'm surprised there hasn't been one since there's no rule against it.,So true!  What position you think she will play?
1095,I'm not sure. I could see a defensive back or something.,i was thinking more like a kicker.
1096,That would work too. I would just hope they would get treated better than the cheerleaders. The Saint's cheerleaders are forbidden from eating at the same restaurant as any NFL player.,Crazy isn;t it?  You ever heard of that before being a saints fan?
1097,I had not, it's pretty horrible. Even if they are already dining at a restaurant and an NFL player comes in after, they have to leave. That is crazy to me!,Extremely unfair... they need to change that rule... it's very rude!
1098,I agree they do. The game has changed so much in the NFL. In the 60's top bowlers made twice as much as top NFL stars. Now I'm sure that's reversed tenfold.,Oh yeah... for sure!  How about we sit around for 3 hours watching a game for only 11 total minutes of live gameplay... we muct be crazy!
1099,Hello! How are you today?,Doing well thanks. How about you?
1100,I'm going great as well! Do you like football?,I follow it some. Do you think there will ever be a women playing in the NFL?
1101,Maybe as a kicker to start with! More and more girls are getting into it which is awesome! What do you think?,I think there will be, I'm all for it if they can do it. Did you know the average NFL game only has 11 minute of live action?
1102,That's great! I didn't know that, it's too funny though because we waste 3 hours watching it haha.,Yeah, and also think about how many hours of practice they go through for just 11 minutes.
1103,I agree! I bet the 1916 game that was 222-0 took more than 11 minutes of gameplay lol.,I'm sure. I can't believe they didn't stop that game.
1104,I would have just walked off the field lol. I wonder if they were in a trance because of a pink locker room like the Iowa Hawkeyes do?,Maybe. If I was on the team that had their locker room painted I would retaliate by shutting off the Hawkeyes hot water.
1105,Haha that would be a nice revenge measure! Would you rather have been a bowler or a football player in the 1960s?,In the 60's I would have rather been a football player. Today I have more sense. How about you?
1106,I would have been a bowler because they were paid much more than football players!,I can see your point. What do you think about the tracking chips the NFL uses?
1107,I think it is great because it records a players every move on the field. I wonder what they do with the footballs!,Well, Tom Brady could how many times the football rotated and then let some air out.
1108,Haha I'm sure he somehow "lost" the chips on that football haha.  I see his JV high school football team was terrible, but they never put him in!,Ha, right. I have to give Brady credit, no matter what else he has had quite a career.
1109,I don't keep up with individual players much, but the NFL gains a lot of attention when it's not in the 17 weeks of the regular season,Yeah it does, I know it still has the highest tv ratings of all of our major sports.
1110,I wonder how much more popular it would be if there were a female player. There's technically no rule against that happening,I think that would be so cool if a female player did make a pro team.  To young girls into sports it would be huge as well.
1111,can you believe each game is only really eleven minutes of live gameplay,Isn't that pretty crazy, doesn't seem like anything, but there are tons of stops in the game.
1112,Still, that seems so short. I wonder how they used to keep track of all the stats before they had chips embedded in the footballs and shoulder pads. Then again, people weren't as obsessed with fantasy football before all the technology,That is true and there wasn't nearly the amount of focus and attention to injuries as there are now.  Especially all of the stuff on concussions.
1113,Also true. It can be risky even now. I'm not sure if all the money is worth it if engineers can make more money over a lifetime,Yeah I think when you add it up those engineers make more because they work for a much longer time, but I could be wrong.
1114,That's probably also true. The work is likely more steady and requires less moving unless you're as good as Tom Brady and can stay with the same team over a long period of time,I wonder how many years Tom has left in him.  I would say he has won enough.
1115,Who knows? Maybe he likes being the leader of the offensive team,Speaking of football, do you know what the highest scoring game ever was?
1116,Wasn't it when Georgia Tech played against Cumberland?,Good call! Yeah it sounds like the defense didn't show up that at all, or the offense I guess.
1117,Maybe Georgia Tech had a good RB. Green-Ellis never fumbled the ball during his NFL career,That is some stat, to be a pro running back and never had a fumble, that is impressive.
1118,Very true. The visitor's lockers at the University of Iowa are painted pink. I wonder whose idea that was,That is pretty funny that whoever is in charge at that school gave the ok for them to paint it that way.
1119,Hey are you an NFL fan? I am and I like to speculate about next season. One hot topic is whether Dez Bryant is still elite. what do you think?,I'm not a big fan - don't know a lot about football. I know he is a player for the Cowboys.
1120,Oh thats too bad. Yeah football can be a tough game. An NFL game only has 11 minutes of actual gameplay isn't that odd?,Yeah that is odd. Also odd that New Orleans Saints cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as an NFL player. Very strange.
1121,Yeah I have heard that. I don't like that rule-apparently they are worried about the cheerleaders distracting the player. Football wasn't always popular though-in the 1960's pro bowlers made more money than football players!,Wow that's really surprising. I know they bring in the money now. Even though an engineer still earns more in a lifetime than an NFL or MLB player on average.
1122,Yeah thats a great point-because the NFL career is so short-too many injuries, no longevity. Did you know the NFL uses chips in the players shoulder pads to track their movements on the field-probably to make sure they don't kneel lol.,Haha yeah and they track the football itself too!
1123,Oh interesting. No wonder they have so many interesting statistics! Do you think there will ever be a woman nfl player? They are allowed to play you know.,Yeah I was kind of surprised to learn that. I'm sure it will come up at some point. I wonder if it hasn't happened yet because women aren't aware of this or because they fail to meet league eligibility requirements.
1124,Probably because they are smart and don't want to trash their brain and body lol. But I think there is a woman player who is becoming very close-she is one of the best players in recent years I saw on ESPN. I don't remember what position though.,Yeah it can definitely do some damage playing football.
1125,Definitely. But football players definitely know how to live large and have fun. The University of Iowas locker room painted their visiting teams locker room pink.,That's something I would like to see. I guess that is supposed to mess with the opposing team before the game haha
1126,Yeah I bet it works! One exciting thing to watch during an NFL game is when a player fumbles, but former patriots running back Green-Ellis never fumbled in his life! crazy.,That's pretty impressive. Also interesting that Kellan Moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl.
1127,Yeah totally agree. Interesting because in some sports like tennis it can be an advantage, but apparently not in the NFL.,Also pretty interesting that the circular huddle was created by hubbard, a deaf quarterback, so the other team couldn't read his hand signals. Pretty smart and the huddle has stuck with the sport.
1128,That is very interesting. I always wondered about that. It is funny how certain behaviors and acts just stick over time and no one questions where they originated.,Yes that is very true. Well it has been nice talking to you.
1129,You too. have a great day!,Goodbye.
1130,Hi. Did you know ESPN won an Emmy for that superimposed yellow line of theirs?,i did not know that! i guess espn discovered something that people needed all along.
1131,I don't see how it's needed, but I'm not a football fan. Maybe they should have used it in that game of Georgia Tech, where they defeate their opponent 222-0.,it help understand just how close the team is to a first down. sometimes its not clear. i figure that GT did not need to do that to poor cumberland.
1132,Ah. Okay. Thanks for explaining it. I thought it may have been something to do with being owned by Disney, and their Imagineers were bored, lol. I would love to see the U of IA's pink, visitor's lockerroom.,i would love to see it too. and talk to the person that decided to do that. does it have any effect? i wonder
1133,I would think they would enjoy the ambiance, lol. It's weird that there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay.,i guess there is a LOT of standing and waiting and the officials conferring and stuff. great pay for all that waiting LOL
1134,They sure do. What do you think of the use of tracking chips in the balls?,i think it is good to understand how the game works. i would like to improve player safety. i think the chips might help there.
1135,Same with the ones in the shoulder pads?,Yes, they could help understand situations when players get hurt. maybe understand how to minimize risk of injury.
1136,I'm shocked a woman hasn't been on a team yet, the NFL doesn't have any rules prohibiting it.,i would expect that some positions could be open to women,like kicker or punter. but there is pipeline of male talent.
1137,Sounds kind of sexist, same with the Saint's archaic rule against cheerleaders eating in the same restaurant as the players.,yes, it is sexist and misogynistic. the cheerleaders are adults. they can be with the players in a public space.
1138,It's disgusting to think that if they are in the middle of their meal, they must leave when one comes in. It's for that reason alone, I don't buy any Saints Merch when I am in NOLA.,i dont know why that rule was started. there must have been a problem like romantic relationships or something.
1139,One would think there would be more teams that hae that. Being from Cleveland, I'm grateful that Baker Mayfield didn't decide to become a pro gamer, for the tweets by the CPD alone.,i guess some people should become gamers because they dont have other sports to play. but he had a choice. that is an easy one to make in my mind.
1140,Supposedly, he's pretty good at Halo 3. That's a tough game, and pro gamers can rake in big bucks at tournaments.,i guess they can, but how long is the career? Football can lead to many things. Anyway, great chat!
1141,Hi, how are you?,Hello, im great, so do you follow the NFL or college football?
1142,I follow both. Do you follow either or both?,I follow both, have you seen Virginia Tech play lately?
1143,I did a little last year but not recently. I went to Illinois so I am a big 10 guy. Do love the SEC though... kind of have to.,I see, well it seems like the defense needs a complete make over, they have a terrible defense hopefully the team can get better this year.
1144,Wasnt' 2017 a really good year at VT?,I think they had a good campaign in 2017, I think there performance wasnt as good on 2018, so do you have a favorite NFL team?
1145,I am a bears fan.,I see, too bad they didnt make it to the Superbowl this year, when was the last time the bears made it?
1146,2006. It was payton manning's first superbowl. He was with the colts. Devin Hester had that opening kickoff for a TD and it was awesome! I got so drunk that game.,that sounds like it was a great game indeed lol, its amazing how tech advances and now we can tell different data like the velocity, the rotation of the ball among others with the use of a simple chip.
1147,I wish football had the tech tennis does. Did you watch any of the Australian open?,I dont Im not a big tennis fan, more a soccer or football fan myself
1148,Ok... the tennis tech is like the soccer tech when they try to figure out a goal. Cant football use that tech? It would be so much quicker,I agree although players have also chips and I think that is really advanced.
1149,Yeah but I feel like it's a waste if they are not using them to further the game. They use it for data and not game enhancement.,I can see your point, you know there is a high school football stadium that had a cost of 60 million dollars, what a waste of money!!
1150,I bet it's in texas! THere's like 10 of them there. Big oil money + football crazy= $60M stadiums!,Hopefully it didnt come out of drug money, we waste enormous amount of money on stadium we have 14 of the biggest stadiums on the world on a list of 25
1151,How are you doing? Do you like watching the NFL? Surprisingly there is only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay.,I'm great great, how are you? Yes I love watching football and that blows my mind to think since we sit and watch a game for hours!
1152,Yes half the time I feel like I'm watching commercials. I'm still waiting for the first woman to play in the NFL because there is no written rule against it.,That would be a great day for society! I wonder what position she would try out for, kicker?
1153,Yeah kicker if she was smaller but maybe wide receiver if she was a bigger. One thing is for certain, I wouldn't want to be a cheerleader for the New Orleans Saints because they can't eat at the same restaurant as the players.,Imagine getting a steak and then having to leave because somebody came in. That is crazy to me! I do like the NFL technology though!
1154,Yeah you bring up a good point they have a lot of technology at their disposal. They even have chips inside of the footballs to track velocity, rotation, ball speed, and location.,Players can have their every move tracked on the field as well! ESPN even won an emmy for that yellow line we see on the field haha.
1155,Oh wow! I wonder if they track the quarterbacks every movement? I also wonder if a left-handed has different movements then a right had a quarterback. Kellan Moore would know.,Isn't he the only left handed quarterback in the league right now? The only others ones I can think of are Brunell, Steve Young, and Michael Vick!
1156,Yeah are used to like watching Michael Vick. But I think he is the only current one now. Quarterbacks are so important. Baker Mayfield almost quit football to become a competitive video game player.,I'm sure he's happy he changed his mind. If he keeps it up, he'll be making much much more than he would have playing video games!
1157,Yes good point. Although not as much as an engineer!,I guess if they take all the players that only play one or two years into that average, I do believe engineers in fact make more in their lifetime!
1158,Yes that is very surprising, it must be because the NFL players career is so short. Top bowlers in the 1960s used to make more than top football players as well.,I think I would have loved being a bowler back then, but yet again, how much is more for payment back then?
1159,Yeah I'm not sure that's a good question! There is only one running back I have ever heard of that has never fumbled the football and that is been Benjarvus green-Ellis who played for the patriots.,That is a crazy stat because he played in the league for years! These days, it's common for a running back to fumble like every other game! I wonder how many fumbles were in the 222-0 game back in 1916 lol.
1160,Wow what a beating that was. Georgia Tech must've been really good or Cumberland must've been really bad. Well it was nice chatting with you today!,I think I would have just walked off the field at that point. It was nice chatting with you as well!
1161,Do you like to watch football?,I love watching football, how about you?
1162,It's not my favorite sport to watch, honestly.  I prefer to watch soccer, tennis, skiing, ice skating.  But that's just me.  What is your favorite football team?,I like the vikings and the university of iowa for college, you?
1163,Honestly, I'm not sure.  Maybe the Patriots because I'm from New England?  But honestly, they have won a lot and I like underdog teams.,I like underdog teams too. Did you ever hear about Iowa and their pink locker room for their opponents?
1164,I have.  I am not sure how I feel about that.  I think its stupid and sexist.  They should instead paint it some bright neon distracting color.,I think they use pink for psychology purposes, not sexism. It is a natural calming color and it is used to relax the other team
1165,Really? Hm.  Did you know the NFL has no written rule against female players?,I did not know that, I wonder why there hasn't been a women playing before, not even a kicker
1166,I think it is because they still have to meet the league's eligability requirements.  Speaking of sexism tho, New Orleans saints cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as any NFL player.  If they are eating in a restaurant and an NFL player enters, they are required to leave.  Crazy!,I heard that, that is sexism 101! I wonder why no one has taken them to court over that. Now is the time to end that
1167,Yes.  Imagine you are in the middle of eating your meal, and you have to leave because an NFL football player walked in?,Right, that is not cool at all. Let them enjoy their meals!
1168,Seriously.  Like I can imagine a rule against socializing with football players of the opposite team, but to have to leave the restaurant is absurd.,That is true things need to change. Did you hear about tracking chips in shoulder pads for players now?
1169,I have heard about that.  Makes sense.  Did they not have them before "Deflategate". Lol,Maybe they were created because of that lol! I bet they were created by engineers who make more money in their lifetime than most nfl players
1170,That is surprising, but then I guess NFL players have a short career time while engineers have a long career.,For sure, I should have dreamed to be an engineer as a kid! It was so nice chatting with you!
1171,But then, good for the engineers, because being one requires a lot of skill and knowledge.  And it's very important for keeping everyone in society safe.,For sure, have a great weekend and enjoy your day!
1172,I enjoy the NFL. How about yourself?,I do to, but don't really follow the NFL...but wish I could!
1173,Sometimes it's difficult with so many games. Did you know that there are no written rules against female players?,Really? That's cool. I wonder if there will ever be any female players in the NFL, like maybe a quarterback! Haha
1174,They still have to meet requirements and with the size of those men I kind of doubt it. While I am glad they do not have rules against female players, I am angered by the sexist way in which the Saints treat their players.,I agree! Being forbidden to eat in the same place as they do is ridiculous. They even have to leave if they were there 1st! Football can have some crazy rules even outside of the game.
1175,You got it but I meant to say players not cheerleaders even though they are team players in their own way. Yes I do not understand why they would have to stop eating and leave. That's ridiculous and I can't think of a single good reason for it. It seems humiliating.,Oh, gotcha. Yes it is definitely insane if you ask me. Very humiliating! I do like how the university of Iowa painter the locker room pink for visitors haha, crazy!
1176,That seems like some kind of psychological warfare. Did you know that in the NFL they use tracking chips on players and footballs to track their every move? I wonder why they don't use that to make calls instead of just relying on reviews?,Wow, didn't know that, but I agree! It would make sense! There was a Patriot's player who never fumbled the football in his NFL career...if they were tracking maybe that would change! I bet he was an excellent player though.
1177,That was Benjarvus Green-Ellis. I believe he was a RB.,Exactly! So do you have a favorite team or player in the NFL? I like the quartebacks,they are such an important part of the game.
1178,I like the Bears. Their new QB needs some work. How about yourself?,I gotta stay with my home team QB, Josh Rosen...I know, they are not the best but hey, I love them.
1179,They've certainly had their moments over the last few years. Are you familiar with Alex Smith?,They have had there moments! Is he the guy that got his bachelor's degree in 2 years? And became the 1st overall pick in the 2005 NFL draft?
1180,Yes he did. He entered college as a junior and was working on his Master's when drafted. He's a very smart man.,Wow, I do remember that. Very smart to get that education. Just like Baker Mayfield....he is an excellent video game player. He even considered quitting football to play video games!
1181,It would certainly be easier on his body. He could always do it later. Are you familiar with Kellan Moore?,Right! Those players get beat up some games. Isn't Kellan a QB?
1182,Do you like football?  i read that Tom Brady in highschool JV team was never allowed to play and now he is the super bowl champion,I love football. Glad the playoffs are here but sad the season is drawing to a close too
1183,I read that the circular huddle was created by Paul D. Hubbard who was deaf and he wanted to make sure his teammates could his hand signals,That is true. Who do you think will be representing the AFC and NFC in the Super Bowl this year.
1184,I thinkk maybe the saint and chiefs,Are you a fan of either  team?
1185,Yes I like the Saints.  what about you?  Did you know that the NFL has no writtn rule against female pllayers,I hope to see one at least as a kicker in the NFL soon. I like the Saints too
1186,An article I read says that the NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.,Yeah, they are too busy showing us ads to generate revenue.
1187,speaking of Saints.  The cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as any NFL player,Thats a bit hypocritical of the team and the NFL given their stance against violence against women, don't you think?
1188,Yes, I find it quite odd.  It also says that even if they are already eating at a restaurant and one of the football players come in the cheerleaders are required to leave,I would like to see the NFL season extended by giving another bye week, especially if games are being played overseas
1189,That would make sense.  I saw that an engineers lifetime earnings are higher than an average NFL player,I find that hard to believe given the enormity of some of the NFL contracts these days
1190,That is actually what I was thinking.  I saw that ESPN won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line that represents the first down line for American Football games,Yeah, maybe they will get another one for the projected field goal line they have nowadays for next years awards
1191,I saw that the highest score ever in a football game was when Georgia Tech defeated cumberland 222-0  They must have been a really bad team,I thought the colts were going to score that many during the Houston game yesterday...lol
1192,LOL..I feel bad for that team back in 1916.  It must have been a depressing game to play,Time to watch the football games!
1193,Good evening. Do you like football?,I do like football. Do you have a favorite quarterback?
1194,All time Joe Montana. Did you know The university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink,I didn't. That's an interesting tactic. I think it's pretty interesting that Ben Roethlisberger is the winningest quarterback in the Cleveland Browns stadium.
1195,That is an interesting fact. I also read that the cheerleaders from the Saints can not eat in the same restaurant the players are in,I've actually heard about such restrictions. Seems a little antiquated to me. Did you know that Russell Wilson is still under a MLB contract even though he hasn't played in a regular season game since 2011. He got traded to the Yankees this year.
1196,Wow. I wonder how that was possible?  I don't know much about baseball,Seems an odd thing to do. His contract must not be worth very much and maybe they hope he'll retire from football and start playing baseball again. Wilson is also only one of 2 african-american quarterbacks to have won a super bowl.
1197,Did you know that An average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay,That is amazing. I guess it makes sense. They apparently have chips in the players shoulder pads and the footballs to record movements and other statistics.
1198,I did read about that. Former partiots rb benjarvus green-ellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career.,I actually had no idea. Brad Johnson is the only quarterback in NFL history to throw a touchdown pass to himself. I'd like to see some video of that!
1199,That would be an amazing video.  The circular huddle used in todays american football was created by paul d. hubbard, a deaf quarterback, so the other team could not read his hand signals.,Clever. Kellan Moore is the only left handed quarterback in the NFL. I guess football doesn't attract left handers like baseball does.
1200,I did not know that. Did you know there is no written rules against female players,If I had to guess we'd probably see a female kicker first. Speaking of firsts, the first NFL game was played in 1932 inside Chicago Stadium.
1201,Did you know Tom Brady was a backup quarter back who was never played by his team and they never won a game,Well, I bet they wish that they had played him now. Matt Patricia is the only rocket scientist coaching in the NFL.
1202,Here's something crazy the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 222-0,Poor Cumberland. College football teams have some of the largest stadiums in the world. In fact 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums are college football teams.
1203,You would think it would be the professional stadiums.,You would, but they're note. High school football stadiums are also somewhat out of control. There is a high school football stadium in Texas that seats 18,000.
1204,Wow that's amazing. Well Texas is a big state.,It is and if there is anywhere that they love football it is certainly Texas. High school football is a really big deal in certain areas. Snoop Dogg wrote a fight song for his son's high school football team.
1205,Hi. Do you like football at all?,Hello there, I do like football, I usually follow pretty closely during the season.  How about you?
1206,Me too. Have you watched Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs?,I have, I was hoping that he would have gone to the super bowl this season.  How about you?
1207,I'm a New England Patriots fan so I'm glad that he didn't but he will go to the super bowl eventually with the numbers that he put in this season.,Yeah you sure are glad then, your team has been dominating the last decade or so I would say.  Speaking of QB's, do you know who the only left handed one in the league is?
1208,I believe its Keelan Moore but I'm not sure.,Good call! Yeah it's him, I am surprised there aren't more.  Did you know Baker Mayfield is an excellent video game player?
1209,Yes. I heard somewhere that he is a very good Halo 3 player and that he thought of quitting football to pursue full time competitive gaming.,Yeah that was it, Halo 3, have you ever played any of the Halo games, I used to play the first Halo back when I was at school.
1210,I loved Halo 3 and I use to play it all the time a few years ago.,I don't think I have ever played that one, 1 and 2 I did.  Speaking of QB's again, do you know which one invented the modern huddle?
1211,I believe if I'm not mistaken it was Paul D. Hubbard.,Good call again!  Yeah and he was a deaf quarterback as well, so that is even cooler!
1212,Wow I didn't know that he was deaf. That is amazing!!!,Do you know what the highest score of any football game ever was?
1213,I think it was something like 222-0 and it happen long time ago.,Yeah it was, way back in 1916, poor Cumberland lost to Georgia Tech, sounds like it was never even a game.
1214,Yeah!!! It appears that game was over very quick.,Yeah sure does, wonder how many Cumberland fans were left when the final whistle blew.
1215,Yeah!!! I bet not that many that's for sure.,And only the die hard Cumberland ones too lol.
1216,Yeah!! It was a very embarrassing performance by them that day.,Yeah and that's an understatement.  Anyways, its been fun talking, I hope you enjoy the rest of your night.
1217,Are you a fan of the NFL?,I am! My favorite team is the Dallas Cowboys. What about you?
1218,I am a Vikings fan, but not religiously. Good thing you aren't a saints fan, did you hear how they treat their cheerleaders?,I actually did! I couldn't be one and agree to leave a restaurant simply because an NFL player decided to eat there too. I think that's ridiculous!
1219,Right, very sexist, I hope other teams don't do it. I wonder what the reason is,I'm guessing, but probably to prevent dating the NFL players and socializing with them.
1220,Right and distracting them before big games. Did you know the nfl only has like 11 minutes of actual gameplay,That's crazy since a game typically takes 2 hours or so to actually complete. Football actually can refer to a number of different sports depending on what country/region you use the word "football".
1221,even 3 hours sometimes lol. I know football is soccer everywhere else besides the US lol,Actually, it can refer to rugby, Australian rules football, and Gaelic football as well as soccer. So many variations!
1222,wow, that is so many variations! Do you have a favorite quarterback?,My favorite QB used to be Troy Aikman until I met him and learned how much of an arrogant, rude, inconsiderate person he is. My husband loves Tom Brady. You?
1223,Yikes scary, I never knew that about Troy Aikman! That stinks! Tom Brady is so good!,Yeah, but I still love Emmitt Smith. He was humble and nice. Tom Brady is good! He has 6 Super Bowl rings to prove it!
1224,For sure, did you know in high school though, Tom Bradys JV team never won  a game and the coach refused to put him in!,HAHA! Well he is probably regretting that decision!
1225,I bet lol. Do you follow College football?,Not very much. My husband does though, so we watch UGA play a lot and he likes to watch Sony Michel with the Patriots.
1226,Nice, good team! I am an Iowa Hawkeye fan, did you hear about their  locker room?,Oh yes!!! I heard the visitor's locker room in painted pink!!! HAHA I think that's awesome!
1227,The NFL is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams, all the player are eager to lift the trophy.,Some just never seem to get close.  LOL
1228,The NFL has no written rule against female players, women would able to met the leagues eligibility requirement. The first evidence of women playing football is organized in 1926.,Yeah, there is Gaelic football which some women play too.
1229,The team won the most championship is Green Bay packers, with 13 wins the highest afterwards, Super Bowl with 9 wins.,I am surprised it isnt the Patriots.  They have won 6 alone with Tom Brady as the QB.
1230,Yeah. Pittsburgh steelers also won 6 wins. All the team and coach working hard to lift the trophy.,Did you hear about that one game in 1916, 222-0.  Crazy score.  Georgia Tech was definitely working hard there.
1231,I feel sad for Cumberland. It was the greatest in the history forever. People never forget this defeat.,I dont even understand how a score can get that high, there are usually only 11 minutes of active game play per game.
1232,Yeah. I also feel the same. NFL uses tracking chips in the player shoulder pads to record their movement in the field. This shows how aggressive to lift the trophy.,I think they also use the data to prevent player injury and to improve the pads themselves.  Which is cool
1233,They tracking the ball speed and how players react in the pressure situation.,I bet it changes things for Kellan Moore, hes the only southpaw in the NFL
1234,Yeah. Sports commonly called football in certain places include association football. It is also a team sports, many countries like this game.,Which is what the US likes to call Soccer.  It is also a great game.
1235,In modern American football, The Quarterback is considered as the leader of the offensive team. Quarterback can also spike.,There was once a deaf quarterback that actually created the modern day circular huddle.
1236,It is very interesting.,Yeah, he didnt want the opposing team stealing his hand signals.
1237,Such tactics are also the part of the game. He want to win the game for his team.,Alex Smith did as well, he stuck around after earning his degree and started work on a masters.
1238,The cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any NFL player and If the player comes cheerleaders are asked to take leave the restaurant.,I think that is horrible.  that is no way to treat people.
1239,They are focusing on their game. To avoid distraction.,What does eating at a restaurant have to do with the game?
1240,The NFL regular season starts from early September to late December. Each team playing 16 games with each other.,That seems like a long time.  Its been nice chatting, but I've got to get going.  Have a nice day
1241,Hello, Do you enjoy football?,Yes, I like it especially out at the live games where you can really get the feel from it.  I heard about Nathan Peterman who completed 5 out of 18 passes for  24 yards and two interceptions - a 0.0 passer rating - while getting sacked three times before getting benched.  Gee.
1242,Wow, I do too! I love going to the games!! That is quiet a performance!!,Well, a lot of other women know a lot more than me about it.  But, I do know that the sport commonly called football in certain places includes association football which is known as soccer in most countries.  In America, we love what is called Gridiron football.
1243,Yes, I know. Association football is soccer. It can get confusing if your not familiar with it!!,That's the truth.  There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played by indigenous peoples in many different parts of the world. We love our games!
1244,True, Did you know the Buffalo Bills are equal to the New England Patriots in Superbowl loses!!,I remember hearing that. Something else I recently learned about football is that the league consists of 32 teams which are divided equally between the NFC and the AFC.  I didn't catch on to that before.
1245,I had heard that too! Very interesting... How talented is Benjarvus Green-Ellis in his NFL career to have never fumbled the football?,Yes, he must have very sticky hands. lol. Another interesting football fact is that an average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.
1246,After going to so many games I believe it!! Lots of time to run to bathroom or get a treat!! lol,I was surprised, it just seems to take so long for the game to be over.  New technology might help though.  NFL now uses tracking chips embedded in the players' shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field.
1247,Yes, that's a great thing to have! Have you heard the author of the Games of Thrones calls the New England Patrots  the Lannisters of the NFL?,Yes, I've heard that too.  Did you know that Kellan Moore is the only left handed quarterback in the NFL at this time?
1248,I would think there would be more than one at this time!! Who knew?  Left handed people are special!!,Another interesting fact is that the circular huddle used in today's American football was created by Paul D. Hubbard, a deaf quarterback, so that the other team could not read his hand signals. Amazing.
1249,Very good idea, especially if your hard of hearing. Do you like avocado ice-cream? Tom Brady loves it!,It's actually very creamy and sweet if you make it correctly.  Go Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. I like him.  Did you hear that the highest score ever in a football game occured in 1916 when Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland 222 to 0?
1250,Really, I haven't tried it yet, but I like avocados so I think I would if there is enough sugar.  Hard to understand a score getting that high! It must have seemed forever for the losing team.,I know, right?  Did you also hear that Alex Smith took so many AP tests in high school that he entered the university as a junior?  He received his bachelor's degree in two years. That was quick!
1251,He must be a fast learner. Maybe he's got photographic memory! Yes, Go Tom Brady and the Patriots, they have a devoted group of fans!! Good chatt!,Thank you, I thought so too. Have a great night.
1252,Good thing that Jaguars decided against Cousins, he wants too much money. DO you watch football?,Yes i do!  Curt cousins is greed and selfish
1253,he used to play here for the Redskins. I think he is a good QB, but I'm surprised by how much salary he commands.,Well, there are not many QBs to choose from, so maybe that's why
1254,Yeah, i can see that. It didn't make a difference for Washington though. They haven't been very good since they were owned by San Snyder,Yeah that's for sure!  That's crazy that keelan moore is the only left handed QB in the NFL
1255,It sort of reminds me of pitchers as well. Lefty's are pretty rare to begin with, and easier to bat against if you are a right hander. But still only 1 left hander in the NFL seems really small.,yup!  How about tom brady never getting to play on his HS losing season?
1256,I didn't know that. He's a really good QB. He also is rarely injured. I think that is a big part of being successful.,definitely is!  I like Blake bortles, he actually lived in the town i live in
1257,He's pretty good. I live in the DC area, it is not uncommon to see the players out at some of the local sports bars. I've seen Cousins out multiple times.,OH that's cool! I would love to see a female kicker in the NFL
1258,It would be interesting. I'm sure there are probably a few qualified candidates.,i am sure too!  Can you believe only 11 minutes of actual playing time?
1259,Yeah, I can believe it. The plays happen pretty quickly. When I was in high school there was a girl on the football team.,oh yeah?  my high school had a girl on the team and a boy on the cheerleader team!  LOL
1260,George W. Bush was a male cheerleader for his college I think. I didn't know that engineer's make more than the average MLB player. NFL I can believe.,well, they need to do a better job at spreading out their salaries over time instead of living in access
1261,Yeah, I also think they don't save and invest their earnings properly over time and it hurts them in the long run. Clinton Portis now drives an uber here around in DC.,REally?  WOW... talk about poor money management!  Funny how a saints cheerleader has to leave a restaurant if a saints player comes in
1262,Yeah, they have all kinds of rules like that for Cheerleaders. One the players here in DC, Chris Cooley, got in trouble for marrying a cheerleader from the team.,Crazy!  Well i am out... been fun!  Take care!  Go Eeagles!!!! LOL
1263,Are you familiar with football and the nfl?,Love Football but don't get to watch it at all, hoping to see some of the SB this Sunday
1264,So you must know that the nfl is one of the four major professional sports league in North America,I did i also heard there no written rule that keeps women from playing.
1265,Indeed, I was especially surprised the average nfl game only has 11 min of live gameplay,That's crazy for how much revenue it generates. Now i hear there going to be using tracking chips in the players.
1266,Well I admit there sure is a lot of action in those short, yet long 11 minutes. I think the chips will help coaches gather data to make better plays and better understand football, especially since they are putting chips in the very footballs themselves.,I understand the football but what's the deal with the need to put them in shoulder pads.
1267,So they can see how players tend to move around the field, if there is gaps in the formation or how they can improve I guess.,Well ok! Something about tracking chips makes a little nervy. Did you know that the circular huddle was created for a deaf quaterback?
1268,I only recently found out myself. However, what stunned me the most was the the cheerleaders of the new orlean saints are forbidden from eating in the same restaurants as any nfl players. I wonder why?,I assume that's to deter them from fraternizing. Can't do that if your forced to leave the restaurant.
1269,Ya but I wonder if there was an incident for them to be so extreme about it. You don't see other teams having such rules,Probably was and they nipped it in the bud before the public got a hold to it. Seems being an Engineer is pretty lucrative, even more so than an nfl or mlb player over there lifetime.
1270,But I think you have to consider that most players probably work for far less years than engineers.,Yeah true that, still an honest profession. i wonder how much more they have to work to be consider having made more money?
1271,Hmmm a great question. In any case, give your interest in football, what position do you like? Personally, I am most interested in the quarterbacks,Apparently Kellan Moore is the only left handed quarterback in the NFL, that's strange.
1272,Quite a coincidence. I wonder if being left handed as a quarterback is advantageous or disadvantageous. This would really matter given that quarterbacks are the core of the team's offense.,Yeah your right. I just remember as a kid hating that the ball spun the wrong way, haha! Iowa's coach had the visitors locker room painted Pink.
1273,Hi, how are you over there? Are you feeling good?,Hi! Yes, pretty great Thank you! just finished watching some football videos. Are you a fan of Football?
1274,I do not usually watch the football. It is violence, and my household does not truck with violence on TV, only in person.,Haha! I agree it is a very aggressive sport. Which got me wondering why I hadn't seen any female football players did you know there are currently no written rules against female players in the NFL.
1275,I think that violence against women would be an queer spectator sport, even in America. Is there a sport with violence against the women?,Um, no I don't think so, but did you know an average nfl game is only 11 minutes of gameplay?
1276,Thats scandalous. Therre should be some sort of law about minimal work time or something.,Yes, It makes me ponder how much times have changed. Back in the 60's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars.
1277,How much money was that exactly? I dont think either of them groups made much. I guess the bowlers got all the women and the glory though. They were graceful ahtletes.,Im not sure, but yes there seems to be a lot of irregularities within the sport for instance New Orleans Saints cheerleaders are not allowed to be in the same restaurants as any of the players.
1278,I think thats a sexist form of misogyny or seomething along those lines. The men should be chivalrous and leave the women.,To each their own I suppose, speaking of lines, That super imposed yellow line you see in the game, ESPN has won an emmy for that. Did know that was possible.
1279,I think ESPN should try to put a line where the cheerleaders are so that they dont have problems with players. That would be chivalrous of ESPN. What does ESPN stand for?,I think people should just have some common sense but I don't see that happening anytime soon. The NFL uses tracking devices to track players on the field, im sure that a way to keep tabs on players
1280,I think they could track them off the field too. Too many of them guys get into all kinds of criminal mischief. They need some help.,in that case the whole world would be tracked, I think we can think of better ways than to "control"
1281,NFL players are role models for many young people. I am not. I cannot speak for you. I figure that if they don't get into trouble, they dont need tracking. But some of them,.. I dunno.,Thats a whole other subject we dont have enough time here for. but this would be a whole different place if more Love was implemented the current system has people going crazy and violence is out of hand, we must look within oneself.
1282,I suppose that we are running out of time. The NFL should invent a chip to help up look within ourselves not just track each other. What is inside? Chips might just help us there.,I disagree, we have everything we need to look within ourself... you would just be giving YOUR power away by allowing to get chipped. Someone else in control of you and your decision. This plante would no longer be free will. The NFL should just stick with tracking balls to track speed and rotation
1283,I feel lost sometimes and am willing to try the chips. I trust the science of the soul. Anyway, thanks for the heart to heart chat. Peace.,Meditate, I feel the same way! but have found answers looking within, you need nothing else, change your vibration and your outlook in life and life will reciprocate. Itll be challenging but its worth it. Then and only then you will be free. Nice chatting with you too! Namaste. In Love and Light.
1284,Hello!,Hi, how are you?
1285,Doing well, and yourself?,Very well, thanks. Do you enjoy football?
1286,I do! Did you watch the Super Bowl last night?,I did! Although I did fall asleep during the 4th quarter and woke up when trophy was being handed out... Did you watch?
1287,Lol! Can't say I blame you - it wasn't an overly exciting game,It wasn't... The glass of whiskey might have helped my sleep... Did you watch it?
1288,I did - I wasn't even a huge fan of the commercials which is normally my favorite part,I thought they were just ok too. Who were you rooting for?
1289,Anyone but the Patriots lol - so Rams last night. Normally I am more of a MN person,Uh oh... I am from Chicago so we have an NFC North friction. Just kidding, we are united by our hatred of Green Bay!
1290,Haha, yes! Mutual hatred always makes for entertainment! Did you have any favorite commercials?,I liked the NFL 100. It's' the only one that really stood out to me. Plus my kids were watching next to me and talked the entire time...
1291,Ah yeah that would definitely make it tough. Have you paid any attention to some of the NFL rule changes over the last couple of years?,Yeah. What do you have in mind...
1292,What are your thoughts on the new helmet rule when making contact?,My head understands it but my heart wants to see bone crushing hits. At the same time seeing the older NFL players struggle in daily life is tough...
1293,Yeah, I agree. It's kind of like going to a hockey game and they can only slap each other lol. Similar thoughts on the roughing the passer changes?,The QBs are protected pretty well so I would like to see some rules to help the def...
1294,That's an interesting thought - I've never thought about it from the other side. Do you have anything specific in mind?,Not really but there are times when the DEF is flagged for a simple hit that should not be flagged. Any way, thank you so much for the chat. I really enjoyed this one. I hope we get paired in the future...
1295,Are you a fan of football? I enjoy pro but not college so much.,me too, I like college football, but I don't like the idea of it. especially how they treat their players
1296,I also disagree with the treatment of their players. Speaking of college, did you know that the University of Iowa did to the visiting locker room?,I didn't hear, what did they do?
1297,They painted it completely pink!,what! no way. do you think it was to psych out their opponents?
1298,I would assume. So strange. Have you also ever heard what the highest football score ever was?,I did, it was an embarrassment, 222-0. wow. no mercy rule in football I guess, huh
1299,I can't imagine that. How is it even possible to score that many points in one game?!,idk haha meanwhile we have the supervowl score not even reaching a combined 30 points! the team with zero must have just rolled over at one point
1300,Seems to be the case. Did you know that ESPN created the yellow line that shows the first down? Can you imagine watching a game on TV without that line?,it is absolutely necessary to use. I used to think that line was on the field in real life too and they just moved it a lot. then I went to a game and didn't see it
1301,Ha ha, that's hilarious. Have you ever heard of the RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis?,the name rings a bell but I'm not sure what he did
1302,He played for the Patriots. In his entire time with the Patriots he never fumbled a ball!,wow, what a guy. he must have been a star. Did you hear about Baker Mayfield?
1303,I did not. What about him?,apparently early on in his career he considered quitting football to pursue a professional Halo 3 career. you don't hear that every day!
1304,Oh wow. I suppose if he is still good that he can do it as a second career later.,that's a big maybe, I don't think the Halo 3 scene is as popular anymore. I think he made the right choice for sure
1305,Hey! Guess how the circular huddle used in football came to be!,i never knew that is how it happened but that it's really neat that it is because of a deaf quarterback so the other players could not see his hand signals
1306,Yes! I wonder how its benefitted the game outside of that. I don't actually follow football much. I've just been reading about it lately.,I love football but there are a lot of things i did not know like there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl his name is Kellan Moore
1307,Yes! It's surprising that there's only one, given the numbers. I wonder why.,Not sure but thats cool.I also just learned that the former patriots running back has never fumbled a football in his nfl career
1308,Yes! Benjarvus Green-Ellis! But how much time did he spend playing? I wonder if he was really good or if he just didn't play much.,LOL i didnt think about that
1309,Yeah, with only 11 minutes of actual play per game, and not all of the players on the field at once, you could get through a season without being on the field for long.,true true! Did you know there were tracking devices in uniforms and in the actual football itself
1310,Yes, the NFL uses shoulder pads with embedded chips.,that's crazy i never would have guessed that and that the new orleans saints cheerleaders are not allowed to dine with the nfl players and if they are eating already the cheerleaders have to stop eating and leave. i wonder why
1311,Yeah, requiring them to leave sounds dubious. Does the NFL compensate them for the meal they miss? Why not just have some kind of communication to prevent that from happening? I mean since they have that rule to begin with.,I agree, you're exactly right, you'd think they would have thought of that instead of drama happening if they do show up at the same spot
1312,Yeah. Today, they could just have an app where players and cheerleaders check into a restaurant. They wouldn't have to communicate with each other, which is probably the point. It would be interesting to interview players and cheerleaders about what they think of that rule.,yeah it would  be the smart thing to do and there are apps for taking your dog out for a walk so you think they would have one for that
1313,Yeah. They could use an existing app, like Google Maps, for example. I can see potential issues with the having to leave thing, like if someone wasn't compensated for a meal they didn't get to eat or if there was some kind of health issue involved? It just seems like something that would lead to problems.,absolutely i wonder why they do that like if the team had some type of problems with the cheerleaders stalking or something
1314,Yeah. I guess the point is so that the players and cheerleaders don't get too friendly with each other - so the cheerleaders aren't a distraction from the players' significant others, so everyone stays professional during the game, to avoid harassment of the cheerleaders or vice versa, stuff like that.,you think that would be for all the teams not just one team out of how many
1315,Yeah. And people should be trusted to behave responsibly once they have such a prestigious job.,they should be trusted to act prestigiously regardless of there job but people are human and we all mess up some more then others unfortunately
1316,Yes. But with a job where you're in the public eye and there's fierce competition to get there, people should be expected to hold themselves to certain standards and if they do something out of line - like harassing a cheerleader - just let them go and let someone else take their place.,yes you're right about that
1317,Do you watch Football?,I do. I didn't realize that Kellan Moore is the only left handed quarterback in the NFL.
1318,I'm not a big follower, but that is very interesting! Why is the quarterback is usually considered the leader of the offensive team?,Because he calls the plays and usually touches the ball on every offensive play. There is a quarterback named Russell Wilson who actually has a major league baseball contract in addition to his NFL contract. I didn't know that was possible.
1319,He sounds like a go getter! Wow. I was reading about the circular huddle that is used in football. I had no idea it was created by a deaf football player named Paul Hubbard.,That is interesting, but makes sense, so other teams couldn't see his plays. The highest paid US Department of Defense employees are the football coaches of the service branch teams!
1320,That is so neat! Women can play in the NFL too. I had no idea!,Awesome! Brad Johnson once threw a touchdown pass to himself! That would have been interesting to watch!
1321,That would! I wonder how that worked? I always wondered how much time was actually played in football. Says the average is only 11 minutes live gameplay.,Wow. Not much at all. I wonder who will be in the Superbowl the first Sunday in February?
1322,Will you watch all 17 weeks to the end?,I don't watch consistently, just once in a while. I didn't know the first playoff game was in 1932.
1323,Isn't that crazy? So it this..New orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player and if they are already dining at a restaurant and an nfl player comes in after, the cheerleaders are required to leave.,That's ridiculous and so old fashioned! I didn't know the NFL uses tracking devices in players shoulder pads and in the footballs themselves to record everything that happens during a game.
1324,me either! Do you follow the Colts? DO you think they will do well this season?,I don't follow them. I wonder if they will be one of the six teams from their conference to get into the playoffs.
1325,From the article it seems they really want the Colts to get in the playoffs.,I didn't know there were two wild card teams from each division that get in, I though it was just one from each.
1326,This is funny though..Baker mayfield (quarterback, university of oklahoma) once considered quitting football to pursue full-time competitive gaming, and claims to be able to beat anyone at the university of oklahoma one-on-one in halo 3.,Quite a claim to fame. College football is huge. 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums belong to american college football teams!
1327,Very cool! Merry Christmas!,Same to you!
1328,Hello there, do you follow the NFL at all?,Yes.  Did you know they track players with tracking chips that are in their shoulder pads?
1329,I think I have heard about that before.  The game is getting more high tech each year I will say.,It's amazing that there aren't any women playing in the NFL even though they are allowed to join.
1330,I think it would be really cool if a female player did make it and we got to see them on tv.,Maybe it's not all that cut out to be.  Engineers on average earn more than NFL players.
1331,I think I have heard that before, I think it is mainly due to the careers not being as long as an engineers.,Yeah.  Career paths can change unexpectedly for people.  Baker Mayfield considered being a competitive gamer.
1332,Yeah Baker was really good at Halo 3 if i'm correct, did you ever play Halo?,No I have not.  Also, Alex Smith had his bachelors degree before he was picked in the NFL draft.  We are not confined to one trade or craft.
1333,Alex Smith was really bright, I think he could have gone into any different field he wanted.,Yeah, everything is possible.  I hope though that New orleans saints cheerleaders get better treatment.
1334,That rule about them being the restaurant and having to leave is so outdated.,It is amazing that NFL games usually have 11 minutes of actual live game play.  That fact somehow alluded me.
1335,That is just crazy, I don't think most people would ever guess it was that little.,Decades ago, it may have been a better option to be a bowler than a football player.
1336,Yeah I would have loved to have been a pro bowler back then, on par with what the footballs guys were making!,Times were probably so different back then!
1337,Oh yeah and it goes to show just how much the NFL has grown since then.,I hope the changes to come will be changes that promote more diversity and equal treatment.  Use of tracking chips are a good step towards increasing safety.
1338,Hey, Tom Brady is 41.  How about that?  Are you ready to play in the NFL.,Not at this point. I think I'll stick to engineering. Better career longevity. But good for Tom! He's in the SB again. Getting a bit repetitive.
1339,Wow.  Engineering.  Care to guess the highest ever scoring football game?  It was in 1916.,I would guess that some powerhouse school played a puny academic institution. I wonder what the spread on the game was, and if the bookies took any bets.
1340,I do not know what the betting was like.  Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0.  I would have been bored watching that.,I wonder whether Georgia Tech put in their second and third string. The person scheduling that game must have been sacked. I'm surprised a Cumberland player didn't get killed!
1341,1916 was a long time ago.  Today, there are 32 teams in the NFL and a game has only 11 minutes of live game play.  Thats a lot of commercials, timeouts and flag waving.,The game really is slow. It's punctuated with a lot of violent action, but it doesn't have the flow of basketball.
1342,Yes. I agree.  I know that the life time earnings of an engineer is greater than the lifetime earnings of a NFL player.  I assume the violence makes for shorter earnings potential.,I figure the concussions alone preclude a career as an engineer after the NFL. I am surprised that there is only one left-handed QB in the NFL. I guess I expected more, since each team has three QBs or so.
1343,Only one left handed QB.  That is a fascinating bit of trivia.  Another fascinating bit of trivia is .. no rule against female players.  Think how wild the game would be.,I think female players could certainly handle non-contact positions such as kicker or punter. I don't know whether they could take the serious contact of the line of scrimmage.
1344,Art and grace in running with a ball has a place.  Or something like that.  Tom Brady is playing the first Sunday in February.  the super bowl is on.  Who is the left handed QB?,Kellan Moore is the only leftie out there. Brad Johnson has an interesting claim to fame: he is a QB, but he threw a TD to himself. I didn't know that was legal, but I guess the passer and receiver can be the same player.
1345,That is an interesting thing. I guess as a kid we all threw the ball in the air on a high arc to step forward and catch it again. Guess what color the U of Iowa painted the visiting team locker room?,Either something really sinister or something feminine.
1346,In it entirely painted pink.  I wonder if it makes a difference.  It is funny how many different games are kind of not football but called foot ball around the world. Soccer, rugby and more.,I guess they could have painted it black, just like the Rolling Stones said. Might have put the opposition in a dire mood. Football is such a generic term. Could mean almost anything.
1347,I am sure kids have fun with a ball no mater what.  Australian rules foot ball must be different than rugby.  I have never seen Gaelic football, but I bet its a tough game.,Violence is the key. I think the presence of the ball is incidental. Just there as an excuse to pummel the other team. Texas seems to be obsessed with high school football.
1348,Do you like football?,Good evening, yes I do.  How about you?
1349,I'm a big fan!  Do you have a favorite team?  I'm an Eagles fan myself.,Yes, don't hate me, but my favorite team is the Patriots!
1350,That's ok.  I like them too.  In fact I'm a big Brady fan.  My one grandmother came from the Boston area there and I still have cousins there.  So I root for them.,Cool, I didn't realize how many people actually LOATHE the New England Patriots and the GOAT Tom Brady.
1351,I actually watched his Tom vs Time documentary and I love the work ethic he puts into the game.  Did you know that former Patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled the football in his NFL career?,Yeah, I had heard that stat and I couldn't begin to imagine the pressure he felt to remain perfect throughout his career.  WoW!
1352,I know right?  lol  I read that ESPN won an Emmy award for creating the superimposed yellow first down line.  Never knew they had an Emmy award for something like that.,Me either, good for them, though.  It's such a part of watching the game, it deserved that award!
1353,I agree.  I go back and watch old games on youtube from like the 70s and 80s when I was a kid and it's just crazy how the graphics have changed since then.,Big difference between then and now, for sure.  Did you watch the last Superbowl?
1354,I did and I was rooting for the Patriots. I was rooting for them too last year when they lost.,Glad to hear that.  lol I swear that game seemed it lasted three hours!
1355,lol it did.  Even towards the end.  I liked watching Belechik on the sidelines towards the end when they were figuring out what was going on with the gameclock.  He looked like he was giving the sideline judge an earfull. lol  Did you know that an average NFL game only has 11 minutes of actual live gameplay?,Oh man, I knew there was alot of wasted time, but didn't think it was all that much, though.  Kind of makes me mad, now. lol
1356,Short isn't it?,So true!  Wonder why a woman hasn't played in the NFL, yet?
1357,Good question.  Do you know who Kellan Moore is?  I'm not familiar with him but I see where it says he is the only left handed QB in the NFL.,Yeah, that must be an advantage of some kind?
1358,hey do you know anything about football?,No, not a thing.  I think it is neat the way football means american football, soccer or rugby, depending on where you are.
1359,ya I don't watch, but I do know that I like the Patriots and they have a rb who has never dropped the ball,A running back that has never dropped the ball?  So, this implies american NFL football.  It is a dull game to watch, with only 11 minutes of live game play per game.
1360,yup I agree, also weird there are no rules against female players, would you watch that?,I think like the gorgeous ladies of wrestling, it has been done.  But I would watch some of that.  Not sure a 17 week season would be fun.
1361,ya we would have to see, did you know engineers make more than nfl players over their lifetime?,I believe the word average is very important there.  Some players never make it big, while most engineers pull money.  I wonder why cheerleaders can not be in the same restaurant as a new Orleans saint?
1362,ya I don't like that, they shouldn't have to leave, that just sounds outdated, what bout you?,An out dated and wrong thing.  I be some engineers use chips in players pads to track and record players movement.  Those engineers get paid more than the player.
1363,those tracking chips scare me, I wouldn't want someone to know my every move, hopefully they just keep those on the field,On the field and the one in the ball.  To bad the balls from Tom Brandies deflate gate were not monitored for air pressure.  The ball measures velocity, rotation and location.
1364,do you have a favorite quarterback? and did you know Kellan Moore was left handed,I have no favorite.  I would think left handed would be an advantage.  Most players would expect the ball to be in a certain location. Kellan would be a little off that.  The offensive team leader that touches the ball the most.
1365,yup I think it gives an advantage being left handed, did you hear about the deaf quarterback who invented the circular huddle,Such a important innovation.  Now everyone does it.  Or maybe stadium is so loud no one can hear.   There was a QB who wanted to be a pro gambler.  Oklahoma player I think.
1366,good thing he chose football, Baker Mayfield was going to be a professional gamer and play Halo 3,There are many things bout the game that seem like video games.  Take the line for the first down.  we expect it.  ESPN won an Emmy for its creation.
1367,that was a great creation for sure, very useful, also I never knew Alex Smith was a genius he got his degree in only 2 years,Good for Alex.  I wonder if he picked a useful major like engineering.  In the 1960's pro bowlers made as much as top football stars.  I wonder if engineers make more than bowlers?
1368,Hey how often do you watch the NFL? I know I watch football from time to time on TV,I watch one in a while. I find the games boring sometimes. They only play an average of 11 minutes per game!
1369,Yep you're right about that! That probably explains why the Super Bowl was a little bit boring this year haha. Do you think that women should play in the NFL by the way?,I know there's no rule saying they can't, so I guess if they can meet the requirements, they should probably be allowed.
1370,Yeah I can see that. I think we could see a female player in our lifetime, it's the only fair thing, as long as they're good enough to play they should be allowed to play I think,Yeah, they might as well get a fair shot. Some of the rules of the NFL are still sexist. Like how some cheerleaders can't eat at a restaurant where players are eating
1371,Yeah I don't like that rule. I think it's really stupid and not appropriate in this day and age. I just don't get how that one has been sued yet about it LOL, have you heard about the tracking chips that they use too,Yeah, that's pretty cool. Some things like that are so high tech. Like the yellow first down line that ESPN won an Emmy for!
1372,That's really genius by the way. I'm glad they won an Emmy for that, it's definitely necessary for enjoying games on the TV I think. But yes the tracking chips can track players movements and speed, I think that's pretty useful,I agree! They are in the footballs and shoulder pads! Do you know what the score of the highest scoring football game ever was?
1373,I don't. What was it? I do know that back in the sixties the top Bowlers made more than the top football players of the time. Now that is totally reversed today. Haha!,That's amazing! The highest score was 222-0! But it was a college game.
1374,Wow that's crazy! What year did happen? I would have loved to see that game haha. Do you think that the losing team had their locker room painted pink perhaps lol. I guess the University of Iowa's football team did that to the opposing players,It was way back in 1916. That's pretty funny, actually. I wonder what the visiting teams thought of that.
1375,Yeah I wonder that too, what do you think about the Patriots by the way? Did you know that they have a player who's never fumbled the ball? His name is BenJarvus Green-Ellis,I am kind of sick of them being in the Super Bowl every year, it's boring! He must feel a lot of pressure never to get his first fumble!
1376,Yeah I agree. I would feel so stressed every time I played haha. what do you think about Alex Smith by the way? Man is so smart, he got his bachelor's degree in only 2 years and then went to play for the NFL,That's pretty cool. He was the first pick in the 2005 draft, too!
1377,Oh that's cool! I really like the story behind the circular Huddle, it was created by a deaf quarterback in order to block the other team from seeing his hand signs, that's really cool,That's brilliant, actually! There is only one left handed quarterback in the NFL.
1378,Hello do you like football?,I do!  I'm a big fan!
1379,Oh good,  yeah football is very entertaining.,Yes it is!  The University of Iowa painted their visitors locker room pink.  Wonder why they did that?
1380,I think its a mental tactic,  like to make them feel calm or something,That would make sense.  In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars of that era. I'm sure that's not like that any longer.
1381,Yeah I doubt it also,  bowling isnt what it used to be.  Football players get paid a ton lol,lol  The highest scoring football game ever was when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0 in 1916.  Talk about a blowout!
1382,Ouch,  thats embarassing!  Thats a huge loss!,No doubt!  ESPN won an emmy for creating the yellow superimposed first down line you see on tv while watching games.  I didn't even know they gave out emmy's for something like that.
1383,Honestly me either lol But good for them that digital line has been really helpful on screens and tvs.,Yes! lol Former Patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled the ball in his NFL career.  Impressive!
1384,Thats crazy,  how does someone not fumble for their whole career,  thats great. There is also only one left handed quarter back in the nfl weird huh,I'm not sure. lol  That is amazing that there is only 1 left handed QB.
1385,The huddle was invented by a deaf quarterback,What was his name?  I can't remember it.
1386,paul d hubbard,Nice!  The NFL has no written rule against female players.  Wonder if we will see one ever?
1387,maybe,  but there's too much injury in football,True.  The average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.  Relatively short compared to how long they stretch the games out.  It's been fun chatting!
1388,Do you think that tie games in the NFL are good, bad or are you indifferent?,Indifferent.  A lot of people think it is fine.
1389,I really don't like sudden death types of dealing with it. There should be a clear winner.,Why do you think so?  Some people think that a tie should not be seen as less satisfying.
1390,I was referring to a sudden death victory.  I wasn't clear - there should be more time on the clock.  A tie is OK with me.,I am not an expert.  However, I admire some NFL teams.
1391,I prefer college when it comes to American football.  The excitement in things like "going for it" is the same.,I prefer college footballs better - no money is involved in it.  Do you know that NFL has no rule against female players?
1392,Agree.  I did.  I wonder if the NCAA does.  It's probably more of a university-by-university rule.,Probably.  Do you know that average NFL game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay?  What do you think about it?
1393,I played football in HS and there's a lot of standing around so I believe it.  What I can't believe is that the U. of Iowa has a pink locker room for visitors.,I heard about it.  Why do they do that? Why pink?
1394,I heard there are colors that calm and subdue like pink.  Some jails are that color.  Causes for design... Huddle are circular since a QB named Hubbard was deaf.  It makes sense for me if one isn't deaf.,I read about it.  He did not want the other team to read his hand signals.
1395,Makes sense... What doesn't make sense is that Georgia Tech, my alma mater, ran up the score 222-0 against Cumberland.  Not too proud of that...,Are you serious? But Georgia Tech won though.  Shouldn't you be proud?
1396,Maybe if it were Alabama but to humiliate poor Cumberland isn't too cool.  Like not letting Saints cheerleaders dine around Saints players doesn't seem too cool.,You are funny.  Cumberland humiliated themselves.
1397,So your not one for chivalry -- it seems to be dying like masculinity. Things change... In the 60's, top bowlers made more than top football stars.,I read about it?  Now bowlers make pennies compared to football players.
1398,That makes sense.  Bowlers don't have to stare down a 330 lbs. guard. Nor do they have to constantly reach ESPN's yellow line.  Do you want to continue?,I'm good.  It was nice chatting with you.  Talk to you again next time.
1399,Hi do you follow the NFL?,Yea, the Giants are my favorite team but I keep up with all 32 teams
1400,Nice!  I'm a Steelers fan.  How about Odell being traded to the Browns?,He's an awesome player but becomes a liability due to his temperament, the Giants aren't gonna be doing too well even if they kept him I just wish they got better picks for him
1401,I agree.  That trade caught me off guard when I saw it last night.  Now on to some facts..lol  The University of Iowa painted their visitors locker room comlpetely pink.  No idea why!,Maybe Iowa thinks the pink locker room will cause the visiting team to play worse
1402,lol  Maybe.  In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars of that era.  Way different now I'm sure.,Yea I never even thought bowlers made much money, let alone more than football stars
1403,I know!  I think bowling was really popular back then along with horse racing, boxing, and baseball.  All 3 of those sports have changed in fan attraction over the decades.,Yea, sports are constantly evolving, like the invention of the circular huddle by Paul D Hubbard
1404,Was he the deaf QB who invented it so the other team couldn't read his hand signals?,Yea, I wonder if the only left handed QB Kellan Moore invented any special techniques
1405,You would think he would have something different in his delivery of the ball.,Yea, I wonder if Alex Smith has different mechanics considering he's really smart, he started college as a junior
1406,That's a great story of his!  Once in he completed and graduated with a bachelor's deegree in only 2 years!,Yea he's a smart dude but I'm not so sure about Baker Mayfield, he considered playing games professionally instead of playing football
1407,I know that sounds crazy.  How about former Patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis.  He never fumbled the ball in his nfl career.,That's pretty cool, I wonder if playing for Bill Belichick had any thing to do with Green-Ellis never fumbling
1408,Might have.  Do you know what the highest scoring football game ever was?  it was nice chatting by the way.,I know Georgia Tech scored 222 point back in 1916, I wonder if they cheated at all
1409,Hello, how are you?,Good, how about yourself ?
1410,Pretty good, do you know anything about football?,Yes, I do..
1411,So, I am trying to understand what's going on with article section 1. Whatever Galette has caused, he slowly ranked lower...,I heard Junior Galette from Washinton might be a free agent next year.
1412,Interesting,... agent for one of the players?,He going to see if a new team wants to sign him next year. He probably won't garner much interest, because he's very injury prone..
1413,True, since he injured his achilles.,Plus his sack numbers were down. He use to be good when he played for the New Orleans Saints, but I think his best days are behind him.
1414,Well, he seemed overwhelmed from the start.,His current team really cut his playing time, which according to him, limits his opportunity to sack the quarterback.
1415,And his fans are rooting for him to go back to the Redskins, however, that is not easy.,Junior Galette  has had a slew off trouble off the field. He was even accused of domestic violence.
1416,I think from there, he slowly went downhill.,Plus, there are a lot better young players on the Redskins, namely Ryan Anderson.
1417,That is true, but it is sad for Galette to see the reality of his consequences that were caused from his past.,Hopefully if he stays with the Redskins he can return to his former glory. He did rank third on the team in quarterback pressures.
1418,He needs to step up his game. Get more training and keep his head up.,There is a loyal fan base in Washington, I'm sure everyone wants to see him do better next season.
1419,I agree. Hopefully, he browses through this to keep his spirits up. This will remind him how much his fans believes in him.,I'll be rooting for him.
1420,What do you think about the Baltimore Ravens? They just drafted Lamar Jackson,I'm not a huge fan because I'm a Bengals fan lol. Same division. I'm surprised they got rid of Flacco.
1421,Yeah I'm surprised too. who is your favorite quarterback by the way? I always loved Tom Brady haha,My favorite is probably Patrick Mahomes.
1422,Yeah he's good too. I also like Baker Mayfield a lot, especially because he used to play Halo 3 which is one of my favorite games,Did you know Kellan Moore is the only left handed QB in the NFL?
1423,No I didn't know that, I wonder if it gives him an advantage though? I do know about Alex Smith, he's actually really smart and almost got his master's degree, he even got his bachelor's and only two years before he was drafted,Alex Smith is an awesome guy. Did you know Russell Wilson is still under an MLB contract?
1424,No I didn't know that, how do you think that works? Would they actually try to use him? I like football a lot more than MLB anyway,Not too sure how that works. I don't think they would actually use him.
1425,Well that's good. I wonder if the NFL would ever use a female player? Do you think that will happen in our lifetime,I saw they don't have a written rule against it. I bet we will see a female kicker before long.
1426,Yes I could see that. I just don't know that an NFL game only lasts 11 minutes of Live gameplay, you'd think that it would last longer because it can take up to two hours on TV,That is crazy it is only 11 minutes of gameplay.
1427,Well that is crazy. But also crazy is the average lifetime earnings of an NFL player, it's lower than the average earnings of a engineer. Now that is crazy haha,That is very crazy. I would have never guessed that.
1428,I would have not guessed that cheerleaders would have to leave a restaurant if an actual player from their team came in. Did you hear about the New Orleans Saints? And the cheerleaders for them?,That's interesting. I heard many teams have rules around players and cheerleaders.
1429,Rules seem unnecessary but I also don't play football haha, I wonder if there's a rule against painting a locker room pink for instance,LOL I wonder if that works?
1430,did you know there is a university team whose visiting locker room is painted pink?,Yes.  I did know that. It is Iowa.  I think that is great competition.
1431,Ya I would like to see some stats to see if that, on average, affects the players, I bet it does, also crazy that in the 60's bowlers made more money that football players back then,True.  It is value based on audience.  The NFL has the eyeballs now.  I do love that yellow line that ESPN added to football broadcasts.
1432,ya that's interesting, I also like that the huddle was invented by a deaf quarterback, I wonder how he would call an audible if he was deaf though?,He would call the audible by talking.  Only he would not hear it.  ESPN got an Emmy for that yellow line.
1433,ah that makes sense I guess, I don't like the nfl personally, it doesn't surprise me that there are only about 11 minutes of actual gameply in the average game, I think it is pretty boring,I agree.  I greatly prefer college ball with many more plays.  The global family of games called football all have some way to score involving kicking.  It is pretty minor in US football I think.
1434,Yes that is true, also surprising is that in the nfl there is no written rule against female football players, and that women could play if they met the league's requirements,Wouldn't you be embarrassed to be the coach of a JV team.  never win, never score, have Tom Brady as you back-up QB and never let him play?
1435,yeah that would be embarrassing, also its crazy that on average an engineer makes more in his lifetime than the average nfl player, I wonder if its because of the injuries they can get,It is just a short career.  The average running back lasts 4 years.  The QBs today make a lot though.  Imagine if Baker Mayfield had quit football to be a gamer.  He would not have been cashing the big checks that he does today.
1436,Ah interesting, that is true, I saw that Baker was the Halo 3 champion of his college, I was really good at halo 1 and 2 I won a lot of tournaments when I was younger, did you ever play games?,Never played Halo, but I went to Oklahoma University so I watched every college game he played.  Alex Smith took so many AP tests that he entered college as a junior.  My grandson is taking a lot which will save his parents money.
1437,ah that is good, I took 4 ap tests when I went to college and passed all of them, so I saved money, still have some student loans but it is more managable than it otherwise would be haha,Do you play NFL fantasy football.  You play 17 weeks from Sept to Dec even though each team only plays 16 games.
1438,no I don't play that, I have friends who do and they always lose money haha. I did see that there is political fantasy that you can play, on whether each side passes certain bills and such, that's probably more to my liking because I follow politics more than football,It is hard to be an optimist when one follows politics closely.  We are so polarized.  I would not mind giving political fantasy a try.
1439,Yes I agree, it is bad because it can make you depressed but unfortunately it interests me and has an actual affect on my life, so I pay attention to it, do you play fantasy football?,No.  But my grown son plays in 5 leagues and makes between $500 and $800 each year.
1440,Good morning!  Do you watch football?,Morning! I do! I try to watch it every week during the regular season. How about you?
1441,Same here!  Do you watch college football?,nah not really, thats a little bit too much for me to follow and the teams are always changing around
1442,Oh that's too bad. Those games can get really good! Speaking of, the highest scoring football game ever was a college game.  Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0 back in 1916.,holy cow! I wonder how that happened haha thats such a huge amount of points scored
1443,It really is!  I wish there was a video record of it to see just what happened.  I can only guess that Cumberland had no defense whatsoever.,I know Id like to watch that game and see what happened. Did you know Snoop Dogg wrote the fight song for his high school team? haha it must have been a good song
1444,I didn't know that!  That's pretty cool!,and apparently the highest paid people in the US defense dept are all football coaches from the service branch teams. That seems unnecessary to me
1445,You know, it does to me too.  In the defense dept the highest paid people should be the people defending the country.  Back in the '60s bowlers made twice as much as football players.,I wonder how much bowlers were paid? or how little a football player was paid. it is definitely the opposite today
1446,That's for sure.  Now football is so popular that like you said, coaches in the defense dept are high paid and tv stations can win emmys for making yellow lines.,well the yellow line ESPN made IS revolutionary and changed the televised game forever for the better
1447,True and I love it too. It makes the game much more exciting to know just how far a team has to go to get that first down.  It's just, an emmy?,eh I dunno! they give out some strange awards apparently haha
1448,I guess they do at that!  Oh hey, have you heard about the university of iowa's locker room for visiting teams?,yea I heard it was painted pink, must be some kind of psychological warfare!
1449,I think so too!  It's kind of funny in a way also.  I like that they are so blatantly obvious with their warfare.,I know right? Did you know Kellen Moore is the only left handed QB in the NFL?
1450,Hey there how often do you watch the NFL? You watched on TV or do you go to games,Both. i go to games occasionally. not as often as snoop dog, but i go
1451,Haha I agree with you. I do go to games but it's very rare. I mostly watched them on TV. Did you know that the average NFL game only lasts about 11 minutes if you are counting the live gameplay? That seems so short,whoa. i want a refund. but these days even a high school stadium cost 60 million bucks..so im not holding my breath
1452,Yep I wouldn't hold my breath I there haha. Do you know any engineers btw? apparently an engineer will make more, over his or her lifetime, then an NFL player. That's because NFL players get injured and definitely don't work their entire lives,Plus, there isn't risk of injury like there is in football. Perhaps the engineers can tweak those chips embedded in the players uniforms to measure brain injuries
1453,That's a good point! I wish that all those brain injuries weren't the case, but it is good that they use those tracking chips to measure things like speed and acceleration of the players. I just hope that they take those off after they leave so that they're not tracked in their normal lives,yeah...dont want the wife to know where ur going.
1454,Haha that's a good point. Did you hear about the New Orleans Saints cheerleaders though? Definitely a weird thing in my opinion, how they have to leave restaurants if players are there,i wonder if they got chips in them too. then they can be warned before entering the restaurant
1455,Haha I guess they should do that. Then they could be sure that the two are never in the same room. Who is your favorite quarterback by the way?,well I like the way Sam Donald recovered from his first pass...but Russell Wilson's so versatile he could play baseball
1456,Yep that's a good point. Do you Baker Mayfield by the way? He was a big-time gamer and almost went pro, but at the last minute he changed over to playing football,wow. almost as impressive as throwing a td pass to yourself
1457,That sounds incredible! Who did that! I want to watch a video of it. Also sounding incredible, is Alex Smith, he actually finished his bachelor's in two years and was going for his master's before he got drafted,Brad Johnson did it. Won a Super Bowl.
1458,Oh that's cool. Have you ever bowled or watch bowling on TV before? Apparently top Bowlers in the 60s made twice as much as top football players, there's a complete reversal,wow. alex smith should give it a try. he's smart enough to learn anything fast
1459,Yep I agree with you. I'm sure he was smart enough to use the circular huddle, by the way that was invented by a deaf quarterback!,interesting. smarter than a circular firing squad no doubt.  its not rocket science but there has only been one rocket scientist coaching in the nfl
1460,Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You !,Me too! so what do you think about the Eagles this season? are you a football fan?
1461,Football yes ;) I mean a game when players use their feet to kick the ball ;) football ;),What time are you a fan of? its kind of hard to pick with all the teams In the NFL
1462,NFL ? no, I thought You said football - I like Manchaster United :) Red devils !,Oh, I see, I like Barcelona, Im a Messi fan actually I  think he is a great player.
1463,He surely is :) I'm from Poland so I vote for Lewandowski ! :),He is also a great player! do you think Lewandowski will go to Real Madrid at some point? It would be a great team for him.
1464,He might - You know it's all about the money... he is kind of a primadonna but I guess he has a right to be one ;) he scores plenty of goals ;),Yeah he does, what other players from Poland do you like or see having a big future?
1465,Grzegorz Krychowiak seems like the most successful but on National team he played terrible...,I see, didnt really followed Poland on the last World Cup, so howcome you dont life American Football?
1466,It's a good think You didn't pay attention to Polish team this WorldCup... that was just embarrassing and shameful... they played terrible... I don't know, american football is just not as much appealing to me - do You like it ?,Well my favorite team didnt even make it lol, and yeah I do like it, did you know a team lost by 220 once.
1467,is that a lot ? what is like a regular score ?,yeah that is a lot! it would be like losing 20-0 in a soccer game, and regularily teams score up to 60 points and games are tight.
1468,what ? How the heck two teams like that could even meet on the field ? Totally different level...,Yeah, that or the other team was blind, apparently both teams were at college level.
1469,There had to be some kind of a bet behind the scenes :) a dare or something like that ;),Definetely, I would retire from football after a loss like that one lol, kind of like the Brazilean soccer team in the 2014 World Cup, just a total humiliation.
1470,Yeah, but that was Brazil... kids there re being born with soccer balls stuck to their feet... quite a humiliation :),I know and in their own turf.
1471,hey did you know the nfl actually allows for female players?,Well, they should. Everybody is equal.
1472,ya assuming that they met the requirements, I think that'd be interesting and I could see it happening for sure,Well, think about it, in high school, they opened football to both genders.
1473,ya, I don't personally watch sports but it is interesting, also it doesn't surprise me that on average an NFL game only has 11 minutes of actual game play, I personally think football is pretty boring,The only sport I watch and enjoy the most is basketball. I feel football and baseball are boring. After the 7th inning, I'm yawning.
1474,Well did you know that the new york saints cheerleaders aren't allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the saints players? i don't know why but that is true, the NFL is weird,Yes, I have heard about that. I wonder why. Sexual harassment?
1475,Ya that's a good point I don't know, I read that iowa painted their visiting team's locker room pink, I wonder if that is considered harrassment,Maybe, they need to put an end to it.
1476,were you aware that in the 60's professional bowlers made more than professional football players? thats the complete opposite of today,I bet it is the opposite of today, as well. I feel that football players do way more than bowlers.
1477,yes I think so, do you ever bowl? I used to as a kid but I don't like how your score depends on previous frames, you and your friend could both get 8 strikes but depending on the order you would have different scores,Well, I am not a bowler. I had a turkey in one sitting, but that was it. It depends whether you have spares or not, as well.
1478,ya one interesting thing about football though is that the huddle was created by a deaf quaterback, the circle of people blocked the other team from seeing his hand signs,Imagine how much money he is making.
1479,ya I wonder if he patented it, also that Kellan Moore is the only left handed quaterback that plays in the NFL, I wonder if that gives him an advantage or not,Well, I heard as a rumor, but others say that it is a fact. However, people who are left handed can get into small or large accidents.
1480,Hmmm ya I don't know, I know that they are supposed to be more artsy, also they are more likely to be gay, but that's all I've heard about left handed people myself,Really? Well, my cousins aren't gay so those are assumptions that you have.
1481,Good Evening.  Do you follow football?,Hey there I watch football sometimes. I never knew there were thirty two different teams though, do you watch it?
1482,I watch a bit, I couldnt name all 32 but I think I could get most of them.,Apparently the teams are split between two divisions, the NFC and the AFC, but I don't know which teams go in which division, do you?
1483,Not even close.  I just know they have playoffs and one team from each division plays for the super bowl.,Yeah and they also have no rule against female players, so I'm just wondering when you think a female player is going to start playing for the NFL? They could probably have a kicker or something right now
1484,Maybe, but did you hear about how the Saints treat their cheerleaders?  As a woman that isnt exactly welcoming.,I did hear about that. I can't even eat in the same restaurant as a player, and then if the player comes in even if they are already eating, the cheerleader would have to leave. I think that's very messed up
1485,It really is, I wonder what prompted that worst of sexist egotistical policy?,Yeah it seems very outdated. What is not updated though is the use of tracking chips in football players. Apparently they put chips in the players shoulder pads and they can tell how fast the players are running as well as their location
1486,Yeah, I think they have even used it to make pads and helmets safer to find out what their bodies do when hit.  Thats pretty cool.,Yeah I hope they can fix the brain damage that players are getting. Also it's shocking that the average football game only has about 11 minutes of gameplay, that seems so low especially when games seem to last hours when you watch them on TV
1487,Yeah, and there is 60 minutes of "clock" time.  There should be far more action!,I agree with you! Also I have an engineering degree and apparently an engineer will make more over their lifetime than the average NFL player. I guess that I have that going for me LOL
1488,Far less damage to the body too.  I have a music ed degree, I could work 7 lifetimes and still not make that.,LOL well at least you can make good music! and it's crazy that in a 60s Bowlers would make almost twice as much as football stars, so you never know that music education Majors could end up making more sometime in the future haha
1489,Maybe, but with the current state of things in education, Id be better off learning to play football.  lol,Haha that's true. Do you know what the highest scoring football game of all time was? Apparently it was between Georgia Tech and Cumberland and the score was 222-0 lol
1490,I couldnt believe it when I first heard that  I thought it had to be some fluke.  But it is true.,Yeah I would have given up when it was 100 to 0 LOL, do you like the Patriots player BenJarvus Green-Ellis?
1491,Yeah, when he was on the Patriots he never fumbled.  Pretty impressive.,Yeah I agree. I like the Patriots a lot. Do you have a favorite quarterback? Personally I like Tom Brady
1492,All time favorite goes to Dan Marino,I liked that he was in Ace Ventura haha. But there are other interesting quarterbacks like Kellen Moore. Apparently he was the only left-handed quarterback in the NFL, great talking to you by the way!
1493,Hey there do you like watching football? I don't really do that myself, I'm not a sports guy,I actually do. Did you know Snoop dog wrote a song for the high school team of his son?
1494,No I didn't know that. Have you heard what it sounds like? I do know that one team painted their opposing team's locker room pink. I wonder how that worked out for them haha,Yeah that must not have been very pleasant. Do you know who are the three most paid defense employees?
1495,I think they're all football coaches aren't they? That seems like a massive waste of money to me?,Yeah they are, not sure what to make of that really. Do you know where is one of the largest high school stadiums?
1496,No I don't can you tell me? Also have you heard of the highest scoring football game of all time? It was 222 to 0,The stadium is in Allen, Texas with 18000 seats and cost $60 million to build. Oh who played in that game?
1497,Yep it was Cumberland vs. Georgia Tech, and Georgia Tech won. They must have either been amazing or Cumberland was horrible I'm not sure which LOL,Wow that is a huge difference. Did you know the majority of largest football stadiums are in the US?
1498,No I didn't know that. That's really crazy. Did you know that the average NFL game only last for about 10 or 11 minutes in terms of Life gameplay? That seems solo but explains why I get really bored haha,Wow that is so short. Did you know nowadays they put tracking ships on the players?
1499,I didn't know that no? How does that work? I do know that the New Orleans Saints cheerleaders have a lot of rules they have to abide by though. For instance they can't be in the same restaurant as a player, and if the player enters the restaurant then they have to leave, that seems really stupid,Well the tracking chips are in there to track velocity and speed and rotation so that they can use those to make the game better. I find that rule so sexist
1500,Yep I agree with you. Do you know any Engineers? Apparently over their lifetime they'll make more than any MLB player or NFL player for that matter,I guess that makes sense because football players might make a lot but their career is short
1501,Yep that's true. They just have to be smart with their money I guess. Do you like any NFL quarterbacks? For instance Baker Mayfield or Alex Smith?,I like Alex Smith, heard he was super smart too as he finished college in 2 years
1502,Yep he is a genius. He was even working on his Ph.D before he joined the NFL. Baker Mayfield was almost a full-time video game player. He is really good at Halo 3,Yeah heard he also has said that he can beat anyone in that game at the U of Kansas
1503,high how are you,Good.  Is Tom Brady still with the Patriots?
1504,Yes he is for now.,When is the next NFL championship game?
1505,I think next month.,Do you have any guess which team is going to win?
1506,no I have no clue. You?,the Patriots?
1507,Maybe I would like them to but who knows.,I'm not that familiar with NFL teams. I know it consists of 32 teams.
1508,Yes. The NFL's 17-week regular season runs from early September to late December, with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week.,Are you going to watch the next Super Bowl?  It's usually held first Sunday of February.
1509,Yes I will be watching with my family.,Do you usually watch the games at home?  My friend celebrate the super bowl like it is christmas.
1510,yes i watch at home,Do you know that the american flags you see at stadiums weigh 1100 pounds?
1511,I had no clue hard to believe,They cost approximately $50,000 to make them.
1512,wow thats a lot of money,NFL owners can afford it.
1513,Oh Espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line for american football games.,I did not know that. Did they collaborate with the NFL?
1514,Yes they did,I have to run.  It was nice chatting with you.
1515,Lets talk about Quarterbacks, the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback originally.,I've heard that, Paul D. Hubbard, he did it so the other team could not read his hand signals. That's pretty innovative.
1516,I agree, there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl, Kellan moore,Oh wow, I didn't realize that. It seems that Tom Brady had a rough start in football, his JV team had a historically bad season in which they didn't win a game nor score a touchdown, yet they never gave him a chance to play because he was the backup quarterback.
1517,Baker mayfield could have went another path, he really enjoys gaming, such as halo 3,It's a good thing he stuck with football. He did pretty great for his rookie season with the Browns.
1518,Alex smith has his bachelor's degree and was able to achieve that in only 2 years,Oh wow, that's cool. He's done better than me. I went to school for 6 years for an Associates. Haha.
1519,Lets talk about the NFL next, women could play in the NFL, there is no written rule against it,I didn't know that, I'm surprised there hasn't been a woman to play. I think it would be great.
1520,There are so many commercials, the average game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay,That's pretty wild. They take like 3 hours. I guess that's how they make their money.
1521,There are tracking chips in player's shoulder pads that the NFL uses to track movement on the field.,That's neat. Do they use it to track velocity, rotation, ball speed and location?
1522,yes, engineers can make more in a lifetime then NFL players,That's crazy to think, but I guess an engineer's career is a lot longer than an NFL player.
1523,yes, lets talk about football next, bowlers in the 1960's made twice that of NFL players,Oh wow. Did you know that the high score ever in a football game was 222-0?
1524,interesting, the creation of the yellow first down line won ESPN an emmy,That's a prestigious award. I've heard that University of Iowa's visiting locker room is completely painted pink. That has to fire up the opposing team.
1525,Hi, do you like football?,no it seems to go on forever
1526,But it only has 11 minutes of playing time...,yes and the season only goes on for 17 weeks but then they drag it on with all those ther competitions
1527,The good news is that they now have a new league, the AAF. That starts after the NFL. You have to be even more excited now,woo hoo, do you like football?
1528,I can feel the sarcasm.... I do. I also understand why people do not watch it. There is so much more to do on a sunday than watch football.,back in the 1960s bowlers earned more than footballers how times change
1529,Engineers now make more than the avg football players. Seems like a poor decision to risk permanent brain damage.,One player even considered competitive video games instead i wonder if they would make more?
1530,It wouldn't hurt as bad. Plus Mayfield was a great Halo player, supposedly...,why is there only one left handed quarter back?
1531,Left handers throw a ball that rotates opposite of right handers and fade in the opposite direction. It is difficult to change and get comfortable with them.,I never knew that
1532,I am full of useless sports knowledge.,did you know already that Iowas painted the locker room pink?
1533,That's a weird choice of color. I wonder if it actually works?,what is it indended to do?
1534,Make the visiting team play softer. I do not think that would work on me.,Maybe they should of tried with georgia tech in 1916
1535,Football fan?,I like to watch it, but I am not a fan.  Did you know that Espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed?
1536,Yeah, that's pretty cool. I wonder how that would have affected the highest scoring football game of all time. 222-0.,I heard about it. Think that was in  1976, but I am not sure what happened.
1537,1916 I think. Georgia Tech won.,Now I remember.  in 1960 it  was when top bowlers made twice  as top football stars
1538,Ah the halcyon days when bowling was lucrative!,I know.  do you know something about the football codes?
1539,I know they're thinking of changing how they apply the "roughing the passer" penalty.,Ok. there are certain interesting thing about football like the fact that a university locker room is painted pink.  Don't know why.
1540,I think to intimidate them. Pink being "girly". That's dumb. Who cares?  The NFL could have female players. There's no rule against it.,could be.
1541,The NFL has tracking chips in the shoulder pads of players to track their movements on the field. Kind of interesting.,That's pretty interesting. I guess they want to  track velocity and rotation and some other things.
1542,Yeah, interesting that they would get that deep into the weeds on it. I wonder if they do that in the other football games around the world, soccer, Aussie Rules etc.?,how can they forbidden from eating in the same restaurant?
1543,Cheerleaders?,new orleans saints cheerleaders
1544,I don't know. That seems dumb. Trying to dissuade fraternization or just really sexist?,I don´t know why but it is too much. they are required to leave the restaurant if an nfl player comes in after
1545,Hello.,Hey, are you into football?
1546,Oh yea, you?,Yes. Did you hear Chase Routllier is starting center with the Redskins?
1547,No, I didn't.  The Washington Redskins selected the Wyoming product with a sixth-round pick in the 2017 draft,Nice. I enjoy watching Chase Roullier. He takes very good angles, and good technique. He's a rookie, but he seems to be excelling in his position on the team.
1548,Yes, and he's just going to continue to get better,Yeah, he has to get comfortable with the offense with him being a center. Did you also hear Chris Thompson, runner back, is almost back to full health?
1549,That's great to hear. The nfl has no written rule against female players; women would in fact be allowed if they met the league's eligibility requirements.,I definitely agree with that statement. I know a lot of teams do not treat the cheerleaders of the football teams equally. The New Orleans Saint's Cheerleaders are not even allowed to eat in the same restaurant as their football players. So I bet the female players wouldn't get treated fairly.
1550,Wow, I can't stand the Saints anyways.  Nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field. they are also located inside footballs to track: velocity, rotation, ball speed and location.,I believe that the NFL shouldn't allow technology like that, because it could make coach's nit pick player's every moves. They need to let the players play naturally. Thank you for talking with me today about football.
1551,Yes, I enjoyed it as well.,Did you hear about the new helmet rule in the NFL?
1552,No, what's that rule.,Players cannot lower their heads and make contact with opponents. I seen it on an Eagles game I was watching.
1553,Oh yes, that is correct.  I have heard about that one.  The highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 222-0,I think the rule is hard for players when they are used to tackling in that manner. Wow that score is so high!
1554,Yes, they are.  They continue to change rules.,Did you know ESPN won an Emmy for the creation of the yellow line representing the first down line for American football games?
1555,No, I didn't.  Very interesting.  Thanks.  Can you hit done,Yes, thank you!
1556,Hello there, do you know who Tommy McDonald was?,He was a terrific football player who helped my team the Eagles to the NFL championship in '60.
1557,Yeah that is right, good call!  Well you certainly had a wild season last year!,Close on this year too!  I wish McDonald would have been around to help, but he unfortunately died at the age of 84.  He was a Hall of Famer.
1558,Yeah I was sad to hear about him passing.  I was glad he made it into the hall though.,He started out as a two-time All American in Oklahoma and played 12 seasons for the NFL making the Pro Bowl 6 times.  He was quite a player for his small figure at 5 foot 7 inches.
1559,Yeah that is so cool, I love it when those tiny guys make it big.  I was a big fan of muggsy bouges and earl boykins in the NBA.  Are you a big football fan in general?,Not particularly, but I like the Super Bowls.  If women started playing, that would be fun to watch.  The NFL has no rule against it.  I would cheer them on.
1560,Yeah I think that is so cool and I definitely hope to see a women playing in the NFL sometime soon!,I do like bowling though.  Are you a bowler?  In the 60's they made two times more than football players.
1561,Yeah I like to bowl and really!?  That is so crazy to think about, I would like to see a graph that shows how they overlapped as time when by.,Perhaps if Rb Benjarvus Green-Ellis were around then, the football players may have made more money with his impressive no fumbles in his NFL career.
1562,Wow, I didn't know that, super impressive.  I wonder how many total carries he had during his career.,I'm not sure but with only 11 minutes of live gameplay in the average game it still is impressive.
1563,Yeah I think I have read that before, you mean like not counting all the breaks right?  That seems like so little!,The balls and players are constantly tracked though.  All this technology adds to the game an extra tactic not used back in Tommy McDonalds time.  I bet no tracking chips were used then.
1564,Yeah I don't think they had that kind of technology then.  I know they use trackers in helmets for safety intelligence.,Do you listen to games on the radio?  If you do, you can also hear Jupiter's radio storms on the am stations.
1565,I do when I have to, I really like the local radio station we have here, they play lots of oldies.   Wow, that is a crazy fact!  Jupiter is so far away!,Sure is and it sounds like soldiers who also were probably far away from home made radios out of just a razorblade and pencil diode.  That was very inventive.
1566,hello, do you like football?,Hello there, I do like football, did you watch the Super Bowl recently?
1567,I did actually. What I did not know was that there were only 11 minutes of game play,Yeah thats about the average actual gameplay during a regular game.  There are lots of stops and reviews and all.
1568,yeah and all the ads. Did you know women can play?,Yeah I think that would be so cool if a female player made a pro roster in the near future.
1569,Yeah I hope that we see that at some point in the future, would make the game more fun,It would, and it would give young girls something to motivate them to achieve all sorts of goals.
1570,That is very true. Did you hear about that rule that applies to New Orleans cheerleaders?,Yeah I read about that, it seems a bit silly and outdated if you ask me.
1571,I think it is really messed up and not sure how it is still around,Yeah I agree, did you know about the average lifetime earnings?
1572,Yeah they make less then engineers, but then again their career is shorter,That is what I figure it is, that the average career of a pro sports player is so much shorter.
1573,Yeah. Did you know now they are using chips to track the players in the field?,Yeah I read about that, I think it helps them develop better safety features as well.
1574,Yes that makes sense. How about the radio, do you listen to it?,Yeah I do, I found a good local station that I really like.  How about yourself?
1575,Yes me too. If you listen on the am, you might catch Jupiter's storms,Yeah isn't that so cool!  Very interesting.
1576,hi, do you watch football?,I watched parts of the last superbowl. I have a passing knowledge and passing interest in football so I am on and off
1577,Nice. did you know university of iowa has oainted the visitor locker room pink,Do you know why?
1578,I have no idea, maybe discourage them in some way,Indeed, perhaps it is a mental thing to catch them off guard. So are you familiar with the nfl?
1579,yeah with some of it. i know football players used to make less than bowlers back in the day,I couldn't believe that the average nfl game is only 11 minutes
1580,I know yet we are glue to the tv for hours on end,I admit a lot and I mean a lot of action goes on in those few minutes. I mean the nfl is even putting chips in the ball and shoulder pads to get better data
1581,yeah that must come  in handy. espn won an award , an emmy,I admit their yellow line which they got an emmy for definitely made the game much more digestible for the audience
1582,seems that way. do you know what the highest score in history is?,I'm not sure but it must have been at least a difference of 150
1583,it was 222-0, georgia tech beat the cumberlands,I wonder if georgia tech was just that good, cumberlands was that bad, or perhaps a bit of both
1584,I think it was a combination of both,That does sound most plausible. Georgia tech must have had talents like tom brady or green ellis
1585,Not sure who played in their team but must have been boring to watch too,True. Perhaps surprising until 50 pts, entertaining until 100 pts, and dull until 222 points
1586,Hello - how are you doing today?,I am good. Just missing football season. I can't wait for the 32 teams to get back out on the field in the fall!
1587,I love football too. Who is your team?,I am from florida so I root for the dolphins even though they are terrible! The dolphins lose most of their 16 games a season.How about you?
1588,Haha I'm from Ohio so I root for the Cincinnati Bengals.,Hard to believe NFL football has been played since 1932. The field was 80 yards back then.
1589,That's crazy. There's no written rule against female players in the NFL.,I would like to see some female players. I bet they would be very strategic.
1590,It would be interesting. An average NFL game is only 11 minutes of live gameplay.,Have you ever seen snoop dogg's son play? he's pretty good! Snoop wrote a song for the high school team his son was on.
1591,I heard he's really good, but have never seen him play.,I enjoy listening to games on the radio. The use of air waves and electromagnetic energy waves is a great way to consume football.
1592,I love listening games on the radio as well. The average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than an average NFL and MLB player.,Engineers are the creators of the tracking chips the NFL uses to measure player moves on the field.
1593,That's a cool technology. Maybe it can help out with concussions and other injuries through data.,That would be amazing! A brilliant engineer that now coaches in the NFL is named Matt Patricia.
1594,That's cool. The highest ever football score was 222-0.,Humiliating score for the losing team! They probably did not make it to the super bowl on the first Sunday in February.
1595,Former Patriots Green-Ellis has never fumbled the football in his NFL career,That is impressive! He deserves a nice stadium like the Allen, Texas one that cost 60 million.
1596,Hi, how are you doing tonight?,Great.  Are you in one of the 32 NFL cities?
1597,At the moment, no. But I grew up near some. How about you?,I am in Phoenix, one of the 16 NFC cities.  Unfortunately, we have the number one draft choice which means the worst record.
1598,Well, it's a rebuilding year. Happens to many teams. Who do you think you'll get?,I would hope Kyler Murray but the defensive guy from Ohio State is most likely.  The season is 17 weeks even though each team only plays 16 games.
1599,Does anyone care about the sexual preferences of the players in the NFL these days?,I have heard a little rumbling, but I thought it was about gender rather than homosexuality.  What have you heard?
1600,Haven't heard. I know that there is no rule against women. What's the story?,I think that some teams just worry about PR challenges.  It takes a team chemistry to win.  I expect to see a woman kicker someday.  No rule against women in the NFL.
1601,Yeah, a woman kicker makes sense. Could come over from soccer.,Great point.  Imagine the income that players get from only 11 minutes of action in each game.  If you play defense or offense, that is 5.5 minutes for you.
1602,That's a pretty good per-minute salary. It's quite different from basketball and soccer.,True.  I started my career as an engineer and made about $4 million so far.  My neighbor was a running back for the Cardinals and he made $7 million in his last season.  But on average, engineers make more than NFL players over a career.
1603,Maybe your neighbor could become an engineer later in life after he retires from football. The earnings of an engineer are good. Women should go into that instead of football.,There is a push for women in STEM.  He coaches running backs for another NFL team now, so he is doing okay.  Brand new Porche in his driveway this week.  In New Orleans, the cheerleaders cannot dine in the same restaurant as a player.  The cheerleader has to leave if a player comes in.
1604,I think that's an outdated sexist system. Parents, don't let your daughters grow up to be cheerleaders! Teach 'em engineering!,Those NFL salaries took a while to grow.  In the 1960's, top bowlers earned more than NFL players.
1605,Top bowlers were lucky that the professional leagues didn't have their act together. College ball was big, and TV hadn't grown enough.,You are right.  Also, the NFL has to pay a lot more players than the 10 or 12 top bowlers.  That ESPN yellow line that marks the line to gain for a first down has been a nice improvement for TV watchers.
1606,It has been an improvement, but does it deserve an award?,Nice chat!
1607,Hey! Do you like football at all....,Love it and sad it is over for the year. It seems like the season goes so fast. You know the season is only 17 weeks with one bye week. Not enough football for me.
1608,Right! I love Football but rarely get to follow it. I sometimes listen to the games on the radio lol...always busy....,Did you know that Jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an am radio.  I wonder what that sounds like!
1609,Really? I really need to try and tune in so I can hear that, an A.M radio station huh? I will check it out! There is a website that plays old classic radio dramas for free.,I love some talk radio so that channel may be fun to listen to! In Canada the music on their radios have to be at least 40% must be canadian.
1610,Wow, I bet so the canadians can get good radio air time. I get that. I was listening to a talk radio show and they were saying an NFL game on average only has a mere 11 minutes of actual live play....that's crazy!,I know...you think that football players get paid the big bucks but I heard in the long run you are better off being an engineer.  They tend to have higher than average lifetime earnings of both a NFL and MLB player!
1611,No way! I never would have thought that at all....very interesting. I like the fact that the NFL has no written rules against women playing football, as long as they meet their requirements.,Better than being a cheerleader...the New Orleans Saints cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player and they even have to leave if one comes in to eat. Talk about double standards!
1612,That is just wrong, I wonder if that is true to this day or something of the past....just like the locker room being painted all pink in the University of Iowa's locker room for the visiting team lol,That is sure to annoy the visiting team! Did you know that in the 60s top bowlers made more money than football stars. Crazy!  Doesn't sound right!
1613,That is truly crazy! I bet that is not the case in present times lol. I wonder if they still use the tracking chips put into players pads to record their every move....and inside footballs to track velocity and rotation, speed very interesting!,Thank goodness no one is tracking how slow I am! You know the game football means different sports to different people. Like soccer in some countries is called football in others. So confusing!
1614,Haha, me too! That is interesting and makes sense! I wonder if they tracked the game that was won 222-0 back in 1916....that is awesome, what a score!,Wow! I feel sorry for the team that lost. Wasn't it Cumberland?
1615,Yes! It was actually. They played against Georgia tech. Pretty amazing, just like how former Patriots rb never fumbled a ball ever, in his NFL career!,Patriots are an amazing team...love or hate them they have the talent. Did you watch the Super Bowl this year? It is usually held the first sunday of february.
1616,I didn't get to see the Superbowl this year, but I heard it was an awesome game. The Patriots are definitely a great team. Would have loved to have seen the game!,Me too!  Well maybe next year with the season starts in September you can make it to a game.
1617,Right? I will definitely make it to a football game this year.,I hope so!  It was nice talking to you. Have a good day!
1618,DO you like football?,Yes I do. U of Iowa painted the visitor locker room pink
1619,I wonder if that is supposed to have some effect on the players,I wonder too. Bowlers make more money than them though in the 60s
1620,I guess football was not that popular back in the day either though,True. Do you know what the highest score in college football is?
1621,Yes that is Georgia Tech beating CUmberland 222-0,Yeah and that was way back in 1916 and is still a record
1622,Yeah. Did you know ESPN won an Emmy once?,Yes that was for the superimposed yellow line
1623,Yeah. Did you know Banjarvus Green-ELlis never fumbled the ball?,Wow, what a guy. Do you listen to the radio?
1624,Yes I do. You can listen to Jupiter's storms in am radio,Nice. Do you ever listen to Canadian radios?
1625,Yes sometimes but they play a lot of music from canadian artists,Yes they are required to do that by law, 40% of it has to be canadian
1626,True. Do you now how soldiers made foxhole radios during WWII?,Yes they used pencils and razorblades to make those
1627,Yes. Do you listen to radio dramas?,Yes there is a free website where you can listen to them too
1628,Hello, do you watch a lot of football?,I do sometimes. How about you?
1629,Actually, I don't. Only for big games like the Super Bowl etc. Did you know the average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay??,I know isn't that crazy as long as a game lasts. Did you know in the 60's bowlers made twice as much as the top football players.
1630,Now that is pretty awesome. I like bowling. Think it takes as much skill as football. I didn't realize girls could play in the NFL if they met the eligibility requirements.,I think guys would give them a hard time but it's cool. And if they are on the University of Iowa visiting team they get a pink locker room
1631,That would be great. Can't say I like the rules about the MO Saints' cheerleaders. Apparently they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as any NFL player already in the restaurant. Plus if a player comes in after, the cheerleaders have to leave. Unbelievable!,I think that is crazy. If they are at away game what are the chances of them running into a player at a restaurant. I wonder if they enforce it.
1632,I wonder why it is a rule. Something must have happened to cause them to come up with that one!,That is true. And I think it is interesting that NFL uses tracking chips in their players shoulder pads
1633,All in all, I think football is pretty scientific with all the plays and strategies they come up with. Those chips track all their moves and helps the coaches design their moves. Pretty genius.,True. Can you believe there was a game of a score of 222-0. How is that even possible.
1634,Either GA Tech was really good or Cumberland was really bad. How about Patriots' running back Benjarvus who never fumbled the ball in his entire career?,That is a great accomplishment. Did you know ESPN won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line.
1635,That is pretty cool. I need all the TV explanations that go on during the games. Otherwise I would be so lost sometimes. ESPN is the channel we watch for all sports.,I like ESPN for some things. I got ESPN 2 for UFC events and it has not been a good experience.
1636,That's too bad. Did you hear that the Cardinals' Adrian Peterson is buying his linemen mattresses because they did so well in the last game. I guess they were pretty horrible before. He wants to make sure they sleep well. :),That is nice of him to do. NFL players make a lot of money but it's interesting that Engineers make more money than NFL players
1637,They use a lot of brain power! BTW, I meant to say the Redskins not Cardinals. :),Do you like to listen to the radio?
1638,Hello, do you watch the NFL?,Hello!  Yes big fan here!  How about you?
1639,I love the NFL as well. Did you know they have no written rule against females playing?,I would like to see a girl play.  Be nice.  The university of Iowa painted their visitors locker rooms pink.  Must have been to mess with the other team.
1640,That would be cool. I wonder if the pink locker room actually affected the team at all?,I doubt it.  lol  In the 1960's someone would have been better off to be a top bowler rather than a top football star of the day because bowlers made twice as much money as the footballers did.
1641,Wow that's pretty amazing. I would have never guessed that. I bet bowlers don't make a whole lot these days.,I bet nowhere near as much as the players.  However, the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are more than the earnings of an average football player.
1642,That's interesting. I guess because NFL careers are usually pretty short.,That would be my guess.  Do you know what the highest score ever was for a college football game?
1643,I saw it was 222-0. That is just insane!,Talk about a blowout!  I was surprised to find out that there is actually only 11 minutes of live gameplay per an average NFL game.  I thought it would have been a little more than that.
1644,I can't believe it's only 11 minutes of gameplay. I would have never guessed  that. Must be all of the huddles and play calling.,Yes and tv timeouts. lol  How about RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis.  The former Patriots running back never fumbled the ball once in his NFL career.
1645,That's pretty amazing to never fumble your entire career.,I know.  I wonder how many carries he had?  Did you know that ESPN won an emmy for the superimposed yellow first down line you see while watching games?
1646,I have no idea. Do you listen to the radio?,I love listening to the radio!  How about you?
1647,I do too. Especially in my commute into work. Did you know Jupiter has radio storms so strong they can be heard on Earth?,Same here.  I actually listen to a lot of sports talk radio.  I didn't know that about Jupiter.  How cool is that?
1648,The NFL is a professional american football league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the NFC and AFC,Hi, how are you? Are you a football fan? Do you follow the NFL? Which of the 32 teams do you like?
1649,Chicago is my favourite team. What about you >,I usually root for the underdog in the Superbowl. :) Did you know that there's only 11 minutes of live gameplay in an NFL game? That's a great salary on a per-minute basis.
1650,New orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any NFL player, the cheerleader are required to leave.,I guess that to prevent relationships between players and cheerleaders. They must have had problems in the past.
1651,The players want to focus on the game, I think is the good rules.,True. Speaking of women, I wonder when women will play in the NFL. There's no rule against it.
1652,Now, Radio is hear by only few peoples. You listen to radio ?,I used to listen to the radio when I was a kid. Now I use the Internet, which is much more convenient.
1653,Jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an am radio.,I don't know that I would want to listen. Probalby not as good as Top 40.
1654,Do you play football ?,Not really a football player. Heard that back in the 60s, top bowlers made more than pro football players. Things certainly have changed.
1655,There different variations of football are known as football codes.,I don't know the rules for the other forms of football. Seems to be a universal sport. I wonder if any of those teams paints their visiting team's locker room pink.
1656,Its the most lovable sports by many people.  Its has so much fans.,Are you going to watch the Super Bowl this weekend? Which of the teams is your favorite?
1657,Yes, Yellow line representing the first down line for american football games.,ESPN won an award for that feature in the televised games! It makes it easier for viewers to understand the game.
1658,There is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free.,I wonder what generation listens to those programs. Youngsters don't want to hear those shows.
1659,Hearing and thinking are the most two important event in brain.  It makes brain activity.,Well, it's been fun chatting!
1660,Yes, have a great day.,Bye!
1661,do you like football?,I do. U of Iowa painted the visitor locker room pink
1662,I wonder if that is supposed to have some effect on them,I wonder too. Bowlers made more than them in the 60s too
1663,yeah. Do you know the highest score in college football?,Yes it was 222-0 when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland
1664,Yeah and that was back in 1916,Yeah and still holds. Did you know ESPN won and EMmy once?
1665,Yes that was for the superimposed yellow line,I am glad they did that, it has made game watching easier
1666,True. Do you know who Benjarvus Green-Ellis is?,Yes the guy that never fumbled the ball. Do you watch tv?
1667,Yes I do. Do you like the SImpsons?,I sure do. There is an episode where Bart does not appear
1668,Yes and he is not even mentioned in it,Yeah. How about That 70s SHow?
1669,I liked it but it really flopped in the UK,Yes after just 10 episodes because it was remade verbatim
1670,Yeah. DId you ever see Pokemon?,Yes I have seen only some of the 750 episodes that are out there
1671,Yeah that is a lot. Nice chat today,Same here
1672,Hi, how are you? Are you following the Colin Kaepernick/Eric Reid drama?,Reid, 26 year old pick out of LSU, played some linebacker out of necessity in 2017
1673,Yes he did. He is in the middle of a lawsuit against the NFL for collusion. SInce he is a top safety, I think he has a good case...,He tweet " people who know football know who can play. people who know me, know my character".
1674,Yeah, he's really talented and shouldn't have been out of the league at all. For a simple protest not to kil African Americans at a disproportional rate compared to whites.,Football is a family of team sports that involve, but we become one nation to achieve for the nation.
1675,Although some find him cowardly, I find Kaepernick extremely brave for giving up football to take a stand against police killing his people. What are your thoughts.,He is best player but the football missed him very much.
1676,Yeah. I get sad when people bang on him but I find him strong and able to start the movement. I find more white people unwilling to learn about him and the movement, which makes it tough to argue with them...,Television sometimes shortened to tele is a great communication medium.
1677,Yes, it is. Is there a favorite communication meidum that you like?,Very much. Television is a mass medium for advertising.
1678,That's interesteding. I really like to watch sports on tv. Do you?,For watching football only i buy the TV. What your favourate team ?
1679,I am from Chicago and move the bears. What about you?,I move to Atlanta. You played tennis ?
1680,Sorry, love the Chciago Bears. I do enjoy tennis. You? Are you watching the Australian open on tv?,Some time i watch it.  Wimbledon is my favourite tournament.
1681,Nice... I want to eventually go and watch that tournament. I think it would be fun. But I also think I would be soooo hot in the stands. Is tennnis your favorite sport?,yes, Its one man show. Strong body and mental required for it.
1682,I didn't know that there is only 1 episode of "The Simpsons" where bart neither appears, nor is mentioned,Well, I much less, I find out. And I see that program, I like it
1683,Did you know that the highest score in football game was 222-0, but it was really while ago. It's surprising fact.,Yes, I had read something in particular about it, it's something surprising. They should have played alone in the field, that team weighed the other
1684,I was always surprised that there isn't any written rule against female players in NFL. And still don't understand why women don't play,It's a very strange thing, there are many women capable for these types of sports, but good.
1685,I agree. Well, maybe with average NFL game only 11 minutes of live gameplay, it's not interesting for ladies.,There will come a time when the first will be encouraged and so will the others
1686,did you know that New orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any NFL player,How curious is that? Well, I have some thought of some because of it, but. What do you think?
1687,I think it's kind of stupid and old style rule. It doesn't make any sense.,Well, I suppose it's because of creating bonds in the middle of all this, it's not good for players to have their head in something else
1688,:) it could be true. However, to require to leave a place when NFL player comes... well,I'm not sure in that...,We are not sure of anything, they are pure speculations ... But we must not remove the possibility
1689,true. Did you know that locker room for visiting team in the University of Iowa is completely painted pink?,Or yes, yes ... Also today something about this, it is rumored that it is for the visiting team to know that they are better and this feels less
1690,some people may call it as sort of pressure, but I'm not sure.,To me that could cause me rather desire to cover their mouths and beat them to learn. But hey, all this is part of the show
1691,I agree. NFL is all about performance!,Well of course. What is worth there is the best performance, the better the teams, the better the matches
1692,Yes! My pleasure to talk with you. Have a good day!,Also, have a great day
1693,Hello hows it going? Do you like football?  I didn't know women can play in the NFL.,I didn't know that either! It's possible they only allow it because they think it very unlikely a woman will make a team.
1694,Yeah, I don't ever see any play for the NFL though lol Maybe they just value their health,  it is scary being a football player they get injured all the time,Yeah, I wonder if that is why they don't make more than the average engineer!  Their careers tend to be short with all of the injuries
1695,It looks like the use to technology has been beneficial to football,  they put tracking chips in their players!,That is crazy to me, the technology that is in NFL games now.  Like how they were saying that the last time that Jim Nantz called a Dallas-Washington game, it was so much less technical.  No first down lines, no fancy replays.
1696,The replays nowadays are excellent,  the frame by frame picture and the playback and forward.  Its amazing.  Also,  the way the announcers can kinda draw on the screen,  really techy stuff.,I can't decide if I like the technology or not.  It helps make things fair and makes it nice to watch.  But it probably slows things down.  It was pretty eye-opening that an average game only has 11 minutes of actual live gameplay
1697,yeah,  you are probably right,  11 minutes of game play but the actual event last like 3 hours! lol,Yep, though somehow, I still watch and enjoy the games.  I can actually remember the season that Jim last called that game, because the Cowboys beat my team that year when they won the Superbowl!  Crazy to think back that far
1698,In the 1960 s bowlers made more than football players.  I guess a lot more people watched bowling more back then!,Ha!  I can't even imagine that.  It shows how much football has changed in the last 60 years, how much players earn now versus then
1699,I know right,  super interesting what was more popular back then.,I guess I am a pretty casual fan, because I had never noticed the "cross-flexing" thing before.  It is interesting how much they play the ratings numbers now, to get the best games at the best times.  I didn't know that 80% of the country got that late afternoon game
1700,That is a weird tactic,  painting the opposing teams locker room pink?  I wonder what that does?,Anything to get inside their head, I guess!  I guess it is implying they're girly?  The thing that stuck out to me as being the oddest fact was that the Saints cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as an NFL player!  I wonder what the reason for that is
1701,Probably they can't interact with football players because a distraction?  maybe.  It's pretty rude,  like what if they are not done eating!?,The NFL really is kind of a crazy thing, because this country is just SO into it.  I can't even believe the TV contracts.  A billion dollars for the rights to just half of the games is nuts!  But they can make money on it because the country is full of such rabid fans
1702,True,  football is a huge money maker.  i kinda don't understand it though,  like why its so popular,  so many breaks,  only 11 min of gameplay,  injured all the time,  a ton of penalties,  switching out players,  offense and defense etc.,In a close game, the slow pace kind of makes the splash plays that much more exciting.  Then again there are games like that last Cowboys-Redskins game they mentioned, where the Cowboys just racked up 38 unanswered points.  And when it's that easy for a team, it's kind of fun to watch your team do well like that.
1703,do you like the NFL?,I do actually, Did you know that women can play too?
1704,Yes there is not rule that prevents them from playing,Yes as long as they can meet the requirements they are good to play
1705,Yeah. Did you know there are only 11 minutes of gameplay?,yeah and yet we are glued to the tv for hours
1706,Yeah. Did you know engineers make more money though over the lifetime?,Well they do have longer careers too though so that makes sense
1707,Yeah they have more time to make money if you think it that way,Yeah. Did you hear of that rule for Saints cheerleaders?
1708,Yes they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players,Yes and worst, they also have to leave mid meal when they walk in
1709,Yeah it is sexist and it needs to go really,I agree. U of Iowa painted the visitor locker room pink
1710,WOw I wonder if that is supposed to have some impact on them,I wonder too. Bowlers made more money in the 60s that football players
1711,Wow I guess it was a much more popular sport back in the day than football,Yeah true. Do you know what the highest score in college football is?
1712,Yes it is 222-0 and Georgia Tech beat Cumberland,Yeah what a score that must have been even for 1916
1713,did you know that Trump wouldn't make the list of top 3 most wealthy presidents?,No, but this is just his first term in office.. Who knows what the future holds? He might make a blockbuster pop album (like the President of Indonesia) which might put him over the top!
1714,haha that is true we can't count that out! not just 1 but he could make 3 or more albums if he wants to top that president of Indonesia!,Who knows. He's friends with Kanye West these days. It could happen! I wonder if Kanye stayed at the President's guest house when he came to Washington recently. After all, the guest house is bigger than the White house!
1715,ya that is wild, you would think it'd be the opposite, can you imagine if we had the old rules where the runner up became VP? Hillary as VP and Trump as President!,I would love to hear Trump say to Hillary, "You're Fired!"  I can't imagine the types of things the fake media would focus on then. With all the bizarre reporting, at least they don't call him President Banana, which is what they called the first President of Zimbabwe
1716,haha ya I would love for him to have her come into his office and then tell her she's FIRED, do you watch football at all? I guess there is no rule against women playing for the NFL so we will probably see that in our lifetime if they are good enough,That is true in the NFL, but I am not sure if it is true in other forms of football, like rugby, canadian football, Gaelic football, etc. Does that mean we would see male Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders too?
1717,To be honest nothing would surprise me anymore, weren't they talking about making cheerleaders more equivalent and having men as cheerleaders? Like I am pretty sure that is a thing they're working on.,College football has male cheerleaders on the squads. I remember seeing them at a University of Iowa game. I also heard that their visitors locker room was pink.
1718,lol, that is funny, ya I saw that is in Iowa's away team locker room, I'm frankly shocked the team wasn't arrested for intolerance or gender discrimination given today's overreactions and political climate,I think political correctness has gone too far lately.
1719,ya now that sounds like a complete opposite of today, what is shocking to me is that there is only about 11 mins of actual live gameplay during an average football game, seems like that is low,And most of that is hang time for punts!  Lots of surprising trivia about football. Did you know Patriots running back, Green-Ellis, has never fumbled the ball? I wonder if he still plays for the Pats and if so, if he will play this weekend.
1720,I did not know that, I hope that the Pats win the Superbowl again this year, Tom Brady is a great American,Well, I hope he stays healthy and can play a few more seasons. I'm sure he needs the cash An average lifetime earnings for an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings for an NFL player. And Brady has a model wife he has to feed!
1721,haha that is true! I did read that his wife actually makes more money then he does. I don't know what she does but I found that to be really wild!,I hope the score of the superbowl game is high. Not as high as that historic  222-0 Georgia Tech romp  over Cumberland!
1722,that is true that's a crazy score! I think once it hit 100 to 0, I would just turn the game off and know which side was the winning team haha,But if you turned the TV off, you would miss those Emmy award winning virtual yellow lines ESPN puts on the field. That is worth the price of admission!
