0,I think I did hear something about that.  I imagine it is an attempt to psych the other team out.
1,Right.  Teams do all kinds of things to bother the competition. I've heard of teams having heated benches in the winter for themselves but not for the visitors.
2,I'd rather watch it inside where it's warm.  Have you heard about the Georgia Tech-Cumberland game of 1916?
3,Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland but here's the thing, they defeated them by a score of 222-0!
4,I don't know but it did.  It's the highest scoring game in history.
5,I guess it depended on what team you were pulling for.  To me, it's surprising that the highest scoring game was in college football and not professional.
6,Good point.  Professional does have a player that has never fumbled the ball.
7,It was. It was a running back by the name of Benjarvus Green Ellis.
8,i guess so.  Do you watch espn?
9,Oh, I was going to tell you about them winning an emmy but that's okay.  Well, do you watch or have you watched pokemon?
10,That is funny.  Pokemon is pretty popular and has been for a while now  They have over 750 tv episodes alone.  Well, I have to go now.  It's been nice chatting with you!  Have a great day!
11,It's sad. I wonder how many people grew up hearing his voice?
12,I like that he used this phrase alot Whoa, Nellie!
13,I didn't. I did see the ABC would not let him retire at 70!
14,He was also a marine. Looks like he had been calling games since he was young.
15,Crazy busy it seems. He didn't say anything when Woody Hayes punched a clemson player either!
16,I don't think he saw the punch. He also won an Emmy!
17,apparently for the work he did calling the games. He was inducted into the sportscasters hall of fame too.
18,probably so. Snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his son's high school football team.
19,no, it doesn't say anything more about it. Sorry. I can tell you this though. The highest paid across all u.s. department of defense employees are three football coaches of the service branch teams
20,14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums belong to american college football teams! I guess it is a pretty popular sport.
21,I watch it from time to time as I enjoy it. do you have a favorite player?
22,Go figure. do you know who kareem abdul-jabaar was?
23,yeah so strange. do you know what the nz basketball team is called?
24,Yeah I am not too sure but that is certainly what they are called
25,Good for them, how handy to play there at work.
26,I guess it pays to be a coach then. the players themselves also get paid quite a bit too. do you listen to the radio much?
27,Actually if you turn it to am you can catch Jupiter's storms
28,Yes very true. do you know how soldiers used to make radios during WWII?
29,I do not even know what channels they would be able to listen to
30,The one that gives the news in latin right?
31,Hi, no not really.  Are you?
32,I get that, especially when there is only 11 minutes of action in a game.  I guess the rest is commercials?
33,I know! They sure do milk it for all its worth.
34,Yeah, that was a good addition. Can't believe that Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled.  Amazing!
35,Yeah, that's what I would think.  NFL careers are probably pretty short on average due to injury, and it is really hard to get to the majors and stick there long enough to make any serious money
36,Maybe we will!  That would help boost ratings, I would think.  Maybe then they'll start letting the Saint's cheerleaders eat in the same restaurants as the players.  What a stupid rule!
37,Do you a cat?  They are amazing creatures.  One is a mayor in Alaska!
38,Yes!  They can pay by the hour to play with cats and have drinks. Seems like a cool place!
39,That's a life well lived lol.  Cats can also co-author physics papers!
40,I wonder who that cat ran against?  It would've been funny if the other candidate was a dog!
41,Me too.  Have a great day!
42,Hi! Yes I do sometimes. What's your favorite team?
43,My husband is from the bay area so we root for the Oakland Raiders.
44,222-0
45,Georgia tech and cumberland. Are you familiar with different kinds of football from different parts of the world?
46,I'm originally from Hungary and our football there is soccer. My grandpa was a huge fan.
47,I had no idea. I wonder why the University of Iowa's locker room is painted pink.
48,Oh ok I see. Do you watch basketball?
49,I didn't know that either. Or that in 39 out of 50 states, the highest paid state employee is either a college football or basketball coach. There is lots of money in sports.
50,James Naismith. Interesting that he is the only losing coach in the University of Kansas history
51,I haven't heard of it. Do you know where it is located?
52,What is your favorite basketball team?
53,I know, right? I thought it was weird how the cheerleaders arent allowed to eat in the same restaurants as the nfl players.
54,I wonder if that was meant to try to demoralize the players
55,I was shocked that the highest score in a football game was 222... THATS CRAZY!
56,Yea it has... could you imagine if bowlers were paid more than nfl players now? They would make average 6-12 million a year for bowling lol
57,I already knew that, which is why I get so frustrated with how long a game takes :(
58,I thought it was pretty cool that the cat in the opening scene of the Godfather, was just a stray. Chances are that was an unplanned scene.
59,I think its a waste of money lol just get a cat
60,Everywhere including Alaska... where they are made mayors. Now thats weird lol
61,Im not sure the actual purpose of either, but they are both pretty strange!
62,yea, Im 35 right now... I couldn't imagine sleeping 12 years of that. No wonder cats are considered lazy lol
63,I will say that I was pleased to see that at least an engineer has higher wages than an nfl or mlb player. I faithfully believe that sport players are WAY overpaid.
64,Hugh waste! I think that a percentage of the earned income should automatically go to funding projects or foundations that better the citizens lives or economy.
65,Doing good? Do you follow football at all? It's a family of sports that includes rugby, gridiron, and soccer
66,Yea I enjoy gridiron, I also think rugby football is pretty interesting too, would love to play it
67,Yea, I wonder if there is any other football variation types besides American football, soccer, and rugby
68,I wonder how much money other footballers make, in the US an average engineer makes more than an average nfl player over their lifetime
69,I wonder if soccer players are tracked like how the NFL embeds chips into shoulder pads and footballs to track things like velocity and location
70,No, I guess not. It's funny how the nfl tracks all these stats yet the average game only has 11 minutes of gameplay
71,Yea that was excruciating to watch. Do you have a favorite nfl team out of the 32?
72,Yea the patriots are a great team. Did you know apparently Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled the ball in his career?
73,Yea that pretty tough, probably tougher than the time Georgia tech scored 222 points on Cumberland back in 1916
74,Lol well the fans in Philli do have a bad reputation so I'm not surprised there was an actual court inside the stadium
75,I do. I am getting ready to watch the playoff games
76,Absolutely and the Patriots.
77,Yeah, its a bit hypocritical of the team and the NFL to have a rule like that
78,Didn't he fumble a couple of weeks ago?
79,This years 17-week season has wrapped up and now we hit the playoffs. Who do you think will win the Super Bowl this year?
80,Yes. I am worried though this may be the last year of Brees and Brady. I will have to find a young QB to follow now
81,I am really loving watching that kid above all the other young QBs in the NFL.
82,A little bit. I am a secret fan of the Chiefs. I follow Ohio State on the college level
83,Yeah, thats a bit ridiculous. I need to look at pics online to see what it looks like.
84,You as well
85,I think there was a womens' league years ago but I am not sure. It was not the NFL though.
86,Something like that yes. But I think if a woman wants to play in the NFL and is good enough, she should be allowed.
87,Cheerleading is really hard! You have to be athletic. I have a male friend who was a cheerleader in high school and he was great at it.
88,I hadn't heard that! Wow. I have heard that cheerleaders have a lot of strict rules though. Do the football players have a lot of rules they have to follow?
89,Haha! I can't believe how much football coaches get paid. I heard that the coaches for the military teams get paid more than anyone else in the department of defense. That's crazy!
90,It seems like it is very easy to get injuries that can end a career. So engineers probably are able to put in a lot more years at their jobs.
91,I went to high school with someone who played for the Panthers. Now he sells cars. You're right about priorities though. Football is more important than academics in most high schools and colleges. They spend a lot of money on it.
92,I heard there is a high school stadium in Texas that cost $60 million. I don't really think that is right.
93,I heard that 14 of the world's largest stadiums belong to college football teams... I wonder how many of those are state schools. Our taxes shouldn't be paying for that.
94,That is true. I think maybe it would be better if instead of school teams it was more like the European soccer system, where you grow up playing for a club and then go pro.
95,I've enjoyed talking about football! I have to go and have my dinner now.
96,Yes I do, I am especially interested right now in following Jordan Reed to see if he will really be able to take the next step in his promising career after his surgery.
97,Well, Jordan Reed is on the Redskins, so I am following them currently.
98,Yes, I had heard that before! I wonder how much money football players made in that time. I heard that in the 1960s it was only half as much as popular bowlers of the time.
99,I was also surprised to learn that ESPN won an Emmy for creating that yellow first down line graphic on television. I never realize that sports media could also win those Hollywood awards!
100,No, I guess that the yellow line thing was so innovative for American football media coverage at the time that it was considered worthy of an award!
101,No, I didn't, but that's impressive. I wonder if they have used those NFL tracking chips in the shoulder pad to record his speed and velocity and stuff?
102,Oh, that's a good point! Well either way it's too bad that football players even that talented only make half as much as engineers
103,Yeah but also it sounds like they control your life quite a bit! Even other athletes such as the NFL New Orleans Saints cheerleaders have strict rules against eating in a restaurant at the same time as an NFL player.
104,Wow, so the NFL actually treats women better as players than the cheerleaders get treated apparently!
105,Merry Christmas to you, and I'll leave you with this fun fact: The university of Iowa's locker room provided for visiting football players is completely painted pink!
106,I thought that was funny, hopefully the teams are good sports.
107,I am a fan, what about you?
108,I did, I was rooting for the patriots, what about you? the game was really close and really defensive not sure if I liked it
109,Its actually the Superbowl with the fewest points scored, and the Patriots have done things right that is for sure, they used to have a great player called Benjarvus Green Ellis.
110,I know, that is really impressive! I bet only a few players have accomplished that, maybe he is the only one, did you know that ESPN won an emmy because of the creation of the first down line
111,The yellow line has been there a long time and I think that the emmy is well deserved as it has definetely contributed with a lot to the game.
112,It does, I guess thats why games were so unfair in old times, there was a team that lost by 222 points
113,I know, it seems like the other team was blind or they were all injured, another interesting fact is that bowlers made more than football players back in 1960
114,I guess thats a safer sport, football has proven to cause a lot of brain damage in players so thats not good.
115,I think ive seen that film before, I will google it later or maybe its available in Netflix, there is a crazy rules the New Orlans Saints have, its really sexist and rude in fact.
116,I know right, I mean cheerleaders could actually sue the team for something like that, its a rule that should be abolished
117,I am a fan, my Thursday nights wouldn't be the same withou that sacred sport, what about you?
118,It seems like the Thursday packages isnt going anywhere so that is a good thin, did you know Disney is the owner of ABC and ESPN?
119,Yeah seems like they are buying everything these days, Star Wars, Marvel and now those two channels as well
120,It was  great channel I liked it as well, crazy how much money TV moves and also how much money football moves, $900 million for Thursday night games alone
121,No I didnt know that, its terrible, I wonder why, have you watched The Bing Bang Theory?
122,Well its a really funny show, it has an average of 18 million viewers. The NBC has great series in it.
123,I didnt know about that, what do you think about that rule? would you like to watch a woman in the NFL?
124,Yeah I dont think its a good sport to mix genres, do you know who Matt Patricia is?
125,Matt Patricia is a male lol, he is a rocket scientist and also a coach in the NFL
126,Patricia its a girls name so don't worry its an honest mistake, he must be a really smart guy though being a rocket scientist and all
127,No didn't know that, 11 minutes of live playtime doesn't seem right, anyways im getting kind of tired, its late so Im going to call it a night.
128,It is going well.  I'm considering catching a movie - what will you do today?
129,I agree - Patriots did their job - too bad for the Rams. I think I'll catch a Disney movie - the Ralph and the Internet sounds good - that's a sequel to a movie that was in the works for a long time!
130,Can the Patriots keep it up forever, that's the key - I think the risks of football are a bit high, however. I'm glad Disney keeps at it. Of course Disneyland, all the hype and all the merchandise, makes movie-making well worth it.
131,Did you ever wonder how TV gets all those great shots of plays at the football games - apparently they use tracking chips embedded in shoulder pads - yikes, someone is always watching you! I liked that commercial about the guy going to heaven and getting the new car from his grandpa - then he woke up and was in his cubicle at work and someone had Heimleched him - so funny!
132,Good idea about the end zone. The commercial was in the Super Bowl and cracked me up because when the guy recovered after being apparently gone for a bit - it was back to work  - and he really wanted the car! So funny!
133,Sounds like you are a big fan - funny fact, an average engineer makes more in his lifetime than the average pro football player - I think engineering is safer.
134,I think that the political controversies of the past few years hasn't helped the sport too much - some people just want to watch folks play ball. I see the Patriots owner is in trouble today - so that's another negative out there.  Back to Disney - are there any animation films up for oscars this year?
135,Isn't the Incredibles 2 movie out there as well? My kids saw it and liked it - sounds like it had some dark moments too - maybe beyond little kids ages. Speaking of football salaries -a fun fact - in the 60's a professional bowler made more than an NFL player.
136,I'm sure TV had a lot to do with it. Another fun fact - the highest scoring game was in 1916 when Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland 222 to 0. Ouch.  Poor coach!
137,I bet the coach changed careers after that - how can you carry on with that on your resume. I guess this will be turn 10 - right? Should we wrap it up? Hope you have a good day if that's true.
138,Not with her on it.  I heard it is still going, but maybe under a different name.
139,Very much so, it also showed real struggles, which didnt happen much either.
140,Everyone has the right to their opinion.  Sometimes it is just best for those in the public eye to be careful how they state theirs.
141,I didn't watch it.  But i heard that the portrayal caused some problems, because it treated politics as irrelevant.
142,I wonder if that made the flowers they got from the Simpsons crew.... irrelevant..  LOL
143,I dont, honestly I dont even recall that episode.  There are so many of them.
144,Yeah, like 15 years ago....  lol
145,Well you might recognize some voices, Ringo Star and Alec Baldwin each did 52 episodes.
146,I love Carlins explanation of the F word as all parts of speech.
147,Yeah, I just call that the menu button.  I dont know where hamburger came from.
148,Alex Smith was a great asset. He took the time to really get a feel for people
149,He was in the league a long time. At least he gave the game everything he had
150,He was a true professional.
151,Well at least he will get back up. Thankfully since the NFL uses tracking chips they can track players moves and help avoid crazy injuries
152,Yeah he is clearly smart having earned his degree so quickly
153,I'm confused as to why the saints cheerleaders cant eat in the same restaurantas the players that seems like an absurd rule
154,You needn't look hard to find proof of that
155,I wonder who will be the NFC and AFC champs that will go to the Superbowl in Feb
156,yes no OT this year
157,Its not against the rules so it is likely someone is raising the first female NFL player as we speak
158,Hi! No I did not know that, very interesting! I was reading an article about the Patriots Josh McDaniels just might take a coaching position! Do you watch football?
159,Yes, I don't follow it very much but I definitely like the Patriots. McDaniels has been one of the highest paid coordinator, crazy!
160,Wow, you would think there would be more left handers! I like how the NFL has no rules against females if they meet requirements.
161,I hope we do see females in the NFL, but man that is a tough sport and I can't imagine getting tackled. So interesting though that a full football game has only 11 minutes of actual live play...so I guess you could hang in there that long.
162,I know it is crazy. I didn't know that, very cool! There is so much that goes on during a football game!
163,Wow, haha that is pretty interesting! I love the quarterbacks in football, they are the best at being a leader for offense, love it!
164,I watch some football, don't have a lot of time to watch it. I think the huddle was invented by a deaf quarterback so nobody could outside the huddle could read the hand signals.....
165,Very interesting thought, how rough would that be to play football while being deaf. So do you watch the superbowl, there's a lot of drama this year about the NFL and superbowl.
166,We always watch the Superbowl, will have a couple people over but nothing big. I am rooting for the Patriots though!
167,Haha, that's funny! He made the right choice to get into drama! I like Jim Carrey in Drama films but he won't do drama anymore. Love his comedy too though.
168,I sure do. Did you know Jon Hamm taught drama in a high school?
169,Yeah and he even taught Ellie Kemper, she is so funny. Yeah I watch House
170,That is a  lot. Patrick Stewart also teaches drama in the UK at the master level
171,I sure do he is pretty funny. DO you like him?
172,Have you heard of the show Ikea Heights?
173,I am not sure but it is shot in California in an Ikea store and people there do not even know
174,I like them sometimes. Do you listen to them?
175,Nice. Do you know why soap operas are called as such?
176,Actually it is because there were soap manufacturers that sponsored them
177,Hmm I am not sure of that. He went to college for it?
178,Hahaha the guy really knew what he was after even that early
179,Hi, great.  You?
180,This was cool to read.  Nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field. they are also located inside footballs to track: velocity, rotation, ball speed and location.
181,I saw that also.  I agree.
182,Really?  Did she get blasted?
183,I'm glad to hear they treated her with respect, as an equal player.  An average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay
184,Yeah, that's pretty crazy.  The average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player and an average mlb player.
185,I'm not sure.  I think it's because NFL players do not play past their 30s normally
186,Not really.  I've played but I'm terrible at it.  The average american golf course consumes around 312,000 gallons of water per day.
187,Wow, me too.  Samuel l. jackson puts a golf clause in his film contracts that allows him to play golf twice a week during production.
188,Haha, yep it is.
189,You as well.  Have a great day.
190,i do like sports. i dont get much chance to watch these days. you?
191,i bet it didnt hurt that he was a great baseball player. he could any ball a mile.
192,that is an insane amount of water for just a bunch of grass. i wonder how much that costs actually.
193,rich people have their priorities. i could never afford to play golf, i think.
194,i guess the oil makees them rich and money changes peoples perception of reality. in the future they might regret the waste.
195,i wonder how many people in the us actually play golf. its a good sport for business but i think the cost must be prohibitive.
196,i do like to watch football. only get the chance from time to time. You?
197,i heard something about that, but then again i dont think they ever imagined a woman showing up to try out.
198,well, i am opposed to concussions and injuries, so would probably go with engineer.
199,Or i could just be a supermodel. not many concussions either. Anyway, nice chat!
200,I liked to play with my dad when I was younger, but don't keep much up with it now. I like football and other sports more. How about you?
201,Yeah, but seems a little sexist, frankly. It's a pretty sexist industry of a whole, despite technically allowing women to play.
202,Haha, I bet the division is way more than twice the amount now, too. It's much better to be an engineer, these days, though.
203,Yeah, that line makes watching the game on TV much easier.
204,I'm a Cowboys fan, myself, even though we'll never make it to the Super Bowl again, it seems.
205,Haha, well if that's what it takes to make it to the Super Bowl, Cowboys have it in the bag! We still miss old school Romo, I think. He was good in the beginning.
206,Yeah, and they put all these tracking chips in everything!
207,I'm not surprised, everything is connected to an app you can talk to so of course things are constantly listening. Even small chips have to communicate to each other somehow.
208,Maybe it's another deflate-gate all over again! They could be in the footballs, and able to change the pressure!
209,Yeah, it's incredibly wasteful. There's one in Dubai that uses four million. Anyway, it's been fun talking to you about sports!
210,I do.  I watched the last superbowl on tv.
211,It is nice to be able to talk about it with coworkers and friends.  Do you know that lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than lifetime earnings of an average nfl player.
212,I am surprised.  Football players (top ones) make much more money than bowlers now.
213,Americans love NFL games. Do you know that it has 32 teams divided equally between NFC and AFC?
214,NFL uses tracking chips to record every move by players.
215,It is neat.  That way, the teams can strategize their games.
216,There is no rule but I do not think most women are interested in joining American football teams.  This type of football is too physical, unlike soccer.
217,That is incredible.  I need to read more about him.
218,It is rather boring to me.  I have never watched world series, even on tv.
219,I am glad that I'm not alone.  I feel bad since my best friend is into it.
220,I love NFL, and you?
221,If they can ball they can play lol
222,The university of iowa visitor locker room is already pink.
223,What if the NFL player was female then?
224,Did you know espn invented the yellow line?
225,To them it is still a show I guess.  In 1916 georgia tech won 222 to zero
226,If I were cumberland, the losing team, I would have given up by the first quarter!
227,In the 60;s, pro bowlers made more than football players
228,I have heard that.  I think it is a little misleading because the average NFL career is only 3-4 years and they still have time to find a career at 24 or 25 years old lol.
229,I hate the patriots.  That is amazing about the Giants.  Beat them alleged Cheaters every time!  The are the Lannisters of the NFL.
230,Yeah I know.  Enough is enough...I hope he goes back to the Browns haha.  Take care
231,Hi. The NFL seems to be at the end of its days.
232,What about the problems with the NCAA though? The NFL needs the players.
233,What about the fans though. People might get bored of a game when the quality goes down.
234,I wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest, get more fans.
235,I see your point. Long term, will women stay? True.
236,Women can be tough too. Would a coach like Bill Belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the Super Bowl?
237,Belichick has done well in the post season, so I think he's looking at it from a strategic point of view. The sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products.
238,Tom Brady and Belichick have done well together. I wonder how Brady would react to a woman in the huddle.
239,I wonder whether the male players would get jealous of the coverage she gets. If there is revenue sharing, they might not care because they make more $
240,Wow, she is awesome. The violence of the NFL is a bit different though. I wonder if the male players might be hesitant to smash her hard.
241,Are you a New England Patriots fan?
242,And sorry, yes I watch football. I am not a fan of the Patriots either! lol I did know about the rule allowing female players. I'm surprised no females play tho
243,Haha that is hilarious! I agree with George RR Martin! Did you know that the highest scoring game in football was 222-0? That blows my mind!
244,It certainly is! I can't imagine being the losing team. I can't fathom any team scoring 222 points tho either!
245,Haha I hope so too! I'm surprised that espn won an emmy for creating the yellow line representing the first down. I had no clue!
246,Oh wow, I didn't know that either. It certainly seems like a lot of science and tech are involved in the game.
247,That's really interesting. And yea, they can certainly do all kinds of things for the viewers at home to see. I've heard that nfl engineers make more in their lifetime than the nfl players. That's hard to believe given how much the players gets paid!
248,Haha yea I rather be the engineer too! And wow, bowlers?! No way! Haha
249,I guess. I know my grandparents were very serious bowlers haha They only brought home trophies, not cash tho!
250,That's cool. I always thought it was fun to go bowling.
251,Love NFL football!
252,Espn won emmy for that
253,I did not know that 14 of the 25 largest stadium belong to college football
254,Not that pink is for females only but there is no rule against a female playing
255,I think we would need to see one in college or Canadian first.
256,Wow, lucky for the Patriots that happened a long time ago.
257,I think they cheated the Raiders with the tuck rule, they underinflated balls, and they recorded others practices.  Who knows what else?
258,I did not know belichick coached the browns.
259,His only other playoff win with another team.
260,All of their wins and losses were by 3 or 4 points too
261,Hey! I have always like the Dallas Cowboys!
262,Holy cow that's a high score!!! They must have been scoring everytime they touched the ball!
263,I bet not.I know I wouldn't if I played for them. I heard the average lifetime earnings for an NFL player is lower than that of an engineer
264,Football is a fun sport, but with the relatively low pay and the injury rate, it makes me wonder why people would want to do it.
265,HAHAHA! Now that is hilarious! What an awesome thing to do! lol
266,Bill Belichick is the winningest NFL postseason coach. No wonder with the Patriots!
267,Eww, incest galore!
268,The Lannister reference...it's from Game of Thrones, and that family was incestual to keep the blood line "pure"
269,Well that's crazy! I'd say it was sexist, but there isn't any rule in the NFL that females can't play.
270,You too!
271,I have heard that before.I wonder if any women will be able to make the NFL one day.
272,I'm not really into NFL. Maybe it's because there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay in each game.
273,But NFL has become so popular over the years. In the 60s, top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars.
274,I believe bowling was televised. My dad told me he used to watch it on TV
275,But even today, NFL players don't make as much on average as I would think. Engineers earn more over a lifetime.
276,It's amazing how much technology is used in the NFL these days
277,And it's interesting how ESPN won an Emmy for that yellow line they created.
278,It is very helpful to view football though.
279,Yes, most of the best inventions are very simple. Do you like the Patriots?
280,Bill Belichick has the most wins in NFL postseason football-20 with the Patriots and 1 with the Cleveland Browns.
281,NFL? You mean the National Football League?
282,Television was forbidden in my house growing up, so I did not get much chance to watch. What about you?
283,Oh, ok then. I guess we all have different childhoods. The TV is an influence on the mind. What do you like about the NFL football?
284,Oh, ok, it's an alcoholic event. I see. With the shouting and cheering and whatnot. Do you have a favorite team or player? I guess there are a bunch of teams.
285,The Redskins? Are they named after the Native Americans?
286,Why the Redskins though? Isn't that a name to mock the American Indians?
287,Oh, ok. I thought that a team in Washington would have a very American name, like the Patriots or something.
288,I see. I guess people choose the name that suits the spirit of the team or the town. I have never been to Washington DC, but I imagine there must be lots of Native peoples there.
289,I did not know there was a state named New England. I've heard of New York and New Hampshire.
290,Oh, I see. That is the place of the Patriots. I think that NFL football is an interesting lesson in US history.
291,Yes and he is amazing. They have been comparing Khalil Mack to Lawrence Taylor.
292,He definitely looked impressive this year. He earned the pay he received. He is the highest paid defensive player in the history of the game now.
293,I did not. What a strange thing to do. Speaking of football, did you know that in the 1960's top bowlers made more than top football players?!
294,I do not. What is it?
295,What?! How is a score that high even possible?
296,No kidding. Did you know that ESPN won an Emmy for the creation of the yellow line that marks the first down? Could you imagine not having that on screen?
297,I did not. That's amazing. Do you remember his name by any chance?
298,I will have to look into him. I do not remember the name. Speaking of the Patriots, did you know that George RR Martin called them the Lannisters of the NFL? I don't see that as being a compliment ha ha.
299,Oh wow. Everyone always talks about their wins but I did realize they were also tied for losses.
300,They have been awful for a long time. They seem to be better the last year.
301,I feel let down and aggravated to be honest.  It almost makes me want to boycott Gillette since they sponsor them.  How do you feel?
302,Yeah I know. I can't help but wonder if he cheats in some way.  On the ironic side though, they patriots are tied with the bills for the most losses at super bowls.
303,Did you know that Bill Belichick used to coach for the cleveland browns and that their last playoff win was when he was their coach?
304,I know. We may still yet if Baker Mayfield has his way.  Football is so popular and important that it's hard to believe that back in the 1960's bowlers made more than football players.
305,Now that is surprising.  I always assumed players were among the super rich.  I would think that Benjarvus Green-Ellis would especially be super rich.  He has never fumbled the ball in his career and he's a running back.
306,It really is and surprising. I had no idea until recently that the nfl put tracking chips in players shoulder pads.
307,I've heard that.  I guess that's how they knew Brady was cheating that time.  You know they do all of this studying and stuff and in reality a game only has 11 minutes of actual game playing.
308,Why, did that game last a really long time or something?
309,Oh my! i bet it did go on forever!  What was the other team's score?
310,With that kind of score I definitely agree.  I guess Cumberland not only had no defense but no offense as well.
311,Hi there, I am a fan, but not a huge fan, I do follow my team closely though.  How about you?
312,I am from Wisconsin, so I follow the Packers, we didn't even make the playoffs this year, so disappointing.
313,I have been to a few games, and I have been to Louisiana and saw the super dome as well.  I would like to go back there now that I am older.
314,Yeah I know he has won a few games there.  Did you know he was picked 19th back in the 2000 NFL draft?
315,Yeah he sure has, I don't think he will retire for at least two more seasons.
316,Yeah he was a really good quarterback as well, I thought he was pretty funny as well.
317,That is insane, I don't know how you can be as old as he is and not eat a strawberry.
318,That is crazy, that rule seems so outdated and silly.  Imagine a cheerleader getting up and leaving.
319,Yeah it really is double standards and that type of thing is old and not normal anymore.
320,Yeah that is also a shame when you consider how much players make.
321,Same here, I hope you have a good night.
322,Hi! I do occasionally, usually during big games like Super Bowl.
323,I agree, though he is now in his 40s born in August 1977. Wonder if he might retire soon?
324,Not if they are smart. He is one of only 2 players in NFL history to have won 5 Super Bowls. Well, I guess it would be 6 now.
325,That is true. He won't be easy to forget though especially to Pats fans. He has QB'd them to 8 Super Bowls, the most of any player in history.
326,Yeah that's amazing. Hey, did you realize that the average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live game play?
327,Yeah and engineering requires a lot of knowledge and schooling. Back in the 60's top bowlers made 2x as much as top football players. That is very surprising to me.
328,That would be different. Maybe they could get a pink locker room like the Univ of Iowa has for its visiting football teams. :) So bad!!
329,Yeah that was awful for the losing team I bet. They probably could have benefited from the tracking chips they use today in the players' shoulder pads to record their moves. Maybe could have figured out what they were doing wrong.
330,Yeah but very few has her body and talents so alas they play football or work regular ole jobs. LOL
331,She's a Brazilian model (Victoria's Secret) and one of the highest paid in the world. She and Brady make a pretty cool team though both deserve what they work hard for.
332,I love the sport, do you have a favorite team? AFC or NFC?
333,AFC and the New England Patriots
334,No, not really, Bill Belichick got served, that is a sure thing but other than that I have no idea
335,Yeah the game was a bit boring though, I thought it was going to have more action in it
336,I guess better to win in a boring way than to lose in an exiting form, and 11 minutes don't seem like much
337,Yeah we have been pretty lucky and then theres also Brady, his a good luck charm
338,I have to give it to him, great athlete and also has a smoking hot wife so he has just about everything in life
339,I kind of do, I wish I had a 30th part of what he has or even less lol, and that is weird, how can he not like strawberries or even try them
340,Strawberries are so tasty, I couldn't  live without them.  He has a good TD pass record though.
341,And prior to that season he never threw 30 TD passes in a season so yeah magical
342,I don't know. The consensus among the experts seems to be that he'll keep playing.
343,Yeah, and he's been spending a lot of time on his charity work. Football doesn't seem to be his main priority.
344,Yes, I heard that too.
345,Right, and he's been talking about wanting to be there for his family more.
346,Yes, and that's caused some tensions within the team.
347,Yes! I agree!
348,Did you know that the NFL has no written rule against female players? Women would in fact be allowed if they met the league's eligibility requirements.
349,I did not know that! I wonder how many have tried out for the NFL.
350,Yeah. I wonder if it will ever happen.
351,That's awesome! Good for your son's team!
352,Yes I enjoy the game. I like the NFL even though there's only 11 minutes alive gameplay.
353,Yes as long as they meet the league's eligibility requirements they can play! I would like to see a girl play.
354,That is a weird rule. How did they enforce the rules of the cheerleaders being required to leave?
355,Yes that's a very good point. Maybe the NFL tracks cheerleaders just like it tracks players movements on the field.
356,Yes it would be I'm sure they don't do that. Although they do track the balls to measure velocity, rotation, Ball Speed, and location.
357,Yes it definitely would be. I wonder what Tom Brady's football stats are like? He is definitely one of the best as he is 5 super bowls.
358,Definitely not the patriots LOL! What about you? Tom Brady has never eaten a strawberry and his entire life. He is missing out.
359,Oh Chicago has a dedicated Fan base for sure. Soldier Field would be a fun place to watch a game. Before 2007 Tom Brady had never thrown 30 touchdown passes in a season.
360,Yup real talk! Tom Brady's wife makes double her husbands salary!
361,Yes me too. Maybe some day...I also find it funny Brady was drafted in the 6th round in 2000.
362,Wow, is it because Gronk is such a carefree, happy guy?
363,Oh, that's true. I don't think he's played all 16 games for a long time!
364,Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of the Patriots, but I admit that Belichick knows what he's doing. Besides, Robert Kraft has said a lot of admirable things about Gronkowski.
365,He is, but I guess it doesn't hurt to have Tom Brady on the team. Geez, I think he's one of only two NFL players to win 5 Super Bowls!
366,In all honestly though, I do think it's a great story that he was picked 199th in the draft, but he never lost faith in himself and ended-up being one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time!
367,I know! And Brady won the Super Bowl in the first year he was a starter!
368,I think you're right! You know what else is crazy? Six of Tom Brady's Super Bowls were decided by 3 or 4 points!
369,I think he was on the bench when Michigan won the Rose Bowl and Championship, but a lot of people still think he was the biggest steal in the history of the NFL!
370,Yeah, I think it's safe to say Brady won't be shown the door like Ty Law, Richard Seymour, Randy Moss and Chandler Jones!
371,Yep. The guy makes a lot of tough moves, and isn't sentimental about his roster. Even after losing last year, I still think they have a shot again this year.
372,All true! I guess Belichick has the football knowledge and expertise that no one else has!  They're still in first place...again, so you never know!
373,Only slightly. Why, what's up?
374,Oh yeah! The name Ray Lewis rings a bell! Have you read anything interesting about him?
375,Aw, that's sweet! What happened to his mother? Do you know?
376,Oh that is so heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time! I remember who he is now! The guy that got inducted into the pro football hall of fame! It's so touching to see someone speaking of their mother as he did in his speech!
377,I'm not really a big fan of any of them. I guess if I had to choose I'd pick the Seahawks because I love Seattle! Haha. Does that count? And do you have a favorite team?
378,Oh I've heard about that! Can you believe if one of the Saints cheerleaders is eating in ANY restaurant and ANY NFL player comes in, she has to get up and leave? What is going on with that! It's terrible!
379,Nope! I've heard that if a female made certain qualifications, then she could 100% join the NFL! I mean, it kind of tempts me to try it!
380,Oh wow, that is quite the loss! I've never heard about that game before! Here is a fun thing I was reading about that's very related! Those big American flags at football stadiums weigh 1,100 pounds and cost $50,000 to make! What a waste of money! That money could really help so many people!
381,Oh wow! I've never bowled, never in my life. I wonder how much they make today compared to one another. Hey do you like any country music? I like some, like Dolly Parton. I was just reading about how country music was inspired by Celtic music. I think that's neat!
382,Absolutely. I've heard that country music used to be called "hillbilly" music! Good thing they changed the name! I think it was Connie B. Gay who coined the actual term "country music".
383,Oh that is so cool! What a unique thing to do! Opening for yourself as another band! Very interesting! Oh, haha! Did you hear about a 1996 album called "NFL Country"? NFL players sang along with country music stars. I'd love to hear that!
384,Haha. Yeah I feel like listening to some Dolly Parton now. It was great chatting with you!
385,Can you believe Brady's JV high school football coach refused to play him?
386,Who is your favorite qb?
387,Yes, it was pretty ingenious. Now they have the Field goal attempt line too right?
388,I find it funny that the visitor's locker room at Iowa University was painted pink...lol
389,Im a huge fan of Baker Mayfield because he likes Halo 3 like me
390,Did you catch his gruesome leg injury a couple of weeks ago?
391,I thought there were other left handed QBs before?
392,I really like Sicario
393,What tv drama does he act in?
394,Michael is one of my all-time favorite actors!
395,The comedy in which he costars with Steve Martin in Scoundrels
396,yes, do you know who kellan moore is?
397,I do. Moore is the only QB that is left handed
398,Wow they sure lost talent there. Did you know Brad Johnson threw himself a touchdown?
399,Exactly why he down in history for being the only one to do it
400,No really? THat smart? Do you like drama?
401,I have it is a good show. Do you know JOn Hamm?
402,That is a lot, Hamm was a drama teacher and one of his students was Ellie Kemper
403,Sometimes they can be interesting and you?
404,Oh that is so nice and convenient and free
405,I have no idea, how? DId tou know Patrick Stewart teaches masters classes in drama in the UK?
406,Heck yeah but not lately since the season is over. I only watch American football though.
407,Yeah but more NFL. I do like college once in a while though. The highest score ever in a football game occurred between Georgia Tech and Cumberland. It was 222 to 0.
408,Yeah seriously. Well I don't think would have been in modern times because this occurred back in 1916.
409,Iowa State right? Is it true about their locker room?
410,Oh that's right! Wow that is funny and very dramatic? Do you like the drama genre?
411,Oh interesting. House is awesome because of Hugh Laurie. Makes sense he makes 700,000 per episode.
412,Yes no doubt about that. He is the highest paid actor for any tv drama!
413,My favorite QB is Baker Mayfield. So glad he didn't go pro in video gaming!
414,I would like to see that match up! Kellan Moore is the only left handed QB in the NFL!
415,Oh yeah I forgot about him. Alex Smith is good too which is no surprise that he is very smart! Nice talking with you as well.
416,the game has caused a lot of injury. it is hard to know who is at fault. there are risks. its obvious.
417,they might not have know exactly but they feared the possibility. too much money at stake to stop the game. too much liability to admit fault.
418,yes, then the whole thing could be co-ed. i wish the players had better representation in college. no one helps them.
419,sports are important but most do not involve such risk of injury. basketball soccer baseball tennis swimming the list is endless. plenty of ways to compete. youre wise to protect your kids.
420,thats good. still, the country is dedicated to gridiron gladiators. 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums belong to american college football teams.
421,The high school football stadium in allen, texas seats 18,000 and cost $60 million to build. i guess the pros have similar stadiums. all for 11 minutes of gameplay. i wonder if schools will ever get money like that.
422,true, plus they dont know how to manage money. no control no financial knowledge. i figure they should get help from the league.
423,yes, you would need financial education then if you were a player. why was literature in the olympics?
424,It was a dark and stormy night. suddenly a shot rang out. good stuff! i figure i could be good at being terrible.
425,Comedic fantasy author terry pratchett was knighted for his "services to literature". i wonder what kind of horrible opening lines he could come up with. Anyway, great chat!
426,I love watching it!  How about you?
427,I would have to say out of the 42 teams in the NFL the Steelers are my favorite.
428,I have!  I like how they painted their visitors locker room pink.  lol
429,I could see that.  In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars of the day!  Times have sure changed since then.
430,I be it's reveresed!  Do you know what the higest score ever was in a football game?  Hint it was in 1916 and Georgia Tech beat Cumberland.
431,It was actually 222-0.  What a blowout.
432,lol Did you know that ESPN won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow first down line on tv?  I had no idea.
433,lol Nice!  How about former Patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis?  He's never fumbled the ball once during his career!
434,I agree!  What do you think of the tracking chips that they are putting in the players shoulder pads and footballs to track data?
435,That's probably due to their longer careers.  Did you know that the NFL only has 11 minutes of live gameplay?  I had fun!  Thanks!
436,I'm a huge football fan. How about yourself?
437,I'm a New England Patriots fan and huge fan of Tom Brady how about you?
438,No I didn't know this. Did you know that in the 60's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football players?
439,Now there is no contest football players make way more than bowlers that's for sure. What do you think about the new rule that was implemented by the NFL?
440,Its the rule that a player can't lower his helmet and initiate contact with an opposing player.
441,I think it will decrease injuries and I think its a great rule because it protects the football players from serious head injuries.
442,I didn't know this but its an interesting fact. What year did the NFL and the AFL merge?
443,The merger between the two leagues was completed in 1970. I'm not sure if Donald Trump was an owner of an AFL team.
444,I loved benjarvus green elis and I read somewhere that he never fumbled in his career.
445,It was awesome chatting with you as well. You have a nice day!!!
446,Is that a fact?
447,Fake news!
448,Haha - just as telephone, or phone, is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be heard directly, those two rags can perpetrate nonsense. Right?
449,I'm looking forward to the conclusion!
450,I like the rhyme! Did you know the that the last us president to speak a foreign language fluently was fdr?
451,Oh sure and everyone thinks Trump is illegitimate president because he didn't get the popular vote but 5 presidents have been elected while still losing the popular vote. greatest margin 10%!
452,Well sure and I would've like it to be Bill Murray because he DID voice the human torch in the 1970's fantastic four radio show.
453,Egad - he's not my favorite!
454,Is your grandfather MacGyver?
455,WOW! Cool like the fact that one of the most popular radio acts of the 1930s was a ventriloquist, a fact which baffled contemporary critics.
456,Like old ones or present day?
457,Merry Christmas? Let's finish this thing so that I can go check them out!
458,indeed!
459,For sure.  Did you watch the State of the Union last night delivered by President Trump?  Surprisingly he is not one of the three wealthiest presidents in American history.
460,Possibly.  JFK, Jefferson, and Washington certainly had more.  They are the three wealthiest presidents in history.
461,Did you know until 1805 the runner up in the election became vice president.  Can you imagine Trump working with Hillary?
462,Not sure, good question.  I know it's larger than the white house which is ironic.
463,Right, because NYC's area code is 212.  I get it.
464,That's amazing.  And all of that computing power dependent on a 2.7 ich cable laying across the ocean floor.
465,Most likely.  Hard to hack a razor blade I suppose.  I bet those soldiers were strong, but not strong enough to separate two phone books joined together with overlapped pages.
466,Yeah, that does sound impressive.  I wonder if she ever listened to one of the thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas online.
467,Kinda like Canadians prefer Canadian radio.  They require at least 40% of the music played to be Canadian.
468,Either that or he wasn't very good.
469,That's for sure.  Well, pleasure chatting with you.
470,I'm doing well, you listen to the radio very much?
471,Me too, I'm surprised that Jupiter has radio storms they can be heard on AM radio.
472,I wonder what they sound like? What if it is actually aliens trying to talk with us?
473,For sure, did you see in Canada, 40% of the songs played have to be Canadian? That's pretty wild.
474,I'm sure this will blow you away too, in WW2, soldiers made simple radios using a razorblade and a pencil.
475,Yah, I'm sure there is a youtube video or too on it. You ever heard of the reason why NYCs area code is 2-1-2?
476,It's because it's the fastest number to dial on the rotary, think about how much time you have saved because of it.
477,Yah, did you know the other word for telephone is a phone?
478,Do you see UNICEF donating a day of clean water to a child in need, all you need to do is not use your phone.
479,For sure, I wonder how many people do that? Any idea on why you can't separate two phonebooks that have their pages over lapped?
480,What a mystery. Anyways, great chatting with you, hope you have a good rest of the day, I'm going to go for a walk!
481,Yes, I love to read those romantic novels as well though I haven't done much reading lately ever since football season started and now basketball. Any favorites in particular?
482,Oh Ok, I'm not too familiar with her work, I'll have to look it up after the chat. I do follow a couple of sports authors and read an opinion piece on why the author thinks the University of Iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is painted pink.
483,I like books by Michael Lewis and Ellie Kennedy but recently there's been more debate about the dangers of football on head injuries. Those articles are really convincing, how do you feel about football?
484,Haha, I feel the same way! It's because they need to play ads so as to beat the average lifetime earnings of engineers because supposedly their earnings are higher than the average lifetime earnings of NFL players which I find hard to believe.
485,Yeah, I should've done that too and if my kids ever wanted to be professional cheerleaders, I would be very opposed to it especially since the Saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as the NFL players. They're humans too!
486,Yeah or gender bias too! Not sure, I didn't read about that in the news, at least not anytime recently, I'm surprised there's no MeToo campaign surround that rule!
487,Good point, but there's something wrong with that rule. Yeah, but even if females can play, I'd imagine some would have a difficult time meeting the leagues physical eligibility requirements, I'm not sure what that is, do you know?
488,Yeah, women can be aggressive and strategize as well! They even use tracking chips to monitor and record the players move on the field, I would love to see the data on that.
489,Haha, that would be cool to track, like how fast a quarterback can throw a ball or the force at which someone tackles. I wonder if the player's contracts for salary are adjusted because they're either one of the fastest players or something.
490,Oh that's a good point. Besides football, I also like to watch comedies and find bromantic comedies to be especially popular and funny.
491,Haha yeah! I have never had any White Castle before, though I would love to try some time after seeing their love for the burgers.
492,I know about jefferson and wasington? WHo else is in there?
493,Oh wow, I guess they had a lot of money back then. did you know the guest house is larger than the white house?
494,yeah I wonder if that means something else in their language though
495,yeah that guy honestly, a president and a pop star. wonder fi they are good
496,hahahha that would have been funny. did you know the white house has twin buildings in ireland and france?
497,I have no idea. and do the presidents of those countries like there too?
498,I heard he also banned christmas trees from the white house
499,pretty amazing. did you know they still use floppy discs at the white house?
500,yes I like that. do you watch football?
501,yeah that is actually pretty amazing, good for him. did you know espn won and emmy?
502,Yeah, that is it. nice chat
503,Sure do.    I even play fantasy football.
504,It is certainly possible to make money.     Mostly it is a way to create interest in players on teams you do not root for such as Lamar Jackson.
505,I know a lot about some players like Baker Mayfield on the Browns, but am not an expert.
506,Baker Mayfield is good.    I do not know of his video game habits.     Do you follow the real NFL?
507,The Super Bowl is usually held the first Sunday in February.
508,There is always some interest in the champions of the NFC and AFC playing each other.
509,I am not allowed to gamble because I work for a company that makes tracking chips in shoulder pads!
510,I would guess so, although players don't wear shoulder pads to restaurants.     Maybe ask Matt Patricia, who is both a coach and a rocket scientist.
511,True.      A big change from the first nfl playoff game in 1932!
512,Thanks!   I think I will go read up on the 32 teams in the NFL.
513,No problem.     RPI is a cool university!
514,I am good, thanks. I'm wondering if you are a football fan like me? I know a lot of people are sad the season is over, especially since fantasy football is such a hit.
515,What is the SB? I know if fantasy football it's all about the picks and people plan for weeks.
516,Oh, duh, sorry. The goal is to draft the best team by picking members from all teams to make the best.  Did you know bowlers in the 1960's made more than NFL players?
517,Yes! I used to bowl myself on a league. I am  more of a football fan. I know former Patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis never had a fumble in his career!
518,I think just raw talent. It's hard to say if he got a bonus since the NFL has a total of 32 teams. It's hard to keep up.
519,Actually, the NFL has no rules against women playing as long as they meet the league's eligibility requirements!
520,I would say. I would not want to see a man v woman contact.
521,I am not sure I could watch! Although the average game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay.
522,Yeah, no kidding. Although the average lifetime salary of engineers is higher than the average lifetime earning of an NFL player.
523,Yeah, no kidding! I know the cheerleaders on the Saints have to leave a restaurant if a team player is there.
524,Great chatting with you too!
525,Take care!
526,A little bit, yourself?
527,i wonder if it's to intimidate the other team?
528,The opposite of what they want! Did you see where there was once a football game score of 222-0?
529,Georgia tech V cumberland!
530,no, I think it was back in the day! Espn won an emmy for that superimposed line they use though.
531,no! Who was that?
532,Wow! did you hear the NFL finally drafted a woman since there is no rule against it?
533,I don't. but I bet if you google you will find her! I wonder if they will use those chips in her uniform to see how she does?
534,I wonder if it would get watched? did you know a game generally only has 11 minutes of live play?
535,not really, I like the New orleans Saints. How bout you?
536,What Rule? Great chatting with you!
537,I am.  I used to watch NFL Sunday all the time.  I don't anymore though.  How about you?
538,That's really impressive.  I find it more interesting that an average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.  It's still fun to watch
539,I believe that. The fans want action all of the time.  Watching defensive play after defensive play can get annoying.  Also, you want point grabbers on your fantasy team too.  Defense doesn't always help you win.
540,That's a great way to mess with the visiting team!  Do you play fantasy football?
541,I used to.  I actually used to love playing fantasy Hockey.  I was much better at that.   I never knew that ESPN won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line!  I didn't think you could win an emmy for that.
542,I can see that.  I didn't know it actually existed though.  It's like in Vegas - you can bet on anything
543,That is really interesting.  Almost as interesting as the fact that the Saints' cheerleaders cannot eat in the same restaurant as any NFL player
544,Probably.  I guess it's written into their contract.
545,That's true.  But it seems everyone else has to change their ways for them.
546,It absolutely does.
547,Same to you!  Happy Holidays!
548,I do, I even play a fantasy football game, what about you?
549,I dont really know that but I do know a bit about players QB Macus Mariona is a bad choice, one of the worst QBs in the season
550,Yeah only 13 TD passes which is low for a QB, he did have a better season the previous year
551,Im not aware of that player in what position does he play?
552,Oh I see, he must be a great choice then so fantasy football, people seem to love fantasy leagues not only sports but just about anything
553,No idea either it does sound kind of boring theres even a fantasy congress league
554,Sounds  also really boring, who knows it might be interesting, so do you also like fantasy novels?
555,I do like them, interesting fact but a janitor wrote over 15,145 pages of fantasy but never published his work
556,Maybe he didnt think his book had potential or was waiting to finish it, he died and then the piece of literature got discovered so its hard to tell now
557,Thats interesting I didnt know that, our brain is sure full with mysteries
558,Yeah, its also been great chatting with you, thanks for the chat.
559,I do from time to time.
560,That's cool.  Do you watch the NFL at all?
561,I like the Cardinals and 49ers.
562,I know! Do you follow the odds for each team winning at all"
563,It is part of how the betting on each team is handled.  There is an over/under on each team winning.
564,I think he was a running back.  You are correct about my teams winning it all.  The Vikings do not appear to be doing to well either.
565,LOL!  It seems when the Vikings play the Packers one should pick the Packers.  What do you think?
566,I doubt it. I would say the Packers are favored over the Vikings.  I would not bet against Rogers.
567,LOL!  Did you know that one of the most expensive high school football stadiums was built in Allen,TX?
568,It was $60 million.  I know that is a ton of money!  Did you also know that Snoop Dogg wrote a fight song for his son's football team?
569,I do watch the NFL. I watch the Super Bowl. What about you?
570,Wow that's crazy. I don't know if that's worth it any but it is certainly useful. I do like the Patriots and I guess that they have a running back was never fumbled the ball. They should give him the ball every time. Or at least I would haha
571,Well like you said the Super Bowl was really boring this year so that kind of does not surprise me haha another boring game would be the highest scoring football game ever. It was 222 to 0 haha
572,That actually scared me. I'm sure they get a lot of great stats that they can use like the rotation of the ball. But I just hope that they keep it in the game and they don't put it on actual citizens like you or me
573,But it's both honestly. What are your thoughts on the New Orleans Saints cheerleaders being forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as an NFL player?
574,Oh I didn't know that. It seems very outdated but I guess they might have a reason for it. Do you know any Engineers that you're friends with?
575,Oh that's awesome. And yep that is what I have heard did you know that the NFL has no rule against female players. Do you think we'll see one in our lifetime?
576,That's a good point that I never thought about. What is also interesting to me is that an NFL game only has about 10 or 11 minutes to it that seems super low.
577,Yep I agree with that. Do you watch any fantasy movies. Or do you do fantasy football at all
578,I never played fantasy football but I did hear that they have fantasy National Spelling Bee and also fantasy Congress that seems so stupid haha
579,I do watch some once in a while, you?
580,I know some of the basics, but I also know that there is really only 11 minutes of active game play.  Crazy seeing how long the games are.
581,They might, or just make it so they wont want to play.  I mean I think anyone who is good enough should be eligible to play.  But I can imagine many women who would want to go up against 300 pound linemen
582,I would agree.  They even have chips in shoulderpads to record moves of players and with that they can see how hard they get hit.
583,Yeah, with that do you think it could also help determine reviews?  Like use that data to say where the ball was or wasnt at any given point.
584,The yellow line sure helped things develop in terms of home viewership, so much so that ESPN won an Emmy for it
585,Did you know that the highest scoring and biggest spread was in a game in 1916?
586,222-0.  I dont even see how that is possible.  That one team must have been really bad.
587,Ive seen some blow outs, but never by that much.
588,I never have, but my brother gets seriously into it.
589,Smart move, no law suits that would be obvious and easy to pursue.
590,I just say something about girl who is trying to turn pro. Its seems a stretch, maybe as a kicker or punter.
591,I just watch a few games here and there. Not so excited to see a bunch of millionaires play a game. How about you?
592,That is such a wierd rule. I wonder what the reason is? No hanky panky?
593,Not sure an engineer makes more than an NFL player.
594,Its funny that they have chips in the players sholder pads.
595,Do you do any fantasy football?
596,They were actually betting on how many times they would say gronk in the super bowl. Maybe not a fanatasy league but a wierd sports related fact.
597,I don't just don't have the passion for it, you?
598,I have not read about Terry Prachett, whats up with him?
599,I am not sure about that some people who have been knighted are real losers in my book.
600,I do not normally play but he is making a comeback in the FF circles
601,He did well at Penn State as a junior so hopefully he will be able to keep that up in the NFL
602,I like the NFL a lot - it is curious that in the 60's bowlers made more money than NFL players!
603,222-0!  I would have left after the first quarter!
604,Yes and back in 1916 there was not even our magical yellow line
605,I love how my school Iowa paints the visiting team's locker room pink just to screw with the other team
606,Yes he is amazingly good.  The NFL only has 11 minutes of live gameplay so that is not that much time per game
607,Yes as a kid I always wanted to play in the NFL or the MLB but being a tiny girl never quite made the team!   Luckily my career as an engineer will pay me more over the long run
608,Oh for sure.  That is very rude!  They would never allow a female player.  I do like what the NFL is doing with tracking chips however.
609,Yes did you watch the Super Bowl on the first sunday in February?  It was rather boring this year
610,Hi! If I had to take a guess, I'd say Lincoln, Roosevelt, and Kennedy. Am I close?
611,I was semi close! What made them as wealthy as they did?
612,I wonder if they lost their monetary value of slaves when they freed the slaves. That's kind of crazy to think about that people were like possessions that could be transacted! Now, it's just cars, homes, etc. Did you know it is illegal to warm up your car in Ohio?
613,Oh that's super close to Ohio, I made a trip with a friend once from Ohio to Michigan. Yeah, a remote car starter would be useful especially when you guys were affected by the polar vortex! It could be possible because Audi adjusted their car horn sound to accomodate the Indian market and its heavy usage.
614,What? That's crazy! Maybe that's what students need in order to learn about history.
615,Lol! Seeing that Kanye seems pretty wild in his actions, you never know. At least he and Trump would get away with it by calling it "art"
616,Lol and you should be the producer or marketing director! I'm not sure whether or not I would change the radio station if I heard it over the radio though but Bing Crosby recordings filled more than half of the radio time in 1948.
617,Lol! I've heard of that country but didn't know that that's what they called their president.
618,Seriously! Do you know whether or not the people of Zimbabwe vote for their president via the popular vote or they have a electoral college? 5 presidents in the US have actually been elected even though they lost the popular vote!
619,No way! Really? Who stays in the guest house? Would family members or close relatives stay there? In Guatemala, close relatives of former presidents can't legally run for president.
620,I do, I actually like to listen to radio dramas, theres a very good site with thousands of free episodes
621,Yeah, that would be it, drama podcasts but in a radio show format, there is also a radio station that broadcasts news in latin!! interesting or boring?
622,Thats lunatic!! can you imagine cars in America with flame throwers? we would be in deep trouble for sure, I wonder why they allow that over there
623,I do use them I think they are a great invention and I guess we owe soldiers a lot, I couldnt imagine my life without a drive-thru service, they are just life saves
624,I see, so thats were the Cadilac name comes from, you know the first car was a Benz
625,The first car ever to be made, the year was 1986 many people think it was a Ford but no,
626,I used to play it as a kid, if i knew I could have become a pro driver just from playing it I would have practiced a lot more lol
627,3 pop albums while in office!!  I guess he had a lot of free time, I would be worried as a citizen of Indonesia
628,I would be worried because an album takes a lot of time so instead of doing his job his recording songs probably with the tax dollars of citizens, they are expensive as well.
629,Thats funny, how can you be called Banana!!! you know that before 1905 the runner up of an election in the US would become the vice president
630,yeah, I dont watch basketball at all. I used to watch football before all of the kneeling and protesting. Now my Sundays are mine again.
631,I don't agree with the protesting. Players should protest or be active on their own time.
632,The NFL has given in to the PC culture and thought police in the US.
633,I was a huge fan. I didnt even watch the superbowl this year. Another patriots win....yawn....I mean yay
634,I don't watch a lot of tv either, we can run through some of this Tv trivia though. There are over 750 episodes of pokemon. That's about 50 a year for 16 years.
635,yeah, that show was ok, kinda funny from what I remember. Hard to believe only 1 episode of the simpsons without bart, mentioned or appearing.
636,ahh yeah, I did binge through the game of thrones series. Do you know when the series will be released?
637,perfect! Looking forward to it returning.
638,yeah, should be good. will be interesting to see.
639,you too!
640,Hi, how are you today? Sometimes I watch football.
641,Yeah, I heard that. I guess it's hard for teams to adjust around a lefty.
642,I see so many lefties in the MLB, I figure it would be the same in the NFL. I am surprised by the origins of the huddle.
643,Clever. It's such a fundamental part of the game now. Do you listen to the radio much?
644,I bet Jupiter is better than most top 40 these days.
645,I think the law is there to protect Canadian artists in their home market. Everybody is a Rush fan as a result.
646,He was a terrible hockey player, so he took up music.  Would you listen to a news broadcast in Latin?
647,Why is this a thing in Finland? A news program in Latin? Some rich weirdo must pay for it, or there are a ton of volunteers.
648,I guess he had a following. I bet Trump would release albums.
649,I have no idea. He probably made a law that people had to buy them. Trump would probably record with Kanye.
650,I am not sure, is he the person that launched the podcast after leaving team 980?
651,Ah, do you listen to the radio a lot?
652,I only listen to the radio while I am on the car.
653,Wow!  There is also a website where you can listen to thousands upon thousands of classical radio dramas. All for free!
654,Canadian radios also have to play 40% canadian music.
655,I guess, although I do not think that they need that rule. A lot of artists that I listen to are already Canadian and I think that they make excellent music.
656,Really? Wow. The average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live action. I wonder why so many people still enjoy it.
657,I agree. Thank you for your time! It was nice chatting with you.
658,The tracking chip in the football are responsible for keeping track of its rotations and velocity.
659,That is a very unfair rule, I wonder why it even exists. Do they have something against cheerleaders?
660,Yeah. Anyways, thank you for your time! It was nice chatting with you!
661,I do like Football.  Do you?  I've heard that it's been a category on Jeopardy before!
662,It could be hard.  I'm not sure I could get ones where they ask about specific plays.
663,He is pretty good. I mean, Aaron Rodgers considers him the greatest of all time of game show hosts.
664,Wow! That must mean a lot of commercials and penalties go on during a game!  Football has been around a long time though. The first playoff was in 1932.
665,I guess that means that Matt Patricia likes the game then more than money considering he was an aeronautical engineer before becoming a coach.
666,That is so bizarre to think that bowlers make more than football players!  Especially with the Superbowl coming up on the first Sunday in February!
667,I have to admit I do like watching the best of the nfc and afc compete against each other!  Speaking of animals, did you know there is a lawyer in Switzerland that represents them in court?
668,I bet he does at that!  I wonder if he would need a translator for some.  Some animals from distant areas speak different dialects or languages.
669,That is interesting!  Have you heard about the netherlands building natural bridges for wildlife so they won't get hit by cars on the roads?
670,It is a great thing they did! i wish the U.S. would do that!
671,They do indeed.  I like that they have their own scientific kingdom called Animalia.
672,I'm doing well, thanks!! How about you?
673,No I didn't. Do you happen to know the reason why?
674,Ha Ha!!! Thanks. Do you follow soccer at all these days?
675,Yes I do and in fact I recently read somewhere that D.C. United have a stadium called Audie Field and according to their officials it will welcome more than just MLS matches.
676,It is a game that has been around for a very long time. It is played from what I heard by 250 million players in over 200 countries in the world.
677,I do. I'm a big Liverpool fan but also like Juventus, Barcelona and the New England Revolution.
678,No the teams that I mentioned are in different leagues and in different countries.
679,Each country has a league and from there it gets determined by their position in the rankings if they making to the Champions League in Europe or not.
680,Correct and that is just in Europe!!! Here in the US it works differently. I read somewhere that soccer players run on average 7 miles per game.
681,Wow!!! I didn't know this. I also recently read that the Super Bowl is smaller than soccer's 3rd biggest event.
682,It was my pleasure. I love soccer and I have been watching it since I was a kid. It was great chatting with you today!!!
683,Hello,  no I do not follow the NFL really.  Do you?  I recently learned that snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his sons high school team lol
684,That is pretty crazy considering that the football players are more prone to injuries lol I guess it was good to be a bowler back then!
685,Yeah football players do make a ridiculous amount of money!
686,that is really impressive!  I wonder why that guy isnt more known lol There is a rocket scientist that was a football coach,  Matt Patricia.
687,Yeah.  I bet it was worth it though!
688,I have watched soccer on occassion,  but I do not keep up with it.  Do like soccer?
689,Wow that is amazing!
690,Wow that is awesome!  Good they are making good money,  seems like they get injured a lot also.
691,Yikes,  Id rather not thanks lol I hear soccer players run an average of 7 miles per game!
692,I recently learned that Greenland cant join FIFA because there's not enough grass there lol can't they use fake grass?
693,Great! Hope you're doing well! So do you follow association football aka soccer? Hard to believe it makes more money than golf, tennis, football, basketball, baseball and hockey combined!
694,It's crazy, isn't it? I guess that's why Mesut Ozil donated his entire world cup victory bonus to pay for the surgery of 23 children in Brazil. Must have been pocket change considering!
695,Agreed! Hopefully others follow in his footsteps. So do you follow regular football aka gridiron ball like the NFL? I do and always wondered why there are no females when the NFL has no rules against them joining as long as they meet the requirements!
696,I mean, there's only 11 minutes of live game play anyway. So you'd think at least one or two would have been drafted or picked up by a team, right?
697,Agreed. Maybe they'd rather enter engineering since engineers make more than the average lifetime earnings of an NFL/MLB player. It'd be a much wiser decision, I suppose!
698,No kidding! What's even wilder (or sadder actually) is knowing Saints cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as Saints players and if one walks in after, they have to leave. That is just wrong!
699,Exactly. I wonder what happened! Still that could classify as discrimination in this day and age, I suppose. But is that truly as bad as Georgia Tech once beating a team 222-0? Ha! The highest score ever in the game of football!
700,So true! But when you have players in the league like Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbling the ball, I can see why!
701,Same here. I'd probably fumble as soon as it's handed to me. Ha! Wonder what his mindset would be if he was forced to visit the visitor's lockerroom at Iowa before a game, where the massage pink? Talk about demeaning! That's crazy!
702,Wow! That is shocking! I tell you what surprised me was learning there is actually a soccer variation where 3 teams face each other at the exact same time! It's like, how does that happen?
703,I think Brady is looking for a way to stay relevant and this spirituality through football is a bit ridiculous.
704,If anything I think that the idea of sports tends to make people more divisive. It is crazy how bitter and competitive people get about teams.
705,I wonder if people would be as apt to follow brady if he was losing more than he was winning.
706,I wonder if he is setting it up to have some sort of cult or MLM stuff once he is finally too old play anymore.
707,That sure is suprising considering how male dominated the sport is.
708,I know that it was commonly used as reading curriculum. It was an easily accessible book and quite a challenging read.
709,That does seem like something Iowa would do. They are quite into razzing other players from opposite teams.
710,There is a huge rivalry between the two teams from the main Iowa colleges. Either you are a hawkeye fan or an UN of I fan. They are as bad as packers and vikings fans
711,The rest of the time must be spent on huddles and waiting for the snap. I wonder if other forms of football have more action time.
712,It really does. I wonder if there was more time to the cumberland game where they set the high score record.
713,Cumberland completely whupped Georgia back at the beginning of the century. It was 222-0. I mean at some point you just need to give up.
714,Yes it was a nice chat.
715,I am a football fan, what about you?
716,Yeah, I heard it seems like that is pretty cool.
717,Yeah, you have to wonder if that actually works. I suspect it just makes the other team more angry.
718,I'm not sure, just a wild guess, but was it 222-0?
719,Interesting, is he the best running back ever?
720,Yeah, that is pretty crazy. Did you know an iphone has more computing power than the entire US Nuclear ICBM deterrent.
721,Interesting. Did you know that Jupiter has radio storms that can be heard on AM radio here?
722,I wonder what station it is actually on?
723,No, what does it say?
724,Interesting, I wonder why nobody naturally wants to listen to that? Well, nice chatting with you.
725,Hello, i love the NFL now thats a real sports league!
726,Well, not in the NFL they dont but i'm sure they might have a womans league
727,That would be great but no woman has tried yet
728,Yeah because of the breaks, half times and timeout and calls that the refs make.
729,It all depends on the contract that they negociate but it is usually in the milliopns!
730,No, i usually change the channel during the half time shows haha
731,Yeah, of course but only if i am at the live concert not watching it on tv
732,I believe it! Especially since linkin park played 324 in 2001 alone. Add that by 20 years!
733,That's pretty pathetic if you ask me just get your money back and go home haha
734,Well, obviously everyone else at the concert seemed to enjoy it so not to bad of a deal
735,I haven't checked recently. Hey, i gotta go for now it was nice chatting with you. I hope you have  a great night.
736,Good night
737,yes I know some stuff. Do you know who the wealthiest us presidents are?
738,Right. Did you know the guest house is larger than the white house
739,Yeah. Have you heard the president of Indonesia is a pop star?
740,Right? Do you know how the VP used to be elected?
741,Yeah I think that is actually fair because they work a lot towards that as well
742,I sure do. Did you ever watch the Simpsons?
743,Yeah and the weird part is that he was not even mentioned in it
744,I did and I liked it but I guess it did not really take of in the UK as it got cancelled after 10 episodes
745,True, How about Pokemon?
746,Yeah they have been in the air for about 16 years , so long
747,I am partial to rutherford b hayes. You?
748,THat's a good choice. Did you ever see Lincoln?
749,HAHAHAHA! I meant the movie, Lincoln, with Daniel Day Lewis.
750,It was really good. Got nominated for a bunch of awards. Of course everyone raved about DDL...
751,He is? Wow, I thought it was like JFK... good to know!
752,Wow. That's surprising. It's also surprising knowing that there was a president called President Banana.
753,Yes and yes! Although I could really see president carrot catching on...
754,I feel like our president must be slacking then. They haven't released any! Slackers!
755,The runner up used to become the VP.
756,Can you imagine Hillary and Trump in the same white house!
757,Yeah. It was great chatting with you!
758,I agree, I can't believe China has a 375 billion dollar trade surplus with the US. That's crazy!
759,True, it is always scary dealing with other countries, but we do get a lot from China, and they buy 130 billion dollars worth of goods from us so sounds like we can have a thing if we can keep going with it.
760,Definitely, and we are pretty safe because we are expanding our defense spending if they do try anything, We have several Asian allies so I think if we can all keep the peace will benefit us all.
761,Yes, we really need to stay on high alert at all times and hopefully Trump did sign the bill to produce more military ships from 280 to 326...but no doubt we have to keep on top of them.
762,We definitely do need to stay aware. He is not? Wow, that is surprising! Isn't president Trump a billionaire? I think the wealthiest presidents had a very good side job going lol
763,I would think for sure Trump would be the wealthiest! Maybe Trump could make some pop albums while in office like the president in Indonesia did! haha, that would bring in more money! Then he could have concerts too! haha, pretty crazy huh?
764,Wouldn't it! I wonder if the president ever goes to any Football games or goes to concerts, or rather have them come to him lol....I love concerts and have been to many but not any lately.
765,Oh no! Haha, I heard there was a lawsuit against Creed at some point for the show being so bad! I went to a small venue years ago to one of Creeds concerts and it was fantastic. But he was clean and sober by that time too.
766,Right! But when I saw Scott Stapp he was not Creed anymore it was him doing a solo career, he was pretty high and drunk for many years but he did get better. Speaking of concerts, The Ramones played over 2,200 concerts while touring non stop for 20 years! What a crazy life!
767,I like the Ramones but they are not a favorite. I like a few of their songs. I like Linkin Park a lot but didn't get to see them before Chester passed away.....they played over 300 concerts in 2001 alone, I should have tried to go to one then. I loved them, still do but its not the same.
768,Hi, do you like football?
769,I like them both too, I did not realize that the season lasts 17 weeks
770,They only rest one of the 17 weeks of the season.
771,That is impressive, also you had asked about Aaron Rodgers, he became the highest paid player
772,He has been the most valuable NFL player twice
773,He is very hopeful, he wrote a post on Instagram  were she shows he is very excited and looking forward for amazing memories!
774,That is so neat! I would to see that happen, but I do not think it will anytime soon
775,Probably a good idea, did you know there is only one left handed QB in the NFL?
776,His name is Kellan Moore! Also there have only been two African American QB that have been winners in the superbowl
777,That is a nice beginning of the huddle, who was that QB?
778,That is so cool. Well it was nice talking to you. Have a good one
779,Good.  Hopefully you are doing well too.  ARe you going to watch the NFL playoffs this weekend?  The 17 week schedule is completed.
780,Yup.  Unfortunately my favorite team, the Ravens, were eliminated.  I guess that's what happens in a single elimination tournament.
781,I can't see it.  Maybe a kicker.  And they use tracking chips in pads to record the player's moves.
782,These are supposed to track the player's moves, as well as the ball's velocity and rotation.
783,That's crazy.  did you know that the first nfl playoff game was played in 1932.
784,Yup, it was played on an 80 yard log dirt field.
785,That doesn't surprise me.  Most professional athletes don't play for very long.  Matt Patricia has a nice fall back career.  He is a rocket scientist.
786,He actually graduated  from a school whose fight song includes some trigonometry terms.
787,That's strange for a democracy.  Did you know that there is actually a radio station that translates solar activity into sound?
788,You as well.  I hope you have a nice evening.
789,That's an interesting fact. Do you enjoy football and the nfl?
790,Well the NFL has done a decent job as it is now recognized as among the 4 major sport leagues in North America.
791,It may because they put a lot of dedication into their profession. Did you know that nfl implant chips into player's shoulderpads to record their everymove to use their data for better plays and understanding of football? They even put them in the footballs themselves
792,It is interesting how they are trying to track velocity, rotation, ball speed and location. I wonder how well they have implemented this new data. Regarding your opinion on tracking normal people, I agree.
793,I think that is more a new orlean saints problem than an nfl problem. In fact, the nfl has no written rule against female players
794,Well I think that is because an average NFL player is active for far less than than an average engineer
795,I'm not sure, but those 11 minutes of gameplay sure take their toll, especially since they result in severe injuries
796,Speaking of football, are you familiar with Alex Smith of the Redskins?
797,He is a rookie for the red skins that some feel will lead the new ear of running backs coming around the nfl league
798,I agree he seems to be good all around with no real weakness in his game. From pass game to running the ball, even in protections, he is well versed.
799,not really. I only watch the Superbowl every year.
800,Yes. It was a lot of fun. I was with a big group at my workplace. Someone in the group won a lot of money & he was really happy. I had no idea that they put chips in the players shoulder pads. That is very interesting.
801,I am wondering what the AM radio station is to hear the sounds from Jupiter now!
802,It's very interesting. I think I had heard of "foxhole radios, but I had no idea that they were made out of razorblades & pencils.
803,That is really interesting. I guess that would be the only way to pick up latin or try to listen to it! I really like listening to other radio stations or music/DJ's from around the world.
804,No. I have simple radio. They have an app & you can also listen online.
805,I don't have the pandora app. There are so many music apps to listen to or have now.
806,Yeah. It's really interesting that the circular huddle was created by a deaf quarterback. I'm not a big enough person to have ever played football.
807,Yeah. Also, concussions are a real thing. Maybe there should be some sort of chips in the players helmets as well.
808,I'm surprised there aren't already. You'd think that that would also be as important (if not more important) than tracking the players movements through their shoulder pads!
809,I am a big fan of the NFL - every fall watching the league get whittled from 32 teams to one ultimate winner - its great fun!
810,Yes and was working on a masters when he got drafted!
811,yes but in reality an engineer will make more in his lifetime than a nfl player
812,That is true.  All for only 11 minutes of gameplay a week
813,Exactly.   Now if we could get female players into the game - that would make it more interesting
814,For sure.  But probably not for the Saints - they seem to be pretty anti-women
815,Yes cheerleaders should be able to continue eating in a restaurant when players come in
816,That would make more sense!  I bet they want the tracking chips they use in the game used all the time
817,Yes it does seem really helpful - I could see it working well in soccer
818,That is strange considering how many lefty pitchers there are in baseball
819,Oh yes, I love Ronaldo and Messi ! Can't seem to have enough of them ! ;)
820,Naah, I didn't - who were You cheering for ?
821,Yeah - thumbs were very important in our evolution :) lol, hey how can one (quarterback ) make the touchdown pass to himself ? I mean... how ?
822,Do You think it's a good idea ? Are they physically ready ?
823,I guess You're not looking for an actual conversation here, just copying the subjects from the article... are You not afraid they will reject our work ?
824,I asked You if You think women are ready for that game ? like physically ? I guess You've missed that question...
825,With all the money invested in that game, do You think they would risk to out women into the field ? I mean can they be as strong or fast ?
826,Like I said - I wonder what the investors would say if they would see woman in a team they invested millions of dollars...
827,Engineer ? Really ? I saw some numbers how much NFL players earn... little hard for me to believe in that...
828,I guess You're right... Mr. Kapernick  better start training to be an Engineer ;)
829,He seems like a nice guy. He's had a long and pretty good career until recently.
830,Oh wow! I did not hear about that. Has he been charged?
831,Yeah they certainly fell off in their performance in the last few years. Do you enjoy football?
832,I have not heard of him. Hopefully he can bring the team back to where they used to be.
833,Hopefully it was just one mistake and not representative of his character. Speaking of QB's, are you familiar with Alex Smith?
834,Yes he did. He was actually working on his master's when he was drafted. That's very impressive.
835,Oh wow! You would think there would be more but when I think about it I don't remember seeing a QB throw with his left hand.
836,I would think it would be very difficult to be a deaf QB. You couldn't hear play changes or calls in your helmet and you'd think you'd get sacked more.
837,I did not. I had no idea you could make a radio with so little.
838,I agree. I see no reason even with the size difference why they could not play.
839,Yes I do. DId you hear they are placing chips on the players now?
840,Yes during the games to track velocity and rotation and such
841,Me too. Did you know Matt Patricia is an astronaut turned coach?
842,Yeah it is. do you know when the first NFL game was played?
843,Wow that is it? The first game was played in 1932
844,I like him yes. Did you know Kellan Moore is the only left handed QB
845,wow they wasted a good chance to win some games there
846,Wow that is super fast, how did he manage that?
847,wow amazing. Brad Johnson is the only QB that threw himself a touchdown pass
848,I know right? Do you listen to the radio much?
849,I sure do , did you know women can play too?
850,Yes. Did you know there is only 11 minutes of game play in a game?
851,Yeah I know. Engineers make more money than NFL players over the lifetime
852,Yeah that is actually a good point, it makes much more sense
853,Yes them not being able to eat in the same restaurant as the players
854,Yes it is sexist and it really needs to go
855,Yes they are tracking velocity and speed and all that stuff
856,I hope so too. Do you like rap music?
857,Yes me too. Tupac's music is in the library of congress for cultural significance
858,Yes he seems to really like spiderman of all the superheroes
859,Sorry, I can't say that I do,I'm familiar with the big stories , but that is it.
860,I used to live in DC son kind of know the Redskins, but Alex Smith is new to me, is he the quarterback?
861,Now that is impressive, you have this impression of sports players as jocks, but he transcends that stereotype.
862,Do you go to football games?  I've been to one once in my life at Indiana University.
863,I think that is what puts me off, I really don't have time to sit in front of the TV for three hours, and then for only 11 minutes of play.
864,I guess some people listen to games on the radio, difficult to see how that works.
865,Do you have a favorite NFL team.  Like I said, I lived in DC for a while so kind of follow them.  Now in northern Ohio, the Browns are a difficult team to support.
866,It could be worse, I read about this team that lost 220-0.  It would be hard to watch to the end.
867,They probably have some plaque in the locker room to commemorate it.  I  hear one team paints the opponents locker room pink, seems a little childish to me.
868,The money these pro players get now is huge,  funny to think pro bowlers made more than footballers back in the sixties.
869,Probably not much for either of them.
870,Nice chatting with you, have a good evening.
871,That is weird. Do you happen to know why that is?
872,Ha! That could be it. They probably did to throw the visiting team off their game. That makes perfect sense.
873,Wow!! I didn't know this but I bet that is not the case these days, football players make way more than bowlers now, right?
874,That is very nice. I think this Emmy was well deserved because people could see where the actual first down was because before it was a guessing game.
875,Wow!!! Who did they beat up that badly, do you know?
876,That is too bad for them, I guess Cumberland just made an appearance to the field that particular day. Ha Ha!!!
877,That is a very interesting. Thanks. Did you know that radio systems need an antenna to convert electric currents into radio waves?
878,Thanks. Do you happen to know the name of the website that does this?
879,Wow!!! I guess they were very creative in making radios to communicate with each other.
880,I didn't know this. Thanks. Did you know that a radio receiver receives its input from an antenna and then it converts it into a form that is usable for the consumer?
881,Well I love pro ball, not so interested in college, it's too emotional from players.
882,I believe that. Football was just beginning to become popular. If the two leagues hadn't consolidated it might have remained at that level.
883,Must have not had a defensive coordinator back then. You have a favorite team?
884,I have had several different teams through the years. I was an avid Raiders fan until they moved to LA, now I root for the Seahawks since I'm from Wa.
885,I wonder if being left-handed is an asset or a hinderance. I think that Kenny Stabler was also a leftie but that was long ago.
886,I had heard that. I wonder how he handled the snaps? Maybe just touched the center. How about Alex Smith, not only a great QB but also very smart.
887,Amazing man. Did you play FB in school? I was raised in Fairbanks Ak and the snow didn't totally disappear until @ May 1st, school let out mid May so it would have been a very short season.
888,Hope he finishes it. While it might not pay as much, education is the best thing you can have.
889,One of my sons wanted to be a game coder but he ended up being an IT specialist. You have a pick for the super bowl yet?
890,Neither have I. If a game requires quick reflexes I'm lost. I do alright in strategy games where I can take my time to think before I do anything.
891,Definitely yes.  I am a huge Eagles fan, Go Birds!
892,I like Wentz but Foles has the magic right now
893,Yes I agree especially for Clay Matthews
894,I live in DC and Josh Norman is disliked, it's a common opinion that all he does is talk and not play well
895,I only support the Eagles, just the Redskins are the local team so we get a ton of news about them daily.  Its kind of like a circus LOL
896,LOL yes I have heard about that.  Do you follow an NFL team?
897,Do you listen to alot of radio?
898,Yes I read that, kind of interesting
899,Yes that is amazing, was also shocked when I read that
900,I know its crazy, I wonder if it was one of those I have an idea moments
901,I do, I follow it pretty closely, what about you?
902,Not a patriots fan, but yeah, the superbowl was super boring this year.
903,Yeah, that could be a big part of it. They do always seem to be standing around.
904,I don't know if people want to see female players.
905,yeah, a lot of teams actually have that rule. The redskins do too, I know because I have a few friends who cheered for them a few years back.
906,They don't get paid well and it is a lot of work. The rule is actually no fraternizing, but Chris Cooley (a player) at the time ended up marrying one and it created a big stink for the other cheerleaders. LOL
907,I think it is hilarious that they do that to guest teams, but I'm not so sure it bothers the other teams.
908,I wonder how popular bowling was way back in the day.
909,They deserve the emmy for that. It is pretty cool. I wonder if any football players became bowlers in the 60s?
910,I heard that dogs and elephants are the only animals that instinctively understand pointing.
911,are you a pokemon fan? i have never seen the show. i figure its for kids. is it?
912,isnt that show japanese or something?
913,why would they do something so stupid as that? verbatim? like that would fool anyone.
914,have you ever used a rotary phone? very slow. the new yorkers got lucky.
915,it is a useless fact except maybe for a bar bet. i guess you could win a drink. i used a rotary phone too.
916,i think that it is probably pretty sturdy. plus it is way down on the bottom of the sea. nothing lives there except maybe tiny creatures.
917,no i dont. coincidentally i do have an ICBM deterrent.
918,too expensive. the icbm deterrent has text messaging, which is good enough for me.
919,raising awareness i guess. its not just the problem and the solution but getting people to think about others around the planet. and how much time they spend on those phones.
920,yeah,i guess those all the time. irritating. anyway, great chat!
921,I do. DId you know women can play too?
922,Yeah. THe game only lasts for 11 minutes, active game at least
923,Yes but they also have longer careers than the football players
924,Yes they cannot eat in the same place as the players
925,Yes it is absurd and sexist and it needs to go
926,Yes they are collecting stuff like velocity and rotation and such
927,Some stuff. DO you know who the three wealthiest ones in the US are?
928,Yeah. Do you know what the first president of Zimbabwe was called?
929,Yes. Did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house?
930,Yes the runner up. DO you use facebook?
931,Yesh for $75 million they could have made billions now
932,Watching the Eagles now!  Hope they win:)  If they win with a score of 223 or higher, they'll beat the record for the highest scoring football game over the old record of Georgia Tech in 1916
933,That is crazy.  Do you ever see the yellow line?  ESPN Created it
934,Do you like baseball?  A married couple scheduled all the games up until 2005.  In fact they scheduled 2430 games.
935,Sure is!  If you like to watch football as a couple, then you really only need 11 minutes to watch live gameplay.  But, you probably spend a few hours.
936,Yep that's exactly what I said.  Did you hear about the man who found lots of 1900's baseball cards in his grandfathers attic?  They were hidden since 1940's.  Do you know how much they were worth?
937,$3 million in fact.  That's a lot of cash!  If you are a cheerleader for the New Orleans Saints, you have to leave a restaurant if an NFL player comes in after you.  That stinks.
938,They should get reimbursed by the NFL for the meal then or have the NFL player pay for it.
939,There is no rule against it.  I never thought they couldn't.  I just didn't think anyone made it that far that was female.  Probably there have been more than a share of obstacles to get there.  Nice thing is that if you are an engineer, chances are you will make more average lifetime earnings than that of the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player or mlb player
940,It is a very dangerous sport.  Did you hear Tim Tebow switched from the NFL to MLB but didn't fare so well getting moved to the Mets' minor leagues
941,Tebow had been a Heisman Trophy Winner in the NFL, so he did have a lot of prior success in the majors.
942,The issue has been around several decades.
943,Native Americans do not take that in negative.
944,Cleveland decision should finally compel the washington football team to make honorable decision.
945,Its need very hardwork and pratice.  Make the nation pride.
946,They are have equal oppourtunity. We are living in the 21st century.
947,Yes, to prevent fraternization.  It's better to avoid cheerleaders.
948,Cheerleaders seem to distract players. It's best to avoid it
949,I think it's best not to have players distracted.
950,Sorry, in the twentieth century, there were several various kinds of football which grew to most popular team.
951,Yes, Baseball is so popular in Japan also many fans are surprised to discover its status as America's national pastime.
952,Good.  Thanks for asking.  Did you watch the Superbowl this past weekend?  It was on the first Sunday in February  right on schedule.
953,Yup, but wasn't very impressed with the game or the commercials.  The spectacle was good though.  The NFL has come a long way since playing it's first game in 1932 on an 80 yard long dirt field.
954,They sure stepped away from Papa Johns though.  Between him using the n word and saying that protesting NFL players were hurting his business, they had enough of him.
955,I know.  He founded that company 30 years ago, and just like that he's out.  Way to really screw things up...
956,They'll probably ride it out.  What he said was horrible and inappropriate.
957,Agreed.  Can't dispute that at all.  I believe he is still owns a substantial portion of the company and will stand to profit when the company and its stock price rebound.  I wonder if he bought more stock when the price crashed.
958,I supposed greed get in the way.  They start out with noble intentions, and inevitably blow it.  And the bigger the company gets, the more lives they impact when their franchise owners and workers have to feel the repercussions as well.  They are left to look at his face that was still on all of their pizza boxes.
959,I do enjoy football.  My favorite team is the Ravens.
960,Assuming he can get his timing down, arm strength is fine.  You guys have a pretty nice QB yourselves.  I'd take him in a heartbeat.  I wonder what those tracking chips embedded in the player's shoulder pads show when he takes off and runs.
961,Yup, same with Lamar Jackson.  Of course, we have RG3 too, so there's that...  Now all we need is one of those $50,000 1,100 pound American Flags to unfurl before every home game.
962,I'm doing well thanks I love sports! I like football a lot. American football that is.
963,Yeah I love watching the Super Bowl. As is tradition it was held in the first Sunday in February.
964,Yeah you didn't miss much this year. I wish an AFC team didn't win this year. I don't like the patriots.
965,Yes me as well. The first NFL playoff game was played in 1932 on an 80 yard long dirt field inside Chicago stadium.
966,Yes true. There was actually a rocket scientist who coached in the NFL before. Matt Patricia!
967,Yes very true. I also like baseball too. And a typical major league baseball season a total of 160,000 baseballs are used.
968,Yeah that is a lot of games. The Chicago cubs were the first baseball team to win back to back World Series. Pretty cool!
969,Not sure if it is a curse but it definitely could be. A rule that I have never heard of is that if a player catches a baseball in their hat the opposing team receives three bases.
970,Yes I need to look it up to. The minor-league baseball team in Albuquerque was named after the baseball team in the Simpsons LOL.
971,Ha ha yeah definitely. Well high school football is definitely more popular than high school baseball because there's a $60 million high school football stadium in Texas.
972,Great chatting with you too I hope you have a pleasant afternoon.
973,I'm not really that into football. Maybe it's because there are only about 11 minutes of live gameplay per game.
974,Haha. I wonder if anything will change for the Raiders when they move to Vegas. I'm kind of sad to see them go since I'm from that area,though I cannot say I'm a fan.
975,It seems like it's still unclear as to where the Raiders will play in 2019
976,Yeah, it really is a complicated matter. The city is expected to file an antitrust lawsuit over the Raiders' move to Las Vegas.
977,The Chronicle thinks it will happen. However, the Raiders probably do not hold a great hand.
978,Yeah there are a bunch of reasons why it can't be in the Bay Area or Las Vegas so we shall see.
979,I just like teams from the bay area, haha. That would be the Raiders and 49ers. How about you?
980,The Patriots, yes they are an awesome team! It's interesting how much technology there is in football today. There are tracking chips in shoulder pads and footballs.
981,Yeah. Espn's yellow line helps me out a bit. They even won an Emmy for that.
982,Haha, not sure. It's interesting how much Americans love football now. In the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars.
983,Yes. Surprisingly though, the average engineer makes more over a lifetime and the average NFL player.
984,Yes. One of my favorite bands played 2263 concerts. The Ramones toured almost non stop for 20 years.
985,I know! Well it seems like Linkin Park was on their way to catching up to that number. They played 324 concerts in 2001 alone.
986,I know. I didn't realize they were that popular. Unlike the band Creed who played a concert so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit.
987,That must have been really bad. Pink Floyd would not have had the same problem. First, they are a great band and secondly they played an Ancient Roman Amphitheater with no audience.
988,I think they recorded it and then shared the recording with fans but no one was there to witness them live.
989,That would be so cool to see a concert there. Much more exciting than a football game that only has 11 minutes of live game play.
990,I agree. I always felt like sports players made too much money. I was happy to learn that the average earnings of an engineer are more than that of an NFL or MLB player.
991,It is also nice to know that there is no rule against female players, they just need to meet the league's requirements.
992,I think so. Maybe as a kicker women could have more luck. Although it seems unlikely when you hear a New Orleans Saints cheerleader has to leave a restaurant if a player is there.
993,I agree otherwise football player should go back t making less than bowlers like in the 1960s.
994,I do like the NFL. Do you?
995,I like the Ravens and the Eagles!
996,That is crazy how short the live game actually is. Did you hear about the tracking chips in players shoulder pads?
997,They record a players every move on the field! That is so much data.
998,I am not sure. I bet every sport will eventually have trackers like that.
999,True. They even have the tracking chips inside the footballs.
1000,I am not sure. I am surprised by they do not have it all computerized.
1001,I agree. Do you know when the first nfl playoff game was played?
1002,In 1932 on an 80 yard long dirt field.
1003,I am not sure how it worked. It was in Chicago.
1004,hello,  I dont think that would work for our current situation lol Those 2 do not get a long lol
1005,I think that would be quite entertaining!  Thats pretty good,  making albums and running a country,  multi tasking!
1006,lol why?
1007,I see.  Did you know the presidents guest house is bigger than the white house?  lol
1008,lol right!  Maybe the president of zimbabwe can do a concert there!
1009,Oh sorry indonesia lol That info may possibly be wrong,  last time I checked Trump was the wealthiest by a lot!
1010,Nice!  Do you like classic radio dramas?  I dont think I would use that service,  I really like audio books.  I gues soliders used to make radios out of pencil and razor!  wow!
1011,probably not,  they were soliders in wwi
1012,Oh lol I guess I missed the joke and read it wrong lol Yeah that canadian law is kinda weird,  but they have a lot of good music,  drake,  celine dion, bryan adams lol ...justin bieber
1013,Sort of.  I watch a lot of tv shows and movies,  but I usually stream them,  I dont watch real time tv
1014,Oh my,  that is a lot of episodes!  Great for kids!  I have never watched any pokemon.  Its been great chatting with you!
1015,Well based on the information I've read it doesn't look good.
1016,I do. Trump may be unpopular but he is still the Commander and Chief. it was stated that "On a more personal level, with Trump at the head of the party, denouncing him meant jeopardizing decades of investment in a career as a conservative pundit, politician or policy wonk.
1017,Do you watch a lot of tv programs?
1018,Yeah the Simpsons made way for a lot of other animated adult shows. Did you know "In the first 400 episodes, homer Simpson has held 188 jobs".
1019,Only when i'm driving but even thats not very often. This presidency has given SNL so much to work with, reminds me of the Palin, Biden debates. Those were hilarious.
1020,No i was never a fan but i know of its popularity. I forget what its called but someone got hurt looking for Pokemon
1021,Me either. Did you know that the only U.S president to have a Phd is Woodrow Wilson
1022,Check this out, Lincoln was the first president to be photographed for his inauguration and John Wilkes Booth was in that photo.
1023,You asked me about radio earlier, do you listen?
1024,I remember my grandmother telling about a radio show called the shadow. it later became a movie with Alec Baldwin.
1025,Yeah for its time. i think it came out in the 80's. hey did you know that one of the most popular radio acts of the 1930s was a ventriloquist, a fact which baffled contemporary critics.
1026,I was wondering the same thing. I think personally that it was definitely wrong to snap even if you have a legitimate reason to be so tense.
1027,Yes definitely but it's just general wisdom to try to maintain patience and meet frustrating situations with a level head of course. But then again, he did apologize so it's not like he's some bad guy at all.
1028,Actually I heard that he already did, or at least someone tweeted as much.
1029,Oh really, why is that? I'm sure he realized that people would probably be able to empathize with his frustration with the reporters, so why not apologize.
1030,Oh, hmm maybe that tweet by James Miller was incorrect I guess. What makes you think he's not the type to apologize?
1031,Oh I didn't know that, when did he do it before?
1032,Oh yes, that's true but at least that's not as explosive as he behaved with Maria Taylor recently.
1033,He snapped at her, and gave an abrasive response to a fair question.
1034,I'm not sure, he did apologize at least but I am not so familiar with the context of how they usually punish off the field behavior like that. I guess some sort of penalty would be fair, but maybe not a whole suspension?
1035,I guess, maybe I don't think it's the big of deal to be upset as long as you acknowledge that it was wrong. A bit of anger can be healthy.
1036,Yeah exactly.
