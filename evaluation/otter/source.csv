0,Did you know that the University of Iowa's locker room is painted pink? I wonder why?,I think I did hear something about that.  I imagine it is an attempt to psych the other team out.
1,So, it would be in the visiting team's locker room but not their own?,Right.  Teams do all kinds of things to bother the competition. I've heard of teams having heated benches in the winter for themselves but not for the visitors.
2,I would hate a cold bench. Then again, I wouldn't want to be some place that cold or watching football.,I'd rather watch it inside where it's warm.  Have you heard about the Georgia Tech-Cumberland game of 1916?
3,No, what happened in that game?,Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland but here's the thing, they defeated them by a score of 222-0!
4,That is insane. How could that even happen?,I don't know but it did.  It's the highest scoring game in history.
5,I'm sure. I don't even watch much and I couldn't imagine that score. I wonder if most people left or were they curious to see how high it would go?,I guess it depended on what team you were pulling for.  To me, it's surprising that the highest scoring game was in college football and not professional.
6,Maybe it is because some are not as good in college so they may be playing against someone not on their level.,Good point.  Professional does have a player that has never fumbled the ball.
7,I've heard that. Wasn't it a Patriot player?,It was. It was a running back by the name of Benjarvus Green Ellis.
8,That is an interesting name. It's like he has a lot of names.,i guess so.  Do you watch espn?
9,No. I don't have regular cable. I use a ROKU and I think you would have to pay extra for ESPN. I didn't watch it when I did have cable though.,Oh, I was going to tell you about them winning an emmy but that's okay.  Well, do you watch or have you watched pokemon?
10,No, I haven't watch pokemon. My sons use to play with the when they were little. Now they use their phones looking for pokemon in the neighborhood. It is funny.,That is funny.  Pokemon is pretty popular and has been for a while now  They have over 750 tv episodes alone.  Well, I have to go now.  It's been nice chatting with you!  Have a great day!
11,What do you think about Keith Jacksons death?,It's sad. I wonder how many people grew up hearing his voice?
12,I imagine this number in the millions taking into account he had a 54 year broadcasting carreer, so sad, but he was old.,I like that he used this phrase alot Whoa, Nellie!
13,That was a good phrase I liked it as well, did you see the beer comercial, the one in which he used this phrase?,I didn't. I did see the ABC would not let him retire at 70!
14,Yeah I think he ended his carreer in 2006, he got lured and decided to stay, he had a great voice.,He was also a marine. Looks like he had been calling games since he was young.
15,Wow this guy sure is full with suprises, he didnt only call football games but also pro basketball games as well as other sports.,Crazy busy it seems. He didn't say anything when Woody Hayes punched a clemson player either!
16,Yeah I heard he was criticized because of this, wonder why he did that, maybe he had it coming.,I don't think he saw the punch. He also won an Emmy!
17,Do you happen to know why he won the emmy?,apparently for the work he did calling the games. He was inducted into the sportscasters hall of fame too.
18,Yeah I can see why, the guy has a big resume its sad that his wife and children are left behind, as well as three grandchildren, they must be crying a lot.,probably so. Snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his son's high school football team.
19,Thats nice from Snoop Dogg, can you tell me more about that song?,no, it doesn't say anything more about it. Sorry. I can tell you this though. The highest paid across all u.s. department of defense employees are three football coaches of the service branch teams
20,Oh I see I will have to google it then, and they must have a good salary then, the inventor of basketball was a bad coach.,14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums belong to american college football teams! I guess it is a pretty popular sport.
21,Do you watch or keep up on much basketball?It's definitely a team sport I didn't play much of,I watch it from time to time as I enjoy it. do you have a favorite player?
22,I haven't really had a favorite since Michael Jordan. The guy who invented the sport was a coach at the University of Kansas, and the only losing one at that,Go figure. do you know who kareem abdul-jabaar was?
23,I heard he was good at dunking. It was banned from college basketball for over ten years from how frequently he used it,yeah so strange. do you know what the nz basketball team is called?
24,Do they have an official name, or are you referencing the nickname Tall Blacks?,Yeah I am not too sure but that is certainly what they are called
25,Apparently the Supreme Court enjoys a game of basketball too. On the top floor of the building they shoot hoops at what has been called "the highest court in the land.",Good for them, how handy to play there at work.
26,Many of my friends growing up were big basketball and footballs fans. The highest paid state employee in 39 of the 50 states coaches one of those two states at the college level,I guess it pays to be a coach then. the players themselves also get paid quite a bit too. do you listen to the radio much?
27,I don't, actually, but I use other things that utilize radio waves. It's pretty crazy how the sound can be extracted and transformed over miles,Actually if you turn it to am you can catch Jupiter's storms
28,Those are some strong storms! Considering how many artists are from Canada, I wouldn't mind tuning into stations that have to play at least 40% Canadian music by law,Yes very true. do you know how soldiers used to make radios during WWII?
29,From what I remember, all it would take is a pencil and razorblade, though I'm not sure how it would make sound,I do not even know what channels they would be able to listen to
30,If they were in Europe, it would be interesting if they could pick up Finnish stations. One of them has a new program in classical Latin,The one that gives the news in latin right?
31,Hi are you a football fan?,Hi, no not really.  Are you?
32,I watch it during the season because I don't have anything better to do.  Especially for the Monday and Thursday night games.,I get that, especially when there is only 11 minutes of action in a game.  I guess the rest is commercials?
33,Isn't that crazy that it's such a short amount of time for something they drag out of 3 hours?,I know! They sure do milk it for all its worth.
34,ESPN won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow first down line on tv.  That has been a good addition to watching games.,Yeah, that was a good addition. Can't believe that Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled.  Amazing!
35,That's an incredible stat to have!  The average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an NFL or MLB player.  Probably due to having longer careers.,Yeah, that's what I would think.  NFL careers are probably pretty short on average due to injury, and it is really hard to get to the majors and stick there long enough to make any serious money
36,Yes.  Did you know that there is no written rule that prevents females from playing in the NFL?  Maybe we'll see on soon?,Maybe we will!  That would help boost ratings, I would think.  Maybe then they'll start letting the Saint's cheerleaders eat in the same restaurants as the players.  What a stupid rule!
37,That is an odd rule for sure!  Kind of dumb.,Do you a cat?  They are amazing creatures.  One is a mayor in Alaska!
38,I have one outside.  Yes they are.  I would like to see the cat cafes they have in Japan.  Do you know how those work?,Yes!  They can pay by the hour to play with cats and have drinks. Seems like a cool place!
39,I agree!  When a cat reaches the age of 15 they have usually spent 10 of those years sleeping!,That's a life well lived lol.  Cats can also co-author physics papers!
40,What?  That is crazy!  lol  There is a cat named Stubbs who is the mayor of a town called Talkeetna in Alaska!  How does that work?  lol,I wonder who that cat ran against?  It would've been funny if the other candidate was a dog!
41,Hahah Yes it would be!  I've had a good time chatting with you!,Me too.  Have a great day!
42,Hi there, do you watch the NFL?,Hi! Yes I do sometimes. What's your favorite team?
43,I think the Patriots, I like them best. One of their former QB never fumbled a ball in his career. How about you?,My husband is from the bay area so we root for the Oakland Raiders.
44,Nice, cool. Do you know what the highest score ever recorded in a game is?,222-0
45,Yeah that must have been quite the game. Do you know who played, the two teams?,Georgia tech and cumberland. Are you familiar with different kinds of football from different parts of the world?
46,Yeah there are tons of different kinds like soccer, Canadian and Australian football, rugby, a bunch of them,I'm originally from Hungary and our football there is soccer. My grandpa was a huge fan.
47,Nice, it is a good sport. Did you know ESPN won an Emmy once?,I had no idea. I wonder why the University of Iowa's locker room is painted pink.
48,I think they did that to intimidate the opposing team but I am not sure if that really works,Oh ok I see. Do you watch basketball?
49,I watch it sometimes. I didn't know until recently that the dunk shot was banned because of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,I didn't know that either. Or that in 39 out of 50 states, the highest paid state employee is either a college football or basketball coach. There is lots of money in sports.
50,Yeah that is for sure, lots of people watch it so no surprise I guess. Do you know who invented the sport?,James Naismith. Interesting that he is the only losing coach in the University of Kansas history
51,Yeah that is pretty bizarre. Have you heard of the highest basketball court in the land?,I haven't heard of it. Do you know where it is located?
52,Yeah it is in the US supreme court building and it is on the top floor, hence the name I am guessing,What is your favorite basketball team?
53,Hi. I didn't know that benjarvus green-ellis never had a fumble.  Impressive!,I know, right? I thought it was weird how the cheerleaders arent allowed to eat in the same restaurants as the nfl players.
54,yeah, that is bizarre.  Iowa's visiting locker room is pink.  Strange,I wonder if that was meant to try to demoralize the players
55,Seems like it would work lol.,I was shocked that the highest score in a football game was 222... THATS CRAZY!
56,No doubt.  And the other team was shut out!  Also, bowlers used to make more than football players.  That's changed!,Yea it has... could you imagine if bowlers were paid more than nfl players now? They would make average 6-12 million a year for bowling lol
57,That'd be nuts!  An NFL game only has 11 minutes of gameplay...I never would have guessed that,I already knew that, which is why I get so frustrated with how long a game takes :(
58,Yeah, I can imagine that would be frustrating.  I usually only watch the super bowl and that game takes forever!,I thought it was pretty cool that the cat in the opening scene of the Godfather, was just a stray. Chances are that was an unplanned scene.
59,I'd bet that, too.  So, in asia you can pay to play with cats...now that's weird!,I think its a waste of money lol just get a cat
60,no doubt, cats are everywhere!,Everywhere including Alaska... where they are made mayors. Now thats weird lol
61,They also co-author physics papers!,Im not sure the actual purpose of either, but they are both pretty strange!
62,Yeah, I don't get it either lol.  Apparently cats just sleep for two-thirds of their lives anyway,yea, Im 35 right now... I couldn't imagine sleeping 12 years of that. No wonder cats are considered lazy lol
63,That's basically sleeping 16 hours a day...I cannot imagine that,I will say that I was pleased to see that at least an engineer has higher wages than an nfl or mlb player. I faithfully believe that sport players are WAY overpaid.
64,Considering how unimportant their jobs are, I agree.  Unfortunately they generate a ton of revenue sense people pay so much for tickets and merch.  Its all a waste IMO,Hugh waste! I think that a percentage of the earned income should automatically go to funding projects or foundations that better the citizens lives or economy.
65,Hi, how are you?,Doing good? Do you follow football at all? It's a family of sports that includes rugby, gridiron, and soccer
66,Why yes, I do I love all types of football.  Do you like football?,Yea I enjoy gridiron, I also think rugby football is pretty interesting too, would love to play it
67,Interesting to me that the word "football" is understood to refer to whichever form of football that is most popular in the regional context in which the word appears.  So football in some areas, is called soccer in other parts.,Yea, I wonder if there is any other football variation types besides American football, soccer, and rugby
68,Oh, there's more, for sure.,I wonder how much money other footballers make, in the US an average engineer makes more than an average nfl player over their lifetime
69,I think the true Soccer players make pretty good bank.,I wonder if soccer players are tracked like how the NFL embeds chips into shoulder pads and footballs to track things like velocity and location
70,I guess the could place a tracker in their shin guards or shoes?  Not many places to place a tracker on them, unlike the NFL players. Lol,No, I guess not. It's funny how the nfl tracks all these stats yet the average game only has 11 minutes of gameplay
71,I know, I felt like the last Super bowl I watched was about 3 hours long.,Yea that was excruciating to watch. Do you have a favorite nfl team out of the 32?
72,I like the New England Patriots and the GOAT!,Yea the patriots are a great team. Did you know apparently Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled the ball in his career?
73,Yes, that's an impressive feat, just imagine the stress and pressure to remain perfect.  I know I couldn't do it.lol,Yea that pretty tough, probably tougher than the time Georgia tech scored 222 points on Cumberland back in 1916
74,That sounds like a train wreck, but it would never happen today.  That last Super bowl was the lowest scoring Super bowl, ever. On a side note, I read somewhere that the Eagles once set up a court in their stadium for six years because of their fan's bad behavior.  Isn't that wild?,Lol well the fans in Philli do have a bad reputation so I'm not surprised there was an actual court inside the stadium
75,Hello, you follow the NFL much?,I do. I am getting ready to watch the playoff games
76,for sure, who you rooting for? Saints?,Absolutely and the Patriots.
77,for sure, did you know the saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating at restaurants containing nfl players? I am rooting for the patriots also,Yeah, its a bit hypocritical of the team and the NFL to have a rule like that
78,for sure, very sexist. Speaking of the patriots, did you know benjarvus green-ellis never fumbled in his career,Didn't he fumble a couple of weeks ago?
79,He recently retired a year or two ago, that is impressive. Hopefully the patriots take a note from him during the playoffs,This years 17-week season has wrapped up and now we hit the playoffs. Who do you think will win the Super Bowl this year?
80,I think the bears have a chance, but I think the saints will make a run, you?,Yes. I am worried though this may be the last year of Brees and Brady. I will have to find a young QB to follow now
81,for sure, patrick mahomes is killing it and a good role model, he may be the next star qb if he follows up with another great season,I am really loving watching that kid above all the other young QBs in the NFL.
82,for sure, do you follow college football at all?,A little bit. I am a secret fan of the Chiefs. I follow Ohio State on the college level
83,for sure, I am an Iowa fan, did you know they painted their opponent locker room pink?,Yeah, thats a bit ridiculous. I need to look at pics online to see what it looks like.
84,for sure, it was from their coach years ago who was a psychology graduate. Good chatting with you, you were fast and informative!,You as well
85,I'm wondering when women are finally going to play in the NFL.,I think there was a womens' league years ago but I am not sure. It was not the NFL though.
86,Was that the league with lingerie or something? Five or six a side football?,Something like that yes. But I think if a woman wants to play in the NFL and is good enough, she should be allowed.
87,I wonder if women can play some positions like kicker and punter because size is not really the issue? What about male cheerleaders though?,Cheerleading is really hard! You have to be athletic. I have a male friend who was a cheerleader in high school and he was great at it.
88,I've heard that the Saints cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as the players. What up with dat?,I hadn't heard that! Wow. I have heard that cheerleaders have a lot of strict rules though. Do the football players have a lot of rules they have to follow?
89,Probably rules about drug use. And standing during the National Anthem!  :0,Haha! I can't believe how much football coaches get paid. I heard that the coaches for the military teams get paid more than anyone else in the department of defense. That's crazy!
90,That's the market for you. There's so much money from TV and stuff. I heard that in the past the players really didn't make much. Now engineers make more over their careers than pro athletes.,It seems like it is very easy to get injuries that can end a career. So engineers probably are able to put in a lot more years at their jobs.
91,Yeah. It's a fantasy to think a person could become a football player. Seriously, engineers are needed more than players. Priorities in society can get screwy.,I went to high school with someone who played for the Panthers. Now he sells cars. You're right about priorities though. Football is more important than academics in most high schools and colleges. They spend a lot of money on it.
92,I would play high school to get a scholarship though. The best way to get an education is to be a good athlete, not a good student.,I heard there is a high school stadium in Texas that cost $60 million. I don't really think that is right.
93,How much money goes to textbooks after the stadium is payed for? I heard that a high school team kept playing a game even when their school was on fire.,I heard that 14 of the world's largest stadiums belong to college football teams... I wonder how many of those are state schools. Our taxes shouldn't be paying for that.
94,I wonder how many jobs are created though. I know lots of people love the sport.,That is true. I think maybe it would be better if instead of school teams it was more like the European soccer system, where you grow up playing for a club and then go pro.
95,Yeah, that's true. No confusion over the purpose of school.,I've enjoyed talking about football! I have to go and have my dinner now.
96,Hi.  do you watch football,Yes I do, I am especially interested right now in following Jordan Reed to see if he will really be able to take the next step in his promising career after his surgery.
97,who is your team,Well, Jordan Reed is on the Redskins, so I am following them currently.
98,I see.  do you know that the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916, and the score was 222-0,Yes, I had heard that before! I wonder how much money football players made in that time. I heard that in the 1960s it was only half as much as popular bowlers of the time.
99,Yeah, that fact surprised me a lot.,I was also surprised to learn that ESPN won an Emmy for creating that yellow first down line graphic on television. I never realize that sports media could also win those Hollywood awards!
100,I do not know how a sport program could win an emmy.  Did they have an acting skill?,No, I guess that the yellow line thing was so innovative for American football media coverage at the time that it was considered worthy of an award!
101,I concur.  Btw, did you know that former Patriot running back benjarvus green-ellis never fumbled the footall in his career,No, I didn't, but that's impressive. I wonder if they have used those NFL tracking chips in the shoulder pad to record his speed and velocity and stuff?
102,I do not think so because this is a new technology,Oh, that's a good point! Well either way it's too bad that football players even that talented only make half as much as engineers
103,but it is quick money and fame.,Yeah but also it sounds like they control your life quite a bit! Even other athletes such as the NFL New Orleans Saints cheerleaders have strict rules against eating in a restaurant at the same time as an NFL player.
104,I see.  Did you know that nfl has no written rule against female players.  They are allowed to play if they meet the requirements,Wow, so the NFL actually treats women better as players than the cheerleaders get treated apparently!
105,I would think so.  Btw, nice chatting with you.  Happy holiday,Merry Christmas to you, and I'll leave you with this fun fact: The university of Iowa's locker room provided for visiting football players is completely painted pink!
106,Thank you.,I thought that was funny, hopefully the teams are good sports.
107,Hello there, are you a fan of football?,I am a fan, what about you?
108,I am as well, did you watch the Super Bowl this past Sunday?,I did, I was rooting for the patriots, what about you? the game was really close and really defensive not sure if I liked it
109,Yeah I didn't like that it was so low scoring and mostly defense, it does not make for an exciting game.  I was partial to either, but I am impressed by the Patriots domination of the league the last 2 decades.,Its actually the Superbowl with the fewest points scored, and the Patriots have done things right that is for sure, they used to have a great player called Benjarvus Green Ellis.
110,Yeah did you kow he never had a fumble in his entire career!?  That is very impressive.,I know, that is really impressive! I bet only a few players have accomplished that, maybe he is the only one, did you know that ESPN won an emmy because of the creation of the first down line
111,Yeah that is an interesting fact.  I am trying to think if I can remember watching games before they put that yellow line up there.,The yellow line has been there a long time and I think that the emmy is well deserved as it has definetely contributed with a lot to the game.
112,Yeah I think it has totally changed how people were able to watch and cheer, it makes so much of a difference.,It does, I guess thats why games were so unfair in old times, there was a team that lost by 222 points
113,Yeah isn't that crazy, I wonder if there were any defense playing that day at all!,I know, it seems like the other team was blind or they were all injured, another interesting fact is that bowlers made more than football players back in 1960
114,Yeah I thought that was pretty wild.  I guess if I got the chance to do it again, I would be a pro bowler in the 60's!,I guess thats a safer sport, football has proven to cause a lot of brain damage in players so thats not good.
115,Yeah it has, if you ever watch the movie Concussion, with Will Smith, it definitely makes you think twice about how much damage the sport does to ones body and brain most of all.,I think ive seen that film before, I will google it later or maybe its available in Netflix, there is a crazy rules the New Orlans Saints have, its really sexist and rude in fact.
116,Yeah that rule seems so outdated and dumb.  I can't believe that is an actual rule.,I know right, I mean cheerleaders could actually sue the team for something like that, its a rule that should be abolished
117,Hi Turker, are you a fan of NFL, if yes do you watch Thursday night football?,I am a fan, my Thursday nights wouldn't be the same withou that sacred sport, what about you?
118,I feel the same way, I like Thursday night football and I hope nothing change.,It seems like the Thursday packages isnt going anywhere so that is a good thin, did you know Disney is the owner of ABC and ESPN?
119,No I had no Idea, since Disney always had it own channel, they must have recently brought ABC and ESPN.,Yeah seems like they are buying everything these days, Star Wars, Marvel and now those two channels as well
120,Wow, Disney doing good, I knew there was the Disney channel for many years, when I was small that was my favorite channel.,It was  great channel I liked it as well, crazy how much money TV moves and also how much money football moves, $900 million for Thursday night games alone
121,Wow it's amazing, did you know ESPN is laying off large numbers of workers?,No I didnt know that, its terrible, I wonder why, have you watched The Bing Bang Theory?
122,I used to, but not any more since they got older, after that seems like things wasn't the same.,Well its a really funny show, it has an average of 18 million viewers. The NBC has great series in it.
123,Yes I read about the viewers, did you know that women has a chance to play in the nfl if they meet eligibility?,I didnt know about that, what do you think about that rule? would you like to watch a woman in the NFL?
124,I don't think so, because this will change the entire paste of the game, I don't think 250 and 300 lbs menwould want to tackle women head on, I would like to see a WNFL, women only.,Yeah I dont think its a good sport to mix genres, do you know who Matt Patricia is?
125,No I don't have any Ideal, does she have something to do with the NfL?,Matt Patricia is a male lol, he is a rocket scientist and also a coach in the NFL
126,Wow, I feel a little embarrassed for not knowing that, first chance I get I will read upon him.,Patricia its a girls name so don't worry its an honest mistake, he must be a really smart guy though being a rocket scientist and all
127,I thought it was a woman at first, did you know that only 11 minutes of live playtime in a nfl game?,No didn't know that, 11 minutes of live playtime doesn't seem right, anyways im getting kind of tired, its late so Im going to call it a night.
128,Good Morning!  Hope your day is going well,It is going well.  I'm considering catching a movie - what will you do today?
129,I'm working today, looking forward to the weekend and some relaxation.  Too bad football season is over - it's fun to waste away a Sunday watching football!,I agree - Patriots did their job - too bad for the Rams. I think I'll catch a Disney movie - the Ralph and the Internet sounds good - that's a sequel to a movie that was in the works for a long time!
130,Yep, not a fan of either team, but the Patriots are amazing - probably wont see a run like this again (and they're not done!).  My kids saw Wreck It Ralph 2 and loved it, Disney does a good job,Can the Patriots keep it up forever, that's the key - I think the risks of football are a bit high, however. I'm glad Disney keeps at it. Of course Disneyland, all the hype and all the merchandise, makes movie-making well worth it.
131,Tom Brady & Bill Bilichek will keep going forever!  Neither wants to be proven that they cant win without the other.  Disney movies are starting to rehash the classics, but like you said - with all the merch, how can you blame them?!?!,Did you ever wonder how TV gets all those great shots of plays at the football games - apparently they use tracking chips embedded in shoulder pads - yikes, someone is always watching you! I liked that commercial about the guy going to heaven and getting the new car from his grandpa - then he woke up and was in his cubicle at work and someone had Heimleched him - so funny!
132,I've heard about the tracking chips in the pads / on players and I wonder why they don't put a chip in the ball so they know when it breaks the plain of the End Zone?  I don't think I've seen the commercial you mention - was it on during the SB?,Good idea about the end zone. The commercial was in the Super Bowl and cracked me up because when the guy recovered after being apparently gone for a bit - it was back to work  - and he really wanted the car! So funny!
133,I guess I tuned out the commercials like I tuned out most of the SB game....  and our game of squares was terrible!,Sounds like you are a big fan - funny fact, an average engineer makes more in his lifetime than the average pro football player - I think engineering is safer.
134,That doesn't surprise me at all, given the average career in the NFL is less than 3 years and while the superstars make a ton, the average guy doesn't,I think that the political controversies of the past few years hasn't helped the sport too much - some people just want to watch folks play ball. I see the Patriots owner is in trouble today - so that's another negative out there.  Back to Disney - are there any animation films up for oscars this year?
135,I heard about the massage parlor thing on the radio - shocking!!!  I think Ralph Breaks the Internet is up for an Oscar.  Isle of Dogs will win, I think,Isn't the Incredibles 2 movie out there as well? My kids saw it and liked it - sounds like it had some dark moments too - maybe beyond little kids ages. Speaking of football salaries -a fun fact - in the 60's a professional bowler made more than an NFL player.
136,My kids like Incredibles 2 too - I just realized my kids see many movies without me....  I wonder how much money top pro bowlers make?  Most of the professional athletes didn't make much money until the TV revenue started rolling in and popularity of the superstars,I'm sure TV had a lot to do with it. Another fun fact - the highest scoring game was in 1916 when Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland 222 to 0. Ouch.  Poor coach!
137,Talk about a blow out!  Cumberland folded it's program after that game I bet....,I bet the coach changed careers after that - how can you carry on with that on your resume. I guess this will be turn 10 - right? Should we wrap it up? Hope you have a good day if that's true.
138,The Roseanne reboot did not last long did it?,Not with her on it.  I heard it is still going, but maybe under a different name.
139,The original show was kind of good.  It was not "California" pretty, but showed middle class. Unusual for the day.,Very much so, it also showed real struggles, which didnt happen much either.
140,I suppose the unreal part of the show is the way we all get to comment.  Sara Silverman "loved" the reboot. There are many others.,Everyone has the right to their opinion.  Sometimes it is just best for those in the public eye to be careful how they state theirs.
141,So, Rosanne was a trump supporter, the sister was not (on the show).  Do you think that the portrayal of trump supporters was unreal in some way?,I didn't watch it.  But i heard that the portrayal caused some problems, because it treated politics as irrelevant.
142,Irrelevant must be a hollywood buzzword.  South park, a leader in irrelevance, aired a spoof of family guy, a show about irrelevance.  It makes my whole argument irrelevant.,I wonder if that made the flowers they got from the Simpsons crew.... irrelevant..  LOL
143,It might have.  I can not remember the episode of Simpsons where Bart neither appears or is mentioned.  Do you know what that one was about?,I dont, honestly I dont even recall that episode.  There are so many of them.
144,Yes.  There are so many.  The ideas are repeating.  There are over 750 episodes of pokeman, thats 50 a year for 16 years.  Some times you have to end a show when its time.,Yeah, like 15 years ago....  lol
145,I always wondered who narrated Thomas the Tank Engine.  that was a nice relaxing show.  Those troublesome trucks are at it again.,Well you might recognize some voices, Ringo Star and Alec Baldwin each did 52 episodes.
146,Then there was George Carlin and the seven words you can never say.,I love Carlins explanation of the F word as all parts of speech.
147,That is a classic thing.  He has done a lot over the years.  Do you suppose he would like the 3 horizontal lines for menu items being called a hamburger icon?  Carlin might not have like computers.,Yeah, I just call that the menu button.  I dont know where hamburger came from.
148,The Reskins really need Alex Smith back in locker room and more importantly on the field dont you think,Alex Smith was a great asset. He took the time to really get a feel for people
149,Its a shame that he is seeing the same troubles as Griffin did. Its uncanny.,He was in the league a long time. At least he gave the game everything he had
150,I didnt' think he was all that of a QB but his teammates really took to him right away,He was a true professional.
151,I don't think Smith will be the same even if he does make it back to the field after his gruesome injury. Much like Griffin he might be a back up but thats all,Well at least he will get back up. Thankfully since the NFL uses tracking chips they can track players moves and help avoid crazy injuries
152,He does have an education to help too; he has a masters degree,Yeah he is clearly smart having earned his degree so quickly
153,One QB I don't like it Baker Mayfield, I wish he would have stuck to professional gaming instead of football,I'm confused as to why the saints cheerleaders cant eat in the same restaurantas the players that seems like an absurd rule
154,It is; proof of the hypocrisy of NFL and its rules,You needn't look hard to find proof of that
155,This year's 17 week season has wrapped up and now its playoff time,I wonder who will be the NFC and AFC champs that will go to the Superbowl in Feb
156,It is likely that we will only see 11 minutes of actual gameplay no matter who plays,yes no OT this year
157,Do you think we will ever see a female in the NFL?,Its not against the rules so it is likely someone is raising the first female NFL player as we speak
158,did you know that Hugh Laurie is the highest paid TV actor ever?,Hi! No I did not know that, very interesting! I was reading an article about the Patriots Josh McDaniels just might take a coaching position! Do you watch football?
159,I do  a little bit, I want the patriots to win tomorrow, what about you?,Yes, I don't follow it very much but I definitely like the Patriots. McDaniels has been one of the highest paid coordinator, crazy!
160,ya that is crazy, did you know that Kellan moore is left handed? hes the only one in the NFL,Wow, you would think there would be more left handers! I like how the NFL has no rules against females if they meet requirements.
161,ya I was wondering that, I can see a female kicker. to be honest we will probably see that in our lifetime,I hope we do see females in the NFL, but man that is a tough sport and I can't imagine getting tackled. So interesting though that a full football game has only 11 minutes of actual live play...so I guess you could hang in there that long.
162,yes that is crazy because games take hours to watch, also crazy that the nfl puts special chips in their uniforms so that they can track things like speed and location,I know it is crazy. I didn't know that, very cool! There is so much that goes on during a football game!
163,there is, I read that baker mayfield was a halo 3 champion and could beat anyone on his campus at that game,Wow, haha that is pretty interesting! I love the quarterbacks in football, they are the best at being a leader for offense, love it!
164,ya that iss true, do you watch football? do you know who invented the huddle,I watch some football, don't have a lot of time to watch it. I think the huddle was invented by a deaf quarterback so nobody could outside the huddle could read the hand signals.....
165,haha that is true, I wonder how good he was, I wonder if he could call audibles even though he was deaf,Very interesting thought, how rough would that be to play football while being deaf. So do you watch the superbowl, there's a lot of drama this year about the NFL and superbowl.
166,that would suck, and yes I'm going to a party tomorrow, i want the patriots to win what about you?,We always watch the Superbowl, will have a couple people over but nothing big. I am rooting for the Patriots though!
167,haha me too, do you like Michael Caine? I guess he only got into acting to chase cute girls haha,Haha, that's funny! He made the right choice to get into drama! I like Jim Carrey in Drama films but he won't do drama anymore. Love his comedy too though.
168,Hi do you watch dramas?,I sure do. Did you know Jon Hamm taught drama in a high school?
169,Cool. Did you ever watch the show House MD?,Yeah and he even taught Ellie Kemper, she is so funny. Yeah I watch House
170,Laurie made lots of money there, $700 000 per episode,That is a  lot. Patrick Stewart also teaches drama in the UK at the master level
171,Neat. Do you like Jim Carrey?,I sure do he is pretty funny. DO you like him?
172,I like him a lot and he no longer is doing dramas because they do not project positivity,Have you heard of the show Ikea Heights?
173,I have not heard of that, WHat channel is it on?,I am not sure but it is shot in California in an Ikea store and people there do not even know
174,WOw. Do you like radio dramas?,I like them sometimes. Do you listen to them?
175,Yeah I do and there is a free website where you can listen for free,Nice. Do you know why soap operas are called as such?
176,Hmm I have no idea, I thought because they are so cheesy, what is the reason?,Actually it is because there were soap manufacturers that sponsored them
177,Oh that makes so much sense. Do you know why Caine became an actor?,Hmm I am not sure of that. He went to college for it?
178,Nope he just attended drama class in high school because that is where the pretty girls went,Hahaha the guy really knew what he was after even that early
179,hello, how are you?,Hi, great.  You?
180,same. what is your favorite article?,This was cool to read.  Nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field. they are also located inside footballs to track: velocity, rotation, ball speed and location.
181,That is crazy. Also it says that nfl has no written rule against female player. I can't picture a woman playing such a sport,I saw that also.  I agree.
182,I recall once a girl tried to get on the football team of my highs school. It didnt work out well. Had to quit,Really?  Did she get blasted?
183,She did for sure. She was only 5 feet tall!,I'm glad to hear they treated her with respect, as an equal player.  An average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay
184,New orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any nfl player and if they are already dining at a restaurant and an nfl player comes in after, the cheerleaders are required to leave. Isn't this pathetic?,Yeah, that's pretty crazy.  The average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player and an average mlb player.
185,Now that's suprising. I wonder how much would that be,I'm not sure.  I think it's because NFL players do not play past their 30s normally
186,True. How about golf? are you familiar with it?,Not really.  I've played but I'm terrible at it.  The average american golf course consumes around 312,000 gallons of water per day.
187,looks intriguing. There is a golf course in dubai that requires 4,000,000 gallons of water a day!. I would love to see that,Wow, me too.  Samuel l. jackson puts a golf clause in his film contracts that allows him to play golf twice a week during production.
188,Now, that's smart,Haha, yep it is.
189,It was very nice chatting with you. Have a great day,You as well.  Have a great day.
190,Are you a sports fan by any chance?,i do like sports. i dont get much chance to watch these days. you?
191,I enjoy a few. Did you know that Babe Ruth was America's most famous golfer at one point?,i bet it didnt hurt that he was a great baseball player. he could any ball a mile.
192,I didn't realize he was so multi-talented. Did you know that on average American golf courses consume 312,000 gallons of water per day?!,that is an insane amount of water for just a bunch of grass. i wonder how much that costs actually.
193,I agree it's a huge waste. One in Dubai uses 4,000,000 per day!,rich people have their priorities. i could never afford to play golf, i think.
194,It is expensive. I feel like that water could be put to so much better use especially in a place like Dubai that has an arid climate.,i guess the oil makees them rich and money changes peoples perception of reality. in the future they might regret the waste.
195,Good point and I'm sure they will. Also interestingly. in America golf courses make up more land space that Rhode Island and Delaware combined.,i wonder how many people in the us actually play golf. its a good sport for business but i think the cost must be prohibitive.
196,With the price of equipment and fees it is very expensive. Do you enjoy football?,i do like to watch football. only get the chance from time to time. You?
197,I do. Did you know that the NFL has no written rules against female players?,i heard something about that, but then again i dont think they ever imagined a woman showing up to try out.
198,Possibly. An engineer makes more in a lifetime than a football player. Knowing that, which career would you choose?,well, i am opposed to concussions and injuries, so would probably go with engineer.
199,I agree. It would be  so much easier on your body.,Or i could just be a supermodel. not many concussions either. Anyway, nice chat!
200,Are you a big golf fan?,I liked to play with my dad when I was younger, but don't keep much up with it now. I like football and other sports more. How about you?
201,I played more when I was younger and had more free time.  I'm a bigger football fan.  Did you know that the University of Iowa had their visitors locker room painted pink?  Must have been to mess with opponents minds. lol,Yeah, but seems a little sexist, frankly. It's a pretty sexist industry of a whole, despite technically allowing women to play.
202,True.  I agree.  Did you know that in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars of the day?  I bet that number is reversed now.,Haha, I bet the division is way more than twice the amount now, too. It's much better to be an engineer, these days, though.
203,I agree on the engineer part.  Probably because they have longer careers.  Did you know that ESPN won an emmy for the superimposed yellow first down line on tv?,Yeah, that line makes watching the game on TV much easier.
204,I agree.  Out of the 32 NFL teams do you have a favorite?  I'm a Steelers fan.,I'm a Cowboys fan, myself, even though we'll never make it to the Super Bowl again, it seems.
205,They will get there again.  That's a big stadium they have and a huge scoreboard!,Haha, well if that's what it takes to make it to the Super Bowl, Cowboys have it in the bag! We still miss old school Romo, I think. He was good in the beginning.
206,Yes.  He got beat up there the last few years.  I think if it wasn't for that things would have turned out better.  I was just reading that there are only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay in an average NFL game.  I kind of was always curious of how much they actually played.,Yeah, and they put all these tracking chips in everything!
207,Kind of scary when you think about it.  I often wonder what household products they put these chips in.  I know someone who works for a lighting company and they said their company has developed chips that are in lights that can record audio and video and you wouldn't even know the chips were there...plus they cost virtually nothing to make.,I'm not surprised, everything is connected to an app you can talk to so of course things are constantly listening. Even small chips have to communicate to each other somehow.
208,Scary.  Makes you wonder if the chips in the footballs could be programmed to be attracted to the chips in the shoulder pads of the wide receivers.,Maybe it's another deflate-gate all over again! They could be in the footballs, and able to change the pressure!
209,Interesting point to ponder over. Hmmm... I was looking at some golf course things and the average American course uses 312,000 gallons of water per day!  Holy smokes!,Yeah, it's incredibly wasteful. There's one in Dubai that uses four million. Anyway, it's been fun talking to you about sports!
210,Do you like watching football?,I do.  I watched the last superbowl on tv.
211,I did too but mostly just because I wanted to go to a party. I probably won't watch football until the next superbowl on the first Sunday of February of next year.,It is nice to be able to talk about it with coworkers and friends.  Do you know that lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than lifetime earnings of an average nfl player.
212,That is surprising. And in the 1960s, top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars.,I am surprised.  Football players (top ones) make much more money than bowlers now.
213,Yeah, people do really love their football. I don't really, maybe because there are only about 11 minutes of live gameplay per game.,Americans love NFL games. Do you know that it has 32 teams divided equally between NFC and AFC?
214,No, I did not know that. Football has come a long way. The technology is awesome. Now shoulder pads and balls have trackers.,NFL uses tracking chips to record every move by players.
215,The footballs track rotation, velocity, ball speed and location. Pretty neat.,It is neat.  That way, the teams can strategize their games.
216,I wonder if there will ever be any women playing in the NFL. There are no explicit rules against female players.,There is no rule but I do not think most women are interested in joining American football teams.  This type of football is too physical, unlike soccer.
217,Some NFL players have just incredible talent. RB Bejarvus green-ellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career,That is incredible.  I need to read more about him.
218,Do you like baseball too?,It is rather boring to me.  I have never watched world series, even on tv.
219,You are not alone. The women's world cup had higher TV ratings than the world series in the US.,I am glad that I'm not alone.  I feel bad since my best friend is into it.
220,Do you enjoy football?,I love NFL, and you?
221,I love football too. I used to play pickup football with my friends or with my family all the time, but not so much anymore. I love watching NFL though! Did you know there's actually no rule against women playing in the NFL?,If they can ball they can play lol
222,Exactly! Only if they can pass the eligibility requirements though. I'd love to see some women take on Tom Brady!,The university of iowa visitor locker room is already pink.
223,True! I bet it's to make the opposing team feel emasculated. Did you know that New Orleans cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as any NFL player? Even if they're already there first. They would have to leave!,What if the NFL player was female then?
224,That's so true. I wonder... the rule sounds pretty misogynistic anyway. I wonder if there can be a male cheerleader.,Did you know espn invented the yellow line?
225,I didn't, but that makes sense. I think they got an Emmy for it! Aren't the Emmy's for TV shows? That's so weird.,To them it is still a show I guess.  In 1916 georgia tech won 222 to zero
226,What?! That's crazy. And since an average game is only 11 minutes in actual live gameplay, that's especially insane!,If I were cumberland, the losing team, I would have given up by the first quarter!
227,Exactly! Imagine being on that team and realizing you're going down in history as the biggest defeat ever!,In the 60;s, pro bowlers made more than football players
228,Wow, that's odd. Today, engineers make more than the average NFL player over their lifetime. Maybe I should invest in some more education!,I have heard that.  I think it is a little misleading because the average NFL career is only 3-4 years and they still have time to find a career at 24 or 25 years old lol.
229,That's a fair point. Do you like the Patriots? I'm a big Giants fan so I don't like the Patriots very much. Did you know that in one of the past Super Bowls between the Giants and the Patriots, the Giants ACCIDENTALLY scored a touchdown and won the game when they were trying to not score a touchdown?,I hate the patriots.  That is amazing about the Giants.  Beat them alleged Cheaters every time!  The are the Lannisters of the NFL.
230,Yeah I heard that the author of Game of Thrones called them that. I hate Bill Belichick, although he is the "winningest" coach in NFL postseason.,Yeah I know.  Enough is enough...I hope he goes back to the Browns haha.  Take care
231,Hello,Hi. The NFL seems to be at the end of its days.
232,That's what people seem to be saying everywhere, but I don't know.  They have gotten through scandals and issues before.  I'm not counting them out yet.,What about the problems with the NCAA though? The NFL needs the players.
233,I get that and it is valid, but it's like any sport.  If 1 person quits, there are 5 waiting to take their place.   If players don't want to play, then they should move along.,What about the fans though. People might get bored of a game when the quality goes down.
234,That is true.  Everything runs in cycles though.  I liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out.  Fans are fickle.  Their... our views are important, but we come and go.,I wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest, get more fans.
235,Oh, it absolutely would.  It would be like... and I know I am going to butcher the name here, but when Manon Reheaume played in the NHL.  My only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick.,I see your point. Long term, will women stay? True.
236,I feel like... there are enough talented women athletes out there, that a woman kicker or QB is possible, perhaps a wide receiver.,Women can be tough too. Would a coach like Bill Belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the Super Bowl?
237,This is going to come off sounding bad, but it isn't meant to.  I think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views.  The sponsors would love the coverage.,Belichick has done well in the post season, so I think he's looking at it from a strategic point of view. The sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products.
238,Oh absolutely.  Belichek is looking at it from the right angle too.  He wants to win, that's what he is paid for.  I think the guy would hire a green Martian if he thought it would guarantee an extra TD.,Tom Brady and Belichick have done well together. I wonder how Brady would react to a woman in the huddle.
239,What a combo those two are.  While I'm not a huge fan of Brady, I do think that he is enough of a professional to be able to adapt if a scenario like that ever actually took place.,I wonder whether the male players would get jealous of the coverage she gets. If there is revenue sharing, they might not care because they make more $
240,I think they almost certainly will. It happened in NASCAR when Danica Patrick joined. Then after they get used to it, it will gradually get to be a normal thing. They will adapt to it.,Wow, she is awesome. The violence of the NFL is a bit different though. I wonder if the male players might be hesitant to smash her hard.
241,hello,  do you watch football?,Are you a New England Patriots fan?
242,lol no I am not.  Did you know there is no written rule against female players?  women are allowed to play football.,And sorry, yes I watch football. I am not a fan of the Patriots either! lol I did know about the rule allowing female players. I'm surprised no females play tho
243,George rr martin calls the Patriots the lannisters of football lol,Haha that is hilarious! I agree with George RR Martin! Did you know that the highest scoring game in football was 222-0? That blows my mind!
244,Yeah thats pretty crazy,  that is a devasting loss.,It certainly is! I can't imagine being the losing team. I can't fathom any team scoring 222 points tho either!
245,I know right.  I hope they use that game as a training to never suffer that embarrassing moment again lol,Haha I hope so too! I'm surprised that espn won an emmy for creating the yellow line representing the first down. I had no clue!
246,That is cool.  I also didnt know that the NFL uses tracking chips on the players,Oh wow, I didn't know that either. It certainly seems like a lot of science and tech are involved in the game.
247,yeah technology has contributed a lot to it,  now they have all that fancy stuff on the tv for people at home.  They can draw on the screen and light up certain parts.  I heard there was once a coach that was a physics teacher.,That's really interesting. And yea, they can certainly do all kinds of things for the viewers at home to see. I've heard that nfl engineers make more in their lifetime than the nfl players. That's hard to believe given how much the players gets paid!
248,I know right.  Ridonkulous amount of money! id rather be the engineer,  less injuries lol   In the 60s bowlers used to make more than nfl football players lol,Haha yea I rather be the engineer too! And wow, bowlers?! No way! Haha
249,I guess football wasnt very popular back then lol,I guess. I know my grandparents were very serious bowlers haha They only brought home trophies, not cash tho!
250,Same here,  my grandparents are big into bowling,  a lot of trophies,  my dad is in a league but its just for fun,That's cool. I always thought it was fun to go bowling.
251,How's it going, do you follow football? Depending on the country it could refer to rugby or soccer,Love NFL football!
252,Me too,glad espn invented the yellow first down line for games, makes watching it so much better,Espn won emmy for that
253,Yea, that's pretty cool. Kinda funny that a 3 hour football game only has an average of 11 minutes of gameplay,I did not know that 14 of the 25 largest stadium belong to college football
254,I wonder if the University Iowa stadium is on that list, funny enough the painted the visitors locker room pink,Not that pink is for females only but there is no rule against a female playing
255,Since theres no rules against female players I wonder if there will be a female placekicker in the nfl soon,I think we would need to see one in college or Canadian first.
256,I think there was already one in college called Cumberland, they lost to Georgia Tech 222-o,Wow, lucky for the Patriots that happened a long time ago.
257,I'm not a big patriot fan, they are the Lannisters of the NFL,I think they cheated the Raiders with the tuck rule, they underinflated balls, and they recorded others practices.  Who knows what else?
258,Belichick is considered the coach with the most post season wins in history,I did not know belichick coached the browns.
259,Yea and Belichick even won a postseason game with the Browns,His only other playoff win with another team.
260,It's crazy that the Bills and Patriots have each lost 4 Super Bowls,All of their wins and losses were by 3 or 4 points too
261,Hello, What's your favorite football team?,Hey! I have always like the Dallas Cowboys!
262,Did you know that the highest score ever in a football game happened in 1916, when Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland 222-0,Holy cow that's a high score!!! They must have been scoring everytime they touched the ball!
263,haha Probably, I bet Cumberland university will never forget that game,I bet not.I know I wouldn't if I played for them. I heard the average lifetime earnings for an NFL player is lower than that of an engineer
264,really, that's interesting. In addition to that, top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars in the 60's.,Football is a fun sport, but with the relatively low pay and the injury rate, it makes me wonder why people would want to do it.
265,Yeah I'm not sure,did you know that the locker room for visiting football teams is completely Pink at the University of Iowa.,HAHAHA! Now that is hilarious! What an awesome thing to do! lol
266,ahaha it is funny,I will definitely look it up.,Bill Belichick is the winningest NFL postseason coach. No wonder with the Patriots!
267,Yeah he had 20 wins with the Patriots. The author of games of thrones called the new England Patriots the NFL's Lannisters.,Eww, incest galore!
268,excuse me?,The Lannister reference...it's from Game of Thrones, and that family was incestual to keep the blood line "pure"
269,Oh ok, I'm sorry I didn't understand. The new Orleans saints cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as NFL players.,Well that's crazy! I'd say it was sexist, but there isn't any rule in the NFL that females can't play.
270,yeah that's right, well It's been nice talking with you.,You too!
271,Good morning! Did you know that the NFL has no official rule against female players?,I have heard that before.I wonder if any women will be able to make the NFL one day.
272,I wonder. And what it could be the Saints! And they wouldn't be allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the cheerleaders!,I'm not really into NFL. Maybe it's because there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay in each game.
273,Yes, I've had the same reaction to it. These days, there are too many ads and too much commentary with not enough action.,But NFL has become so popular over the years. In the 60s, top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars.
274,Yes! I wonder why. Were both sports televised? Was pay based on live attendance too? It's hard to imagine bowling being as popular to watch on TV or as a live spectator.,I believe bowling was televised. My dad told me he used to watch it on TV
275,Fascinating! Well, it's still televised. I wonder if the ratings really were higher than for football or if pay was based on something else.,But even today, NFL players don't make as much on average as I would think. Engineers earn more over a lifetime.
276,Yes, and it's interesting to consider the lifetime career of a football player. Some use their background to transition to other fields such as coaching, or use the income to start a new career after they retire. Sadly, others suffer injuries that limit the options they have later on.,It's amazing how much technology is used in the NFL these days
277,Yes, I was reading about the chips that they're using in shoulder pads. I hope the data they gather that way will be used to prevent injuries.,And it's interesting how ESPN won an Emmy for that yellow line they created.
278,Yes, just a yellow line! I wonder if an Emmy has ever been awarded for something so simple.,It is very helpful to view football though.
279,Yes. A simple thing can make a huge difference.,Yes, most of the best inventions are very simple. Do you like the Patriots?
280,Yes! Go Pats! I've never been to Gillette Stadium, but I've seen many games on TV.,Bill Belichick has the most wins in NFL postseason football-20 with the Patriots and 1 with the Cleveland Browns.
281,Do you watch the NFL?,NFL? You mean the National Football League?
282,Yeah, do you watch it?,Television was forbidden in my house growing up, so I did not get much chance to watch. What about you?
283,OMG, that is so weird. Yeah, of course I do.,Oh, ok then. I guess we all have different childhoods. The TV is an influence on the mind. What do you like about the NFL football?
284,It's interesting to watch while you drink beer in a bar.,Oh, ok, it's an alcoholic event. I see. With the shouting and cheering and whatnot. Do you have a favorite team or player? I guess there are a bunch of teams.
285,Yup, good time. Of course, the Redskins, great team to follow. Lots of fun.,The Redskins? Are they named after the Native Americans?
286,Yeah, they are. They have been DC's team for a long long time.,Why the Redskins though? Isn't that a name to mock the American Indians?
287,Why are they named that? They were named that before I was born. They were named that 90 years ago I think.,Oh, ok. I thought that a team in Washington would have a very American name, like the Patriots or something.
288,Nope, they've been named that for a long time. I've never followed much of the naming conventions.,I see. I guess people choose the name that suits the spirit of the team or the town. I have never been to Washington DC, but I imagine there must be lots of Native peoples there.
289,I'm not sure, but their baseball team is named the Nationals if that helps. I think the Patriots are named that because New England was one of the first states, right?,I did not know there was a state named New England. I've heard of New York and New Hampshire.
290,Interesting, I should clarify, so New England isn't a state, it is a region where the first settlers were or something like that.,Oh, I see. That is the place of the Patriots. I think that NFL football is an interesting lesson in US history.
291,I hear the Bears may have the highest paid Defensive player in the history of the game.,Yes and he is amazing. They have been comparing Khalil Mack to Lawrence Taylor.
292,Taylor changed the way the game was played. You think he has that in him?,He definitely looked impressive this year. He earned the pay he received. He is the highest paid defensive player in the history of the game now.
293,Did you know that the Iowa State Universities coach had the visiting football teams locker rooms painted pink. Talk about mind games.,I did not. What a strange thing to do. Speaking of football, did you know that in the 1960's top bowlers made more than top football players?!
294,Wow, drink beer and bowl fro millions, Sign me up coach. Hey do you know what the highest scored college game was.,I do not. What is it?
295,Well the score was 220-0 in favor of Georgia Tech over Cumberland.,What?! How is a score that high even possible?
296,I don't know but i would not have wanted to be on the buss ride home.,No kidding. Did you know that ESPN won an Emmy for the creation of the yellow line that marks the first down? Could you imagine not having that on screen?
297,I can't they deserved it, that thing made life more manageable, lol! You know the Patriots had a RB that never fumbled the football in his career?,I did not. That's amazing. Do you remember his name by any chance?
298,Benjarvus Green-ellis former patriot.,I will have to look into him. I do not remember the name. Speaking of the Patriots, did you know that George RR Martin called them the Lannisters of the NFL? I don't see that as being a compliment ha ha.
299,Wow! well the Patriots have something in common with the Buffalo Bills they both have the same number of losses in the super bowl.,Oh wow. Everyone always talks about their wins but I did realize they were also tied for losses.
300,The Cleveland Browns last play-off game was in 1995.,They have been awful for a long time. They seem to be better the last year.
301,How do you feel about the patriots winning another super bowl?,I feel let down and aggravated to be honest.  It almost makes me want to boycott Gillette since they sponsor them.  How do you feel?
302,I hate it because they are so good. Belichick is the winningest coach in post season history.,Yeah I know. I can't help but wonder if he cheats in some way.  On the ironic side though, they patriots are tied with the bills for the most losses at super bowls.
303,They are really good at thinking outside the box. Cheating or not. They let the giants score near the end of super bowl 46 so they would have a chance. Although it backfired on them,Did you know that Bill Belichick used to coach for the cleveland browns and that their last playoff win was when he was their coach?
304,Its his only playoff win not for the patriots. So crazy we could of had a browns dynasty instead,I know. We may still yet if Baker Mayfield has his way.  Football is so popular and important that it's hard to believe that back in the 1960's bowlers made more than football players.
305,Even more surprising is that the average life earnings of an engineer is higher than that of an nfl player,Now that is surprising.  I always assumed players were among the super rich.  I would think that Benjarvus Green-Ellis would especially be super rich.  He has never fumbled the ball in his career and he's a running back.
306,I wonder if they could use those tracking chips to learn how he never fumbled. That's very impressive,It really is and surprising. I had no idea until recently that the nfl put tracking chips in players shoulder pads.
307,It records a lot of stuff! they even use them in the balls themselves,I've heard that.  I guess that's how they knew Brady was cheating that time.  You know they do all of this studying and stuff and in reality a game only has 11 minutes of actual game playing.
308,That's really crazy. I wonder how much game time the 1916 game between Georgia tech and Cumberland had,Why, did that game last a really long time or something?
309,Yes, Georgia Tech set the highest score ever at 222,Oh my! i bet it did go on forever!  What was the other team's score?
310,Cumberland did not score. It must have been pretty embarrassing. There should have been a mercy rule,With that kind of score I definitely agree.  I guess Cumberland not only had no defense but no offense as well.
311,Hello! Are you a big football fan? :),Hi there, I am a fan, but not a huge fan, I do follow my team closely though.  How about you?
312,I used to be more into it when I was younger. I lived in Louisiana for a while so it's funny they brought up the Saints. What's your team?,I am from Wisconsin, so I follow the Packers, we didn't even make the playoffs this year, so disappointing.
313,I bet! The packers fans seem to be really into football, very dedicated to their team. Have you been to any NFL or college games? I've passed by the super dome in Louisiana.,I have been to a few games, and I have been to Louisiana and saw the super dome as well.  I would like to go back there now that I am older.
314,That would be fun! It's crazy to think about how many people have been to that super dome, Tom Brady has probably been there a bunch.,Yeah I know he has won a few games there.  Did you know he was picked 19th back in the 2000 NFL draft?
315,I did not! He's been around for a while, I'm surprised he hasn't retired yet. His history as a football player is impressive. Been to the super bowl 8 times with the patriots.,Yeah he sure has, I don't think he will retire for at least two more seasons.
316,Wow, he's trying to hang around for a while. I don't blame him though, I kind of wish Peyton Manning stayed around for a while longer, I liked him.,Yeah he was a really good quarterback as well, I thought he was pretty funny as well.
317,Something that was funny to me while reading these articles is that Tom Brady has never eaten a strawberry before lol I wonder what's so scary about a strawberry,That is insane, I don't know how you can be as old as he is and not eat a strawberry.
318,Yeah, a lot of weird things about food in these articles actually. It said in the factual section 2 that New Orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any NFL player, if a NFL player comes into the restaurant they have to leave. That's crazy.,That is crazy, that rule seems so outdated and silly.  Imagine a cheerleader getting up and leaving.
319,That would be sad, if I was a cheerleader and had to leave I would at least want to finish my meal first. Double standards really.,Yeah it really is double standards and that type of thing is old and not normal anymore.
320,Maybe in 2019 they'll change that. I've heard that cheerleaders don't make very much money either, which is a shame because they put a lot of work into keeping their bodies pretty much perfect.,Yeah that is also a shame when you consider how much players make.
321,Well it's been nice talking to you! I hope the rest of your day goes well!,Same here, I hope you have a good night.
322,Hello! So do you follow football?,Hi! I do occasionally, usually during big games like Super Bowl.
323,Me too, I really don't watch much but I do like football. I think Tom Brady is an excellent quarterback.,I agree, though he is now in his 40s born in August 1977. Wonder if he might retire soon?
324,Hmmm, good question. He has done so much and considered the best quarterback of all time, so maybe. I think he is due some time to have some fun the rest of his life! The NFL probably won't want him to retire any time soon ,lol......,Not if they are smart. He is one of only 2 players in NFL history to have won 5 Super Bowls. Well, I guess it would be 6 now.
325,Right? I bet he has more time before he moves on. Football would not be the same for awhile. But as all football players retire another one comes along.,That is true. He won't be easy to forget though especially to Pats fans. He has QB'd them to 8 Super Bowls, the most of any player in history.
326,Wow, I didn't know that. I like the Patriot's. But you are right they will never be the same. Just like another Pat's player, Benjarvus Green Ellis....never fumbled a football his entire NFL career.,Yeah that's amazing. Hey, did you realize that the average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live game play?
327,It does? That is crazy! The game seems to last a very long time, but they do stop a lot. Kinda crazy, just like how an engineer makes more money in their lifetime than an NFL player, but Nfl players probably work fewer years than an engineer.,Yeah and engineering requires a lot of knowledge and schooling. Back in the 60's top bowlers made 2x as much as top football players. That is very surprising to me.
328,Wow...that is nuts! Never would think that lol, Maybe the next big star will be a female since the Nfl have no written rules against females as long as all requirements are met. Ya never know.,That would be different. Maybe they could get a pink locker room like the Univ of Iowa has for its visiting football teams. :) So bad!!
329,Haha, right! That is crazy. It's not any different than the crazy high score game that ended with 222-0 that's unbelievable!,Yeah that was awful for the losing team I bet. They probably could have benefited from the tracking chips they use today in the players' shoulder pads to record their moves. Maybe could have figured out what they were doing wrong.
330,Exactly! Good point. Did you know Tom Brady's wife makes more than twice the amount of money that Tom does?? He could definitely retire hahaa, that's a lot of money!,Yeah but very few has her body and talents so alas they play football or work regular ole jobs. LOL
331,Hahaha, I don't even know what she does but wow, that's still a lot of money.,She's a Brazilian model (Victoria's Secret) and one of the highest paid in the world. She and Brady make a pretty cool team though both deserve what they work hard for.
332,Hi, do you like football?,I love the sport, do you have a favorite team? AFC or NFC?
333,NFC and the Bears. You?,AFC and the New England Patriots
334,Nice! You've had a great run lately then. Did you celebrate their SB win?,No, not really, Bill Belichick got served, that is a sure thing but other than that I have no idea
335,I thought Bill had a great game plan. He limited the offensive genius to like 3 points.,Yeah the game was a bit boring though, I thought it was going to have more action in it
336,It was boring but Bill usually wins the boring ones. There is only 11 minutes of play so maybe that is why.,I guess better to win in a boring way than to lose in an exiting form, and 11 minutes don't seem like much
337,Yeah, as a bears fan, I just want wins! I could use like a decade of them like you guys.,Yeah we have been pretty lucky and then theres also Brady, his a good luck charm
338,I know, plus he's dreamy! I mean, that's a good looking dude.,I have to give it to him, great athlete and also has a smoking hot wife so he has just about everything in life
339,Don't you kind of hate those guys? Good at everything and has everything? At least I have eaten strawberries!,I kind of do, I wish I had a 30th part of what he has or even less lol, and that is weird, how can he not like strawberries or even try them
340,Going back to his youth, he never had a strawberry? If not, he is seriously missing out. I had a strawberry protein shake this morning, made with real strawberries!,Strawberries are so tasty, I couldn't  live without them.  He has a good TD pass record though.
341,Yeah, I remember that Randy Moss season with 50 TDs and it was magical!,And prior to that season he never threw 30 TD passes in a season so yeah magical
342,Do you think Tom Brady is really ready to retire?,I don't know. The consensus among the experts seems to be that he'll keep playing.
343,Why is that?  His wife makes a ton of money, too.,Yeah, and he's been spending a lot of time on his charity work. Football doesn't seem to be his main priority.
344,Yet, he continues.  His buddy Gronk may also retire.,Yes, I heard that too.
345,With three kids and a supermodel wife, why take a chance on getting permanently hurt?,Right, and he's been talking about wanting to be there for his family more.
346,Plus his training "guru" Guerrero was kicked off the Patriots' campus.,Yes, and that's caused some tensions within the team.
347,I think the Pats made a mistake trading away Jimmy Garoppolo.,Yes! I agree!
348,He is doing very well in SF... when he isn't hurt.,Did you know that the NFL has no written rule against female players? Women would in fact be allowed if they met the league's eligibility requirements.
349,A few women have played in college, mainly in non-contact positions.,I did not know that! I wonder how many have tried out for the NFL.
350,I don't think any have tried.  It would have been big news.,Yeah. I wonder if it will ever happen.
351,My son's modified grade 8 has a girl playing the offensive line.  She was actually the smallest lineman, but played with great technique and was fearless, she was well respected.,That's awesome! Good for your son's team!
352,Hi, do you like football?,Yes I enjoy the game. I like the NFL even though there's only 11 minutes alive gameplay.
353,That seems short. Do you know there is no rule against females playing?,Yes as long as they meet the league's eligibility requirements they can play! I would like to see a girl play.
354,They cannot eat in the same place as the players, at least the Saints cheerleaders.,That is a weird rule. How did they enforce the rules of the cheerleaders being required to leave?
355,Asked politely? I would be upset if I were a cheerleader! Like I would lose all of my inhibitions and just hook up with a player at the restaurant. That's a little demeaning...,Yes that's a very good point. Maybe the NFL tracks cheerleaders just like it tracks players movements on the field.
356,I really hope not! That's really disturbing! Kinda stalker-ish.,Yes it would be I'm sure they don't do that. Although they do track the balls to measure velocity, rotation, Ball Speed, and location.
357,That makes sense to me. It would be helpful in assessing the QBs.,Yes it definitely would be. I wonder what Tom Brady's football stats are like? He is definitely one of the best as he is 5 super bowls.
358,He's been pretty good! All time great! Do you have a favorite team?,Definitely not the patriots LOL! What about you? Tom Brady has never eaten a strawberry and his entire life. He is missing out.
359,I am a Bears fan. I don't mind the Pats...,Oh Chicago has a dedicated Fan base for sure. Soldier Field would be a fun place to watch a game. Before 2007 Tom Brady had never thrown 30 touchdown passes in a season.
360,Then he got Randy Moss and blew that out of the water!,Yup real talk! Tom Brady's wife makes double her husbands salary!
361,I would be really happy if my wife made double what I make. That would be great!,Yes me too. Maybe some day...I also find it funny Brady was drafted in the 6th round in 2000.
362,I heard that Rob Gronkowski might be leaving the Patriots.,Wow, is it because Gronk is such a carefree, happy guy?
363,Well, I think he's been a great player but he's had a rough few seasons due to his health.,Oh, that's true. I don't think he's played all 16 games for a long time!
364,Yeah since like 2011 I think! But I'm sure Belichick will make the best decision as his coach.,Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of the Patriots, but I admit that Belichick knows what he's doing. Besides, Robert Kraft has said a lot of admirable things about Gronkowski.
365,Yeah and about Belichick too - he called him the greatest coach in the history of coaching. That's a pretty big compliment.,He is, but I guess it doesn't hurt to have Tom Brady on the team. Geez, I think he's one of only two NFL players to win 5 Super Bowls!
366,Wow! I didn't realize that there were only two. He's married to Gisele Bundchen right?,In all honestly though, I do think it's a great story that he was picked 199th in the draft, but he never lost faith in himself and ended-up being one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time!
367,That is really unbelievable about the draft. The Patriots got SO lucky. He's had the most Super Bowl appearances of any player in history!,I know! And Brady won the Super Bowl in the first year he was a starter!
368,Wasn't the only other quarterback to do that Kurt Warner?,I think you're right! You know what else is crazy? Six of Tom Brady's Super Bowls were decided by 3 or 4 points!
369,Wow! Those are close games. Do you know if he won any championships when he played college football for the University of Michigan?,I think he was on the bench when Michigan won the Rose Bowl and Championship, but a lot of people still think he was the biggest steal in the history of the NFL!
370,Well I guess he and Gronk have made some pretty big impact on the Patriots.,Yeah, I think it's safe to say Brady won't be shown the door like Ty Law, Richard Seymour, Randy Moss and Chandler Jones!
371,Yeah, agreed! The Patriots haven't been one of the greatest teams in the NFL because Belichick held on to players for too long, at least.,Yep. The guy makes a lot of tough moves, and isn't sentimental about his roster. Even after losing last year, I still think they have a shot again this year.
372,Absolutely! No matter what you think about the Patriots, Belichick is excellent at putting together an award-winning roster.,All true! I guess Belichick has the football knowledge and expertise that no one else has!  They're still in first place...again, so you never know!
373,Do you know anything about the Pro Football Hall of Fame?,Only slightly. Why, what's up?
374,Just curious.    Been reading about Ray Lewis and Canton.,Oh yeah! The name Ray Lewis rings a bell! Have you read anything interesting about him?
375,He had an emotional story about his mother during his induction.,Aw, that's sweet! What happened to his mother? Do you know?
376,I believe she is still alive.     He told stories of growing up in poverty and how this moment was "Momma, we made it!",Oh that is so heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time! I remember who he is now! The guy that got inducted into the pro football hall of fame! It's so touching to see someone speaking of their mother as he did in his speech!
377,Are you a fan of the 32 teams in the NFL?    Any particular one?,I'm not really a big fan of any of them. I guess if I had to choose I'd pick the Seahawks because I love Seattle! Haha. Does that count? And do you have a favorite team?
378,I like the New Orleans Saints, even though their cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same resrauarant as any NFL player.,Oh I've heard about that! Can you believe if one of the Saints cheerleaders is eating in ANY restaurant and ANY NFL player comes in, she has to get up and leave? What is going on with that! It's terrible!
379,I wonder if the rule would apply if there were a female NFL player.    I don't believe there is any gender rule in the league.,Nope! I've heard that if a female made certain qualifications, then she could 100% join the NFL! I mean, it kind of tempts me to try it!
380,One or two might work, Cumberland lost 222-0 in 1916.,Oh wow, that is quite the loss! I've never heard about that game before! Here is a fun thing I was reading about that's very related! Those big American flags at football stadiums weigh 1,100 pounds and cost $50,000 to make! What a waste of money! That money could really help so many people!
381,Well, times, people and things change.    In the 1960's, football stars made half as much as top bowlers!,Oh wow! I've never bowled, never in my life. I wonder how much they make today compared to one another. Hey do you like any country music? I like some, like Dolly Parton. I was just reading about how country music was inspired by Celtic music. I think that's neat!
382,That is very cool, although it is a little sad there are only two African Americans in the Country Music Hall of Fame.,Absolutely. I've heard that country music used to be called "hillbilly" music! Good thing they changed the name! I think it was Connie B. Gay who coined the actual term "country music".
383,Now many people love it!    Even rock stars U2 opened for themselves as the Dalton Brothers from Galveston Texas!,Oh that is so cool! What a unique thing to do! Opening for yourself as another band! Very interesting! Oh, haha! Did you hear about a 1996 album called "NFL Country"? NFL players sang along with country music stars. I'd love to hear that!
384,Pretty cool.     I think I will go see if it is on Amazon.    Need to help out George Strait's cousin!,Haha. Yeah I feel like listening to some Dolly Parton now. It was great chatting with you!
385,hello, let's discuss football.,Can you believe Brady's JV high school football coach refused to play him?
386,really? why? I haven't heard about that.. I adored Italian A serie when i was a teenager,Who is your favorite qb?
387,Alessandro Nesta, I also liked Paulo Maldini aand Francesco Totti lol.. btw have you heard that Espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line for american football games?,Yes, it was pretty ingenious. Now they have the Field goal attempt line too right?
388,I  can't even imagine lol and also The highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 222-0, I was shocked, how is that even possible,I find it funny that the visitor's locker room at Iowa University was painted pink...lol
389,lol yes it is funny. who is you favorite quarterback?,Im a huge fan of Baker Mayfield because he likes Halo 3 like me
390,wow so cool,  and do you like Alex Smith? I learned that Alex smith took so many ap tests in high school that he entered university as a junior. the quarterback received his bachelor's degree in two years, and began working on a master's degree, before becoming the first overall pick in the 2005 nfl draft.,Did you catch his gruesome leg injury a couple of weeks ago?
391,no. Did you know the fact that Kellan moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl?,I thought there were other left handed QBs before?
392,No he is the only one. Which is your favorite drama movie or book?,I really like Sicario
393,I like A walk to remember, my childhood favorite movie. Hugh laurie is the highest paid actor ever for tv drama, earning $700,000 per episode in house, it is very interesting to know,What tv drama does he act in?
394,I don't like his movies to be honest. One more celebrity news is that actor Michael caine became an actor because all the prettiest girls at his school were in drama class.,Michael is one of my all-time favorite actors!
395,Really? Which drama movies of him do you like>,The comedy in which he costars with Steve Martin in Scoundrels
396,do you watch the NFL?,yes, do you know who kellan moore is?
397,I have heard of him. DO you like Brady?,I do. Moore is the only QB that is left handed
398,Oh cool. Brady in high school was the resevre QB that never got started,Wow they sure lost talent there. Did you know Brad Johnson threw himself a touchdown?
399,What, how is that even possible?,Exactly why he down in history for being the only one to do it
400,Yeah I guess. Do you know ALex Smith finished college in two years?,No really? THat smart? Do you like drama?
401,I do. Have you ever seen House MD?,I have it is a good show. Do you know JOn Hamm?
402,Laurie made $700 000 per episode, Yes I like Hamm,That is a lot, Hamm was a drama teacher and one of his students was Ellie Kemper
403,Haha they are both too funny.. Do you listen to radio dramas?,Sometimes they can be interesting and you?
404,Yes and if you are interested there is a free website for them,Oh that is so nice and convenient and free
405,Yeah it is. DO you know why Michael Caine became an actor?,I have no idea, how? DId tou know Patrick Stewart teaches masters classes in drama in the UK?
406,Do you watch football?,Heck yeah but not lately since the season is over. I only watch American football though.
407,Yea, that best kind lol. Do you watch both college and nfl?,Yeah but more NFL. I do like college once in a while though. The highest score ever in a football game occurred between Georgia Tech and Cumberland. It was 222 to 0.
408,That is an insane score. I wonder if they had a mercy rule created after that game lol. I would have quit at 100-0!,Yeah seriously. Well I don't think would have been in modern times because this occurred back in 1916.
409,wow, that was a long time ago. My favorite team is the Iowa Hawkeyes, heard of them?,Iowa State right? Is it true about their locker room?
410,University of Iowa, different college. It is very true, pink and everything,Oh that's right! Wow that is funny and very dramatic? Do you like the drama genre?
411,It is for psychology purposes. It is a calming color. I love some drama shows like House, you?,Oh interesting. House is awesome because of Hugh Laurie. Makes sense he makes 700,000 per episode.
412,that was so much money per episode. He made the show awesome for sure!,Yes no doubt about that. He is the highest paid actor for any tv drama!
413,That is awesome, definitely worth the money! Do you have a favorite quarterback?,My favorite QB is Baker Mayfield. So glad he didn't go pro in video gaming!
414,I am glad too, I think I could have beat him in halo 3. Makes a better qb lol,I would like to see that match up! Kellan Moore is the only left handed QB in the NFL!
415,i enjoyed the michael vick before the arrest, he was my all time favorite lefty. It was nice chatting with you!,Oh yeah I forgot about him. Alex Smith is good too which is no surprise that he is very smart! Nice talking with you as well.
416,Not sure how much longer Football will exist in it's current form.,the game has caused a lot of injury. it is hard to know who is at fault. there are risks. its obvious.
417,I guess the question is how much the NCAA officials knew about the potential for serious damage and injury.,they might not have know exactly but they feared the possibility. too much money at stake to stop the game. too much liability to admit fault.
418,Money, money, money. Maybe it's time to go to flag football.,yes, then the whole thing could be co-ed. i wish the players had better representation in college. no one helps them.
419,Yeah, just kids really. I've got boys but have never encouraged them to play tackle football. Playing it before 12 has a lot of risks.,sports are important but most do not involve such risk of injury. basketball soccer baseball tennis swimming the list is endless. plenty of ways to compete. youre wise to protect your kids.
420,Yeah, we've done swimming, basketball etc.,thats good. still, the country is dedicated to gridiron gladiators. 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums belong to american college football teams.
421,It's a big sport for sure with so much money. An average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay. Lots of commercials in there.,The high school football stadium in allen, texas seats 18,000 and cost $60 million to build. i guess the pros have similar stadiums. all for 11 minutes of gameplay. i wonder if schools will ever get money like that.
422,Dunno, the average NFL player doesn't make that much money in the long run. Careers are too short.,true, plus they dont know how to manage money. no control no financial knowledge. i figure they should get help from the league.
423,Yeah, they should. Financial education is critical. I'm more of a literature person personally.,yes, you would need financial education then if you were a player. why was literature in the olympics?
424,No idea. I guess they were going for a full spread of culture or something. Hear about the contest to come up with the worst possible opening sentence in a novel?,It was a dark and stormy night. suddenly a shot rang out. good stuff! i figure i could be good at being terrible.
425,LOL, that would be a lot of fun.,Comedic fantasy author terry pratchett was knighted for his "services to literature". i wonder what kind of horrible opening lines he could come up with. Anyway, great chat!
426,Do you like watching football?,I love watching it!  How about you?
427,I love it also! Do you have a favorite college and NFL team?,I would have to say out of the 42 teams in the NFL the Steelers are my favorite.
428,Nice, I like the vikings. I like the University of Iowa Hawkeyes for college, have you heard of them?,I have!  I like how they painted their visitors locker room pink.  lol
429,Right, it is so interesting to see. Apparently pink is a calming color and why they do it lol,I could see that.  In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars of the day!  Times have sure changed since then.
430,Times have changed for sure! I wonder what the difference is now in salary, has to be a ton,I be it's reveresed!  Do you know what the higest score ever was in a football game?  Hint it was in 1916 and Georgia Tech beat Cumberland.
431,what was the score to that 80-0?,It was actually 222-0.  What a blowout.
432,no way! That would be insane. I would have quit football right after the game if I was cumberland, wow!,lol Did you know that ESPN won an emmy for creating the superimposed yellow first down line on tv?  I had no idea.
433,I did not know that either. I love that line, it is so helpful. I used to think it was real growing up.....,lol Nice!  How about former Patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis?  He's never fumbled the ball once during his career!
434,That is a great feat! He needs to teach a clinic to these new RBs,I agree!  What do you think of the tracking chips that they are putting in the players shoulder pads and footballs to track data?
435,I think it is awesome. Must be developed by engineers who make more money than players over their life time. It was nice chatting with you!,That's probably due to their longer careers.  Did you know that the NFL only has 11 minutes of live gameplay?  I had fun!  Thanks!
436,Are you a fan of football?,I'm a huge football fan. How about yourself?
437,I love football both college and NFL, do you have a favorite NFL team of the 32?,I'm a New England Patriots fan and huge fan of Tom Brady how about you?
438,Nice I am a Vikings fan, not doing so hot as of late. I also like the University of Iowa Hawkeyes, did you know they paint their opponents locker room pink?,No I didn't know this. Did you know that in the 60's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football players?
439,That is crazy to think, I wonder what the difference in salary is now, probably substantial,Now there is no contest football players make way more than bowlers that's for sure. What do you think about the new rule that was implemented by the NFL?
440,Which rule is that?,Its the rule that a player can't lower his helmet and initiate contact with an opposing player.
441,That is a good player because of safety concerns, but also was awesome to see back in the day when it was allowed. How do you feel about it,I think it will decrease injuries and I think its a great rule because it protects the football players from serious head injuries.
442,For sure, that is a huge problem now. Did you know engineers make more money in their lifetime than NFL players,I didn't know this but its an interesting fact. What year did the NFL and the AFL merge?
443,I am not sure, do you know? Wasn't Trump an owner of an AFL team?,The merger between the two leagues was completed in 1970. I'm not sure if Donald Trump was an owner of an AFL team.
444,I think he maybe was for another league, seems like new ones are coming out every year now. Being youre a patriots fan, did you like benjarvus green ellis?,I loved benjarvus green elis and I read somewhere that he never fumbled in his career.
445,Right, that is outstanding in my opinion. He needs to teach a clinic to all these new era RBs! It was so great chatting with you!,It was awesome chatting with you as well. You have a nice day!!!
446,Trump and Stone knew very well what Wikileaks had in their hands with those emails,Is that a fact?
447,I think the email to Bannon back in October proves it.,Fake news!
448,But a copy of the email was published by NY times and Daily Caller, how fake can it be?,Haha - just as telephone, or phone, is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be heard directly, those two rags can perpetrate nonsense. Right?
449,Mueller has the evidence as well as the focus to shed the necessary light on the actual truth of the matter,I'm looking forward to the conclusion!
450,The conclusion of collusion...lol,I like the rhyme! Did you know the that the last us president to speak a foreign language fluently was fdr?
451,I did not know that.,Oh sure and everyone thinks Trump is illegitimate president because he didn't get the popular vote but 5 presidents have been elected while still losing the popular vote. greatest margin 10%!
452,I would have liked to see the runner up last election be the VP to bring some order to this chaos as of late.,Well sure and I would've like it to be Bill Murray because he DID voice the human torch in the 1970's fantastic four radio show.
453,The canadian radio shows have to play at least 40 percent of canadian music which means tons of Justin Bieber,Egad - he's not my favorite!
454,My grandfather once told me a story about how he had made his first radio with only a razorblade and a pencil,Is your grandfather MacGyver?
455,no, many soldiers during that time did the same thing,WOW! Cool like the fact that one of the most popular radio acts of the 1930s was a ventriloquist, a fact which baffled contemporary critics.
456,Have you checked out the free classical dramas on the radio,Like old ones or present day?
457,old classical ones,Merry Christmas? Let's finish this thing so that I can go check them out!
458,Time to listen to my radio,indeed!
459,I would have to say that the telephone is one of the most important devices ever invented. Where would we be without telecommunications.,For sure.  Did you watch the State of the Union last night delivered by President Trump?  Surprisingly he is not one of the three wealthiest presidents in American history.
460,Well, his net worth may well be negative. President Banana fo Zimbabwe probably had more moneof,Possibly.  JFK, Jefferson, and Washington certainly had more.  They are the three wealthiest presidents in history.
461,Well, the President of Indonesia has done 3 pop albums. That sounds like something up President Trump's alley.,Did you know until 1805 the runner up in the election became vice president.  Can you imagine Trump working with Hillary?
462,I did not know that. Who would get the guest house?,Not sure, good question.  I know it's larger than the white house which is ironic.
463,But its not in NYC. So it would take longer to dial it up, at least on a rotary phone.,Right, because NYC's area code is 212.  I get it.
464,It doesn't matter on an iphone though, which is more powerful in some ways that the entire US Nuke deterrent system.,That's amazing.  And all of that computing power dependent on a 2.7 ich cable laying across the ocean floor.
465,Back in the day, WW2 soldiers could make radios using a razorblade and pencil. They were probably more secure than todays devices.,Most likely.  Hard to hack a razor blade I suppose.  I bet those soldiers were strong, but not strong enough to separate two phone books joined together with overlapped pages.
466,Was Helen Sloane Dudman strong enough to do that? She bought 3 radio stations. That's impressive.,Yeah, that does sound impressive.  I wonder if she ever listened to one of the thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas online.
467,I think she preferred Nuntii Latini.,Kinda like Canadians prefer Canadian radio.  They require at least 40% of the music played to be Canadian.
468,No wonder the President of Indonesia couldn't get any airplay!,Either that or he wasn't very good.
469,He was no President Banana.,That's for sure.  Well, pleasure chatting with you.
470,Hello. How are you?,I'm doing well, you listen to the radio very much?
471,yes Even more so when I am driving,Me too, I'm surprised that Jupiter has radio storms they can be heard on AM radio.
472,Yes. I wouldnt mind hearing those.,I wonder what they sound like? What if it is actually aliens trying to talk with us?
473,I dont think those sounds are from Aliens.  But they have picked up sounds from space that make me wonder,For sure, did you see in Canada, 40% of the songs played have to be Canadian? That's pretty wild.
474,I am surprised by that,I'm sure this will blow you away too, in WW2, soldiers made simple radios using a razorblade and a pencil.
475,I would like to google that to see how thats done.,Yah, I'm sure there is a youtube video or too on it. You ever heard of the reason why NYCs area code is 2-1-2?
476,No. I should being I have dialed it so much in my life, but I dont,It's because it's the fastest number to dial on the rotary, think about how much time you have saved because of it.
477,Wow. I never knew that.,Yah, did you know the other word for telephone is a phone?
478,Yes. I knew that one.,Do you see UNICEF donating a day of clean water to a child in need, all you need to do is not use your phone.
479,That is a great idea.,For sure, I wonder how many people do that? Any idea on why you can't separate two phonebooks that have their pages over lapped?
480,No. That seems strange.,What a mystery. Anyways, great chatting with you, hope you have a good rest of the day, I'm going to go for a walk!
481,I love to read romantic novels. What type of books do you like to read?,Yes, I love to read those romantic novels as well though I haven't done much reading lately ever since football season started and now basketball. Any favorites in particular?
482,I am a huge fan of what Sarah MacLean recommends. She's a washington post column.,Oh Ok, I'm not too familiar with her work, I'll have to look it up after the chat. I do follow a couple of sports authors and read an opinion piece on why the author thinks the University of Iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is painted pink.
483,Do you have a list of sport authors for books you have read?,I like books by Michael Lewis and Ellie Kennedy but recently there's been more debate about the dangers of football on head injuries. Those articles are really convincing, how do you feel about football?
484,I know a lot of facts about NFL and I watch the superbowl, but other than that, I'm lost for words as to why people like football. How can a game with 11 minutes of live gameplay take 3 hours of air time.,Haha, I feel the same way! It's because they need to play ads so as to beat the average lifetime earnings of engineers because supposedly their earnings are higher than the average lifetime earnings of NFL players which I find hard to believe.
485,Damn, I did not know engineers made that much. I should have gone into the STEM field back in college. That's a factoid to add to my future discussions.,Yeah, I should've done that too and if my kids ever wanted to be professional cheerleaders, I would be very opposed to it especially since the Saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as the NFL players. They're humans too!
486,That sounds like borderline discrimination but I guess they don't want the cheerleaders to influence the game. They must have had previous encounters of bad press.,Yeah or gender bias too! Not sure, I didn't read about that in the news, at least not anytime recently, I'm surprised there's no MeToo campaign surround that rule!
487,I guess it's only a #MeToo moment if they were touched. I doubt they were. I'm surprised that there's no female NFL players, since it is no written rule against this.,Good point, but there's something wrong with that rule. Yeah, but even if females can play, I'd imagine some would have a difficult time meeting the leagues physical eligibility requirements, I'm not sure what that is, do you know?
488,I don't know. There are some muscular females out there in the world. Certain some of them can give people a run for their spot.,Yeah, women can be aggressive and strategize as well! They even use tracking chips to monitor and record the players move on the field, I would love to see the data on that.
489,I wonder if that's their attempt to bring statistics into the game, similar to how baseball is all a statistical game. Sounds like some 1950 harvard mathematic research team with the latest gadgets.,Haha, that would be cool to track, like how fast a quarterback can throw a ball or the force at which someone tackles. I wonder if the player's contracts for salary are adjusted because they're either one of the fastest players or something.
490,I doubt the franchise would even know what to do with this data. A lot of them are retired football players who just knows the old fashion game play and will probably never adopt new technology.,Oh that's a good point. Besides football, I also like to watch comedies and find bromantic comedies to be especially popular and funny.
491,Yes. I love harold and kumar. I also love white castle. Maybe I should go for some white castle burgers after this.,Haha yeah! I have never had any White Castle before, though I would love to try some time after seeing their love for the burgers.
492,Hey can you guess the top 3 richest presidents in history?,I know about jefferson and wasington? WHo else is in there?
493,well I thought it would be Trump but it is actually JFK, weird!,Oh wow, I guess they had a lot of money back then. did you know the guest house is larger than the white house?
494,haha I didn't know that seems odd, also odd is the president of Zimbabwe's name is President Banana haha,yeah I wonder if that means something else in their language though
495,ya I don't know haha, I think President Banana shoudl release a pop album though like the pres. of indonesia did haha,yeah that guy honestly, a president and a pop star. wonder fi they are good
496,haha I'll have to check it out, did you know that teh runner up in the Pres. election used to become the VP? Trump and Hillary could have been in the white house together, maybe they release a pop album together? hah,hahahha that would have been funny. did you know the white house has twin buildings in ireland and france?
497,ya I think they're like twin buildings so exactly the same, do you think the interiors have similar paintings and desks or is it completely different? haha,I have no idea. and do the presidents of those countries like there too?
498,haha thats a good question, did you like Teddy Roosevelt? I think he's pretty awesome, he would wrestle wild animals haha,I heard he also banned christmas trees from the white house
499,ya he did, and he also gave a speech, got shot in the chest, and then continued giving the speech haha,pretty amazing. did you know they still use floppy discs at the white house?
500,haha I have heard they do! But they do have solar panels so at least that is somewhat advanced,yes I like that. do you watch football?
501,I watch it a bit I saw the superbowl, I was glad the Patriots won and they have a teammate who has never fumbled the ball!,yeah that is actually pretty amazing, good for him. did you know espn won and emmy?
502,I did know that, I think for that yellow line on tv? Definitely a great invention!,Yeah, that is it. nice chat
503,hi how are you? do you like football?,Sure do.    I even play fantasy football.
504,i dont know that. how does it work? do you make money?,It is certainly possible to make money.     Mostly it is a way to create interest in players on teams you do not root for such as Lamar Jackson.
505,oh,ok. are you good at this? i guess you must know the players very well then.,I know a lot about some players like Baker Mayfield on the Browns, but am not an expert.
506,baker mayfield? is he good? does he play video games?,Baker Mayfield is good.    I do not know of his video game habits.     Do you follow the real NFL?
507,i dont usually. i follow around the playoffs. i try to watch the super bowl.,The Super Bowl is usually held the first Sunday in February.
508,Yes, i was unable to watch it this year. busy. but i heard the game was not that exciting this year.,There is always some interest in the champions of the NFC and AFC playing each other.
509,i guess so. i usually root for the underdog. i like the upset. do you bet on the game?,I am not allowed to gamble because I work for a company that makes tracking chips in shoulder pads!
510,thats great! LOL. the tracking chips. can they track players off the field to make sure they dont go to the same restaurants as cheerleaders?,I would guess so, although players don't wear shoulder pads to restaurants.     Maybe ask Matt Patricia, who is both a coach and a rocket scientist.
511,the chips are only in the shoulder pads? Ok, so that won't work. Matt might have a way to keep track of those guys and their eating habits.,True.      A big change from the first nfl playoff game in 1932!
512,I think that the NFL has come a long way. The players make more, the teams are bigger, everything is bigger. A lot of injuries, though. Anyway, great chat!,Thanks!   I think I will go read up on the 32 teams in the NFL.
513,Enjoy! I'll talk to you later, I'm sure.,No problem.     RPI is a cool university!
514,Hi, how are you doing today?,I am good, thanks. I'm wondering if you are a football fan like me? I know a lot of people are sad the season is over, especially since fantasy football is such a hit.
515,I like football, but I don't get much chance to watch. usually I try to catch the SB.,What is the SB? I know if fantasy football it's all about the picks and people plan for weeks.
516,Super Bowl. Sorry, should have made that clear. I've never played fantasy sports. What's the goal? How do you win? What do you win?,Oh, duh, sorry. The goal is to draft the best team by picking members from all teams to make the best.  Did you know bowlers in the 1960's made more than NFL players?
517,I believe it. Bowlers had their golden age. Many leagues and lots of local interest. Then the modern gladiators showed up and stole the show.,Yes! I used to bowl myself on a league. I am  more of a football fan. I know former Patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis never had a fumble in his career!
518,How did he do that? special gloves? Giant hands? Did he get a bonus? I hope so!,I think just raw talent. It's hard to say if he got a bonus since the NFL has a total of 32 teams. It's hard to keep up.
519,I can't keep up. That's why I follow during the playoffs. I think that it would be interesting to see if a woman could play.,Actually, the NFL has no rules against women playing as long as they meet the league's eligibility requirements!
520,I figure that a woman could be akicker or something. They should be referees and such.,I would say. I would not want to see a man v woman contact.
521,Yes, I think it would make the viewers squeamish. Maybe women on women though. That could be fun.,I am not sure I could watch! Although the average game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay.
522,That seems short, but I guess they stand around waiting a lot. Great work, if you can get it.,Yeah, no kidding. Although the average lifetime salary of engineers is higher than the average lifetime earning of an NFL player.
523,Plus fewer concussions too. I think it would be better for women to go into engineering.,Yeah, no kidding! I know the cheerleaders on the Saints have to leave a restaurant if a team player is there.
524,Sexism, plain and simple. Anyway, great chatting!,Great chatting with you too!
525,Thanks!,Take care!
526,Are you a football fan?,A little bit, yourself?
527,Yes i find it curious that the Iowa States visiting locker room is painted pink.,i wonder if it's to intimidate the other team?
528,Maybe but that would just make me mad and focused!,The opposite of what they want! Did you see where there was once a football game score of 222-0?
529,No i never saw that game. That is ridiculous they should have a mercy rule or something. Who was that?,Georgia tech V cumberland!
530,Wow i did not hear about this game. Was it recent?,no, I think it was back in the day! Espn won an emmy for that superimposed line they use though.
531,Yeah to help viewers see where the first down line is. I love that line, haha! You know there is a RB that never fumbled the ball his entire career?,no! Who was that?
532,He's a former patriot Benjarvus Green-Ellis.,Wow! did you hear the NFL finally drafted a woman since there is no rule against it?
533,No i didn't hear the actually drafted one. Do you know who she is?,I don't. but I bet if you google you will find her! I wonder if they will use those chips in her uniform to see how she does?
534,Well the whole purpose is no discrimination so i don't see why not. They should just create a women league like the wnba.,I wonder if it would get watched? did you know a game generally only has 11 minutes of live play?
535,That's crazy and hard to believe. So there are 32 teams, do you have a favorite?,not really, I like the New orleans Saints. How bout you?
536,The team yes the rule about the cheerleaders no. Have you heard of that rule? I'm assuming it has something to do with employee fraternization?,What Rule? Great chatting with you!
537,are you a football fan,I am.  I used to watch NFL Sunday all the time.  I don't anymore though.  How about you?
538,I watch every Sunday.  it is my favorite time.  Did you know that quarterback's average passing was 93.6 now,That's really impressive.  I find it more interesting that an average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.  It's still fun to watch
539,I know.  I think because the league prefers offense over defense nowaday,I believe that. The fans want action all of the time.  Watching defensive play after defensive play can get annoying.  Also, you want point grabbers on your fantasy team too.  Defense doesn't always help you win.
540,Did you know that the university football locker room was painted in all pink,That's a great way to mess with the visiting team!  Do you play fantasy football?
541,hahaha.  Yeah, I play occasionally.  You?,I used to.  I actually used to love playing fantasy Hockey.  I was much better at that.   I never knew that ESPN won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line!  I didn't think you could win an emmy for that.
542,I did not that people fantasy draft the national spelling bee,I can see that.  I didn't know it actually existed though.  It's like in Vegas - you can bet on anything
543,Also, do you know that a single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving fantasy and reality,That is really interesting.  Almost as interesting as the fact that the Saints' cheerleaders cannot eat in the same restaurant as any NFL player
544,I think they do not want any distraction.  Hahah,Probably.  I guess it's written into their contract.
545,football players are having too much troubles already,That's true.  But it seems everyone else has to change their ways for them.
546,I believe so because money talks,It absolutely does.
547,by the way, nice chatting with you.  Happy holiday,Same to you!  Happy Holidays!
548,Good morning!  Do you follow the NFL?,I do, I even play a fantasy football game, what about you?
549,I love playing fantasy football.  Have played for bout 17 or 18 years now.  Did you know that they even have a fantasy league for congress?,I dont really know that but I do know a bit about players QB Macus Mariona is a bad choice, one of the worst QBs in the season
550,I agree.  I kind of thought he was a little overrated when he was drafted.,Yeah only 13 TD passes which is low for a QB, he did have a better season the previous year
551,Saquon Barkley should be a good pick for the fantasy draft next season.,Im not aware of that player in what position does he play?
552,He is a running back for the New York Giants.,Oh I see, he must be a great choice then so fantasy football, people seem to love fantasy leagues not only sports but just about anything
553,Yes they do.  They even have a fantasy draft for the national spelling bee.  I have no idea how that works though.,No idea either it does sound kind of boring theres even a fantasy congress league
554,I've heard about that league.  That's where players draft members of congress and points are based off legislative success.  Sounds like a snoozefest to me.,Sounds  also really boring, who knows it might be interesting, so do you also like fantasy novels?
555,Can't say that I do.  lol  Do you like them?,I do like them, interesting fact but a janitor wrote over 15,145 pages of fantasy but never published his work
556,That's a lot of writing.  I wonder why after putting all that work into it he never published it.  Maybe it was back in the days before the internet where you had to have a book deal to get published.,Maybe he didnt think his book had potential or was waiting to finish it, he died and then the piece of literature got discovered so its hard to tell now
557,I agree with you.  Did you know that a single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving reality and fantasy?,Thats interesting I didnt know that, our brain is sure full with mysteries
558,I agree!  It's been fun chatting with you!,Yeah, its also been great chatting with you, thanks for the chat.
559,Do you watch football much?,I do from time to time.
560,me too, I am a university of iowa football fan, they paint their visitors locker room pink!,That's cool.  Do you watch the NFL at all?
561,I love watching the NFL, out of the 32 teams, my favorite is the vikings, do you have a favorite?,I like the Cardinals and 49ers.
562,nice I was a 49ers fan back in the day. I loved Jerry Rice and Steve Young. Games were more exciting back then. Now gametime is only like 11 minutes of actual playing,I know! Do you follow the odds for each team winning at all"
563,I do not, what are they?,It is part of how the betting on each team is handled.  There is an over/under on each team winning.
564,Gotcha, I think your teams have low odds of winning it all currently, that may change with better picks. Did you know who benjarvus green ellis was?,I think he was a running back.  You are correct about my teams winning it all.  The Vikings do not appear to be doing to well either.
565,nope lol. Maybe Benjarvus needs to come back and teach our teams how to not fumble the ball!,LOL!  It seems when the Vikings play the Packers one should pick the Packers.  What do you think?
566,Well not now, packers are almost worst than both our teams lol! I think the vikings and 49ers could beat them 222-0 like georgia tech beat a team in 1916,I doubt it. I would say the Packers are favored over the Vikings.  I would not bet against Rogers.
567,That is true, he is pretty prime time. He is my quarterback for my fantasy football team, I can't bet against him,LOL!  Did you know that one of the most expensive high school football stadiums was built in Allen,TX?
568,I read that in an article, how much was it? that is a waste of money in my opinion!,It was $60 million.  I know that is a ton of money!  Did you also know that Snoop Dogg wrote a fight song for his son's football team?
569,Do you watch the NFL?,I do watch the NFL. I watch the Super Bowl. What about you?
570,I watched it, I thought it was boring this year. Did you know that ESPN won an emmy for the 1st down market you see on tv?,Wow that's crazy. I don't know if that's worth it any but it is certainly useful. I do like the Patriots and I guess that they have a running back was never fumbled the ball. They should give him the ball every time. Or at least I would haha
571,Yeah, me too. Hilarious, but you know there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay during a full game.,Well like you said the Super Bowl was really boring this year so that kind of does not surprise me haha another boring game would be the highest scoring football game ever. It was 222 to 0 haha
572,Crazy! Did you know the NFL uses tracking chips in players shoulder pads?,That actually scared me. I'm sure they get a lot of great stats that they can use like the rotation of the ball. But I just hope that they keep it in the game and they don't put it on actual citizens like you or me
573,Yeah, I wonder if it is the NFL collecting it or the teams themselves to optimize plays.,But it's both honestly. What are your thoughts on the New Orleans Saints cheerleaders being forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as an NFL player?
574,I think a lot of teams actually have that. The Redskins have one too where players can't fraternize with the cheerleaders.,Oh I didn't know that. It seems very outdated but I guess they might have a reason for it. Do you know any Engineers that you're friends with?
575,yeah, I'm one and I have a bunch of friends that do it. On average we make more than a football player!,Oh that's awesome. And yep that is what I have heard did you know that the NFL has no rule against female players. Do you think we'll see one in our lifetime?
576,I've heard that before, but I don't know if Americans can stomach seeing a woman getting injured on the field.,That's a good point that I never thought about. What is also interesting to me is that an NFL game only has about 10 or 11 minutes to it that seems super low.
577,Yeah, that makes sense, it is mostly standing around if you ask me. I still love the game, but the clock watching gets annoying.,Yep I agree with that. Do you watch any fantasy movies. Or do you do fantasy football at all
578,I used to play fantasy football, but I no longer have the time for it to be honest. What about you?,I never played fantasy football but I did hear that they have fantasy National Spelling Bee and also fantasy Congress that seems so stupid haha
579,Do you like football?,I do watch some once in a while, you?
580,I have a passing knowledge. How familiar are you with the sport?,I know some of the basics, but I also know that there is really only 11 minutes of active game play.  Crazy seeing how long the games are.
581,I agree. It is also interesting how they have no rule against female players? However, I wonder if the eligibility requirements inherently disqualify them?,They might, or just make it so they wont want to play.  I mean I think anyone who is good enough should be eligible to play.  But I can imagine many women who would want to go up against 300 pound linemen
582,It is a dangerous sport and I don't think football is as developed a sport for women comparatively to most other sports,I would agree.  They even have chips in shoulderpads to record moves of players and with that they can see how hard they get hit.
583,I heard they also put chips in the footballs themselves to gather data on velocity, rotation, speed, and location,Yeah, with that do you think it could also help determine reviews?  Like use that data to say where the ball was or wasnt at any given point.
584,That I am not sure since I am not sure how much of that data is effective real time,The yellow line sure helped things develop in terms of home viewership, so much so that ESPN won an Emmy for it
585,True. It probably made things much more digestible for the general audience and promoted its popularity,Did you know that the highest scoring and biggest spread was in a game in 1916?
586,I imagine it was at least hundreds apart?,222-0.  I dont even see how that is possible.  That one team must have been really bad.
587,Perhaps a combination of the winning team being just that good and the losing team being so bad,Ive seen some blow outs, but never by that much.
588,Did you every play fantasy football?,I never have, but my brother gets seriously into it.
589,hey did you know the nfl has no rule against female players?,Smart move, no law suits that would be obvious and easy to pursue.
590,ya that iss true, do you think we'll ever see one? I think its lpossible in our lifetime,I just say something about girl who is trying to turn pro. Its seems a stretch, maybe as a kicker or punter.
591,ya I could see that, do you watch the nfl? A game actually only has about 11 mins of actual gameplay apparently,I just watch a few games here and there. Not so excited to see a bunch of millionaires play a game. How about you?
592,ya I don't watch any sports but I watched the superbowl, did you hear abou the weird rule the NFL has for Saints cheerleads?,That is such a wierd rule. I wonder what the reason is? No hanky panky?
593,lol, must be yes to prevent that sort of thing, I,Not sure an engineer makes more than an NFL player.
594,ya I think that was calculated over their lifetime, an nfl player makes a lot but only plays until age 40 or so,Its funny that they have chips in the players sholder pads.
595,ya that is crazy, I'm just hopeful they never make citizens wear those, thats too much information to share!,Do you do any fantasy football?
596,I don't actually, but I did see that people will do fantasy everything, even spelling bees!,They were actually betting on how many times they would say gronk in the super bowl. Maybe not a fanatasy league but a wierd sports related fact.
597,haha that is weird, do you do any fantasy stuff? I guess people also do fantasy politics,I don't just don't have the passion for it, you?
598,no I don't, and I just don't care about sports personally haha, have you read anything about Terry Pratchett?,I have not read about Terry Prachett, whats up with him?
599,well apparently he was knighted, he writes fantasy comedy novels, and so if he was knighted then I would assume his work must be good!,I am not sure about that some people who have been knighted are real losers in my book.
600,Hey you do any fantasy football? What do you think about Berkley,I do not normally play but he is making a comeback in the FF circles
601,Well Barclay was the second pick in the 2018 draft, so I know he's really good, do you think he's going to put up a lot of yards this year?,He did well at Penn State as a junior so hopefully he will be able to keep that up in the NFL
602,Yeah I hope so he seems very promising, also his workload should be minimal which I think will give him a lot of possibilities,I like the NFL a lot - it is curious that in the 60's bowlers made more money than NFL players!
603,Shocking! I never would have thought that, what do you think about the highest scoring football game of all time?,222-0!  I would have left after the first quarter!
604,Me too! Especially if I were rooting for Cumberland that is quite a loss LOL,Yes and back in 1916 there was not even our magical yellow line
605,Nope that might have actually helped them out haha. Maybe they would not have lost so badly, it was definitely worth giving ESPN an Emmy for creating that,I love how my school Iowa paints the visiting team's locker room pink just to screw with the other team
606,Haha that is funny. Did you go to that school? I love the Patriots, and I personally love that one of their players has never fumbled the ball, that's so good,Yes he is amazingly good.  The NFL only has 11 minutes of live gameplay so that is not that much time per game
607,Not a lot of time at all! What is shocking to me though is that females can actually play for the NFL, there is no rule against it,Yes as a kid I always wanted to play in the NFL or the MLB but being a tiny girl never quite made the team!   Luckily my career as an engineer will pay me more over the long run
608,Well that's good because you'll make more over your lifetime! What do you think about how the Saints treat cheerleaders though? My friend was a cheerleader in college and he would not have appreciated having to leave a restaurant if a player entered,Oh for sure.  That is very rude!  They would never allow a female player.  I do like what the NFL is doing with tracking chips however.
609,Yes it is interesting. They can track the speed rotation and location of the balls and also of the players, very technologically advanced,Yes did you watch the Super Bowl on the first sunday in February?  It was rather boring this year
610,hey hows it going, can you guyss who the top 3 most wealthy presidents are?,Hi! If I had to take a guess, I'd say Lincoln, Roosevelt, and Kennedy. Am I close?
611,well it would be Kennedy, washington and jefferson actually! so kind of close, they must have adjusted for inflation,I was semi close! What made them as wealthy as they did?
612,well I would imagine it was their vast property and I know washington and jefferson owned slaves, so that probably didn't hurt I suppose,I wonder if they lost their monetary value of slaves when they freed the slaves. That's kind of crazy to think about that people were like possessions that could be transacted! Now, it's just cars, homes, etc. Did you know it is illegal to warm up your car in Ohio?
613,no I didn't know that, I live in michigan and I can tell you its super cold, I wish I had a way to warm my car but I know here that is not illegal, thankfully!,Oh that's super close to Ohio, I made a trip with a friend once from Ohio to Michigan. Yeah, a remote car starter would be useful especially when you guys were affected by the polar vortex! It could be possible because Audi adjusted their car horn sound to accomodate the Indian market and its heavy usage.
614,oh wow that is interesting, we were talking about presidents did you know the president of indonesia released 3 pop albums,What? That's crazy! Maybe that's what students need in order to learn about history.
615,haha good question, I think trump should make a pop album with kanye since they seem to be friends, that woudl be crazy!,Lol! Seeing that Kanye seems pretty wild in his actions, you never know. At least he and Trump would get away with it by calling it "art"
616,haha yes maybe they could call the album "the art of my art" insteda of the art of the deal haha,Lol and you should be the producer or marketing director! I'm not sure whether or not I would change the radio station if I heard it over the radio though but Bing Crosby recordings filled more than half of the radio time in 1948.
617,wow that is crazy, he was super successful at that time, have you heard of zimbabwe? I guess they call their president President Banana,Lol! I've heard of that country but didn't know that that's what they called their president.
618,haha Vote Yellow, Vote Banana! I guess before 1805 the runner up in the presidential election became the VP, isn't that wild imagine president trump and vp hillary!,Seriously! Do you know whether or not the people of Zimbabwe vote for their president via the popular vote or they have a electoral college? 5 presidents in the US have actually been elected even though they lost the popular vote!
619,ya that's a good question I don't know, but what is crazy is that the white house is smaller than the white house's guest house!,No way! Really? Who stays in the guest house? Would family members or close relatives stay there? In Guatemala, close relatives of former presidents can't legally run for president.
620,Hi! Do you listen to the radio?,I do, I actually like to listen to radio dramas, theres a very good site with thousands of free episodes
621,I'm not familiar with what that site is, the only radio dramas I know that are free are podcasts, are those what you call radio dramas?,Yeah, that would be it, drama podcasts but in a radio show format, there is also a radio station that broadcasts news in latin!! interesting or boring?
622,Oh I see, that would definitely be boring to me since I do not understand latin, but I heard on the radio news that cars in South Africa can equip their cars with flame throwers to prevent from stealing their cars, does that mean they come with a "Launch" button?,Thats lunatic!! can you imagine cars in America with flame throwers? we would be in deep trouble for sure, I wonder why they allow that over there
623,They allow it to people from stealing each other's cars, that definitely would not fly in the US if cars would equipped with that but what does work are drive-thru's that was made popular by McDonald's to accommodate soldiers in uniforms, do you use the drive-thru's?,I do use them I think they are a great invention and I guess we owe soldiers a lot, I couldnt imagine my life without a drive-thru service, they are just life saves
624,They do more than just save lives, I get speedy service especially at the Chick Fil A, I wonder where that name came from since the Car brand Cadillac was named after a French Explorer with the same last name that also happened to found Detroit,I see, so thats were the Cadilac name comes from, you know the first car was a Benz
625,The first car was Benz? You mean the first car that was ever made, manufactured, equipped with flame-throwers, care to elaborate?,The first car ever to be made, the year was 1986 many people think it was a Ford but no,
626,Oh ok I see, I also thought the first car was a Ford but maybe its just the manufacturing process that they perfected. Crazy to see what a long way we've come to now even having professional video game sports car competitions like when Jann Mardenborogh beat 90K people in the game Gran Turismo, I don't play, do you?,I used to play it as a kid, if i knew I could have become a pro driver just from playing it I would have practiced a lot more lol
627,That would be a great accomplishment just like the president of Indonesia who released 3 pop albums while in office!,3 pop albums while in office!!  I guess he had a lot of free time, I would be worried as a citizen of Indonesia
628,Why would you be worried? I'd be worried because that seems a bit unprofessional and also wonder whether my tax dollars are being siphoned for personal use.,I would be worried because an album takes a lot of time so instead of doing his job his recording songs probably with the tax dollars of citizens, they are expensive as well.
629,Yeah exactly, I wonder if received a nickname for those pop endeavors like the president of Zimbabwe is called President Banana.,Thats funny, how can you be called Banana!!! you know that before 1905 the runner up of an election in the US would become the vice president
630,Do you like sports? I watch football every now and then but I don't really care for basketball.,yeah, I dont watch basketball at all. I used to watch football before all of the kneeling and protesting. Now my Sundays are mine again.
631,So do you agree or disagree with the kneeling? The anthem and pledge are not a requirement by law, plus it had nothing to do with the united states itself and was more in protest to police violence.,I don't agree with the protesting. Players should protest or be active on their own time.
632,I can agree with that. i think he just wanted the most publicity he could, and I hate how it is so over blown.,The NFL has given in to the PC culture and thought police in the US.
633,I feel like everything is going that way these days, everyone is so offended by every little thing now. Also I think we should all protest the NFL after that last Superbowl, it was so awful, lowest scoring Superbowl in history.,I was a huge fan. I didnt even watch the superbowl this year. Another patriots win....yawn....I mean yay
634,Yeah that is probably for the best, there was only one score, it was extremely boring, So what is your favorite tv show to watch right now.,I don't watch a lot of tv either, we can run through some of this Tv trivia though. There are over 750 episodes of pokemon. That's about 50 a year for 16 years.
635,Yeah my nephews watch Pokemon on Netflix, I found it too silly though. I did not know the UK did their own version of thats 70s show that was canceled after 10 episodes though.,yeah, that show was ok, kinda funny from what I remember. Hard to believe only 1 episode of the simpsons without bart, mentioned or appearing.
636,Yeah I still watch it on Netflix every now and then if I am bored, I have been re watching game of thrones as of late though.,ahh yeah, I did binge through the game of thrones series. Do you know when the series will be released?
637,Yep, I love it, the next season starts April 14th.I really wish it wasn't the last season but GRRM just takes too long to finish the books.,perfect! Looking forward to it returning.
638,Yeah it will be interesting to see how john and Daenerys deal with who gets the throne, since john is the actual heir.,yeah, should be good. will be interesting to see.
639,Yep, will it was nice talking to you, have a good day.,you too!
640,Do you watch football?,Hi, how are you today? Sometimes I watch football.
641,I do too. Did you know there is onlyone left handed QB in the nfl?,Yeah, I heard that. I guess it's hard for teams to adjust around a lefty.
642,I wonder if that is in fact the issue, seems like a lot of work to work around that.,I see so many lefties in the MLB, I figure it would be the same in the NFL. I am surprised by the origins of the huddle.
643,Yeah, it was to hide singals from the opposing team!,Clever. It's such a fundamental part of the game now. Do you listen to the radio much?
644,I used to, but I was wondering how you could listen to Jupiter from the AM radio.,I bet Jupiter is better than most top 40 these days.
645,Yeah, hilarious. Did you know in Canada that they make you listen to 40% Canadian music?,I think the law is there to protect Canadian artists in their home market. Everybody is a Rush fan as a result.
646,LOL, I forgot about Rush. They have a really good drummer,,He was a terrible hockey player, so he took up music.  Would you listen to a news broadcast in Latin?
647,Nah, I can't speak the language, I would get nothing out of it.,Why is this a thing in Finland? A news program in Latin? Some rich weirdo must pay for it, or there are a ton of volunteers.
648,LOL. Did you know that the president of Indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office?,I guess he had a following. I bet Trump would release albums.
649,Maybe, I'm not sure. Were the ones in Indonesia successful?,I have no idea. He probably made a law that people had to buy them. Trump would probably record with Kanye.
650,do you know who Kevin Sheehan is?,I am not sure, is he the person that launched the podcast after leaving team 980?
651,Yeah apparently his contract expired and he was not able to renew it.,Ah, do you listen to the radio a lot?
652,Not a whole lot everything's digital now a days. How about you?,I only listen to the radio while I am on the car.
653,Apparently the storms on Jupiter are so strong they can be picked on AM radio.,Wow!  There is also a website where you can listen to thousands upon thousands of classical radio dramas. All for free!
654,Free always good! Soldiers use to make radios out of razor blades and pencils in WW2 they dubbed the the foxhole radios.,Canadian radios also have to play 40% canadian music.
655,I think that's a good ideal. I think it helps to preserve their culture. What do you think about that?,I guess, although I do not think that they need that rule. A lot of artists that I listen to are already Canadian and I think that they make excellent music.
656,That's true too. did you know that the nfl has no written rule preventing women from playing in the nfl?,Really? Wow. The average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live action. I wonder why so many people still enjoy it.
657,I know it's crazy there is so much money in sports. there are 32 teams and 17 weeks of regular season with one bye week.,I agree. Thank you for your time! It was nice chatting with you.
658,Know they are going to have tracking chips in their padding as well as the football. You i enjoyed it!,The tracking chip in the football are responsible for keeping track of its rotations and velocity.
659,Yeah that makes sense. You know if a cheerleader is eating at a restaurant and a player comes in to eat they have to leave?,That is a very unfair rule, I wonder why it even exists. Do they have something against cheerleaders?
660,I assume it's got something to do with player fraternization. It's only like that in New Orleans.,Yeah. Anyways, thank you for your time! It was nice chatting with you!
661,Hello, do you like Football?,I do like Football.  Do you?  I've heard that it's been a category on Jeopardy before!
662,I do, but I don't follow it very much, and I heard about that Jeopardy show and the NFL based knowledge, I would never pass that one haha!,It could be hard.  I'm not sure I could get ones where they ask about specific plays.
663,Right? I wouldn't either. I guess during that episode Alex Trebek was considered the entertainment on that show hahaa, There were some pretty funny answers.,He is pretty good. I mean, Aaron Rodgers considers him the greatest of all time of game show hosts.
664,He is! I like him a lot. I think he knows everything about the NFL Football after being the host for so many years! Football seems so slow! An entire game only has about 11 minutes of actual live play!,Wow! That must mean a lot of commercials and penalties go on during a game!  Football has been around a long time though. The first playoff was in 1932.
665,Wow, that is a long time! But football is loved by many! I didn't know that Football players don't really make as much money as you would think, an engineer makes more in a lifetime than an NFL player!,I guess that means that Matt Patricia likes the game then more than money considering he was an aeronautical engineer before becoming a coach.
666,What? That's amazing! He must love the game a lot! Even back in the 60's pro bowlers made more than top football players! Twice as much....,That is so bizarre to think that bowlers make more than football players!  Especially with the Superbowl coming up on the first Sunday in February!
667,I know, it blows my mind! The game has been a favorite of sports fans forever. The superbowl is the best, I do watch that for sure! Those players are like animals on the field when it comes to the Superbowl!,I have to admit I do like watching the best of the nfc and afc compete against each other!  Speaking of animals, did you know there is a lawyer in Switzerland that represents them in court?
668,Represents animals? I guess since there are 20 quintillion animals out there this lawyer has his work cut out for him!,I bet he does at that!  I wonder if he would need a translator for some.  Some animals from distant areas speak different dialects or languages.
669,True, lol....I guess some animals are protected already like the loch ness monster. I guess Germany was the 1st to give animals guaranteed legal rights. That is so interesting!,That is interesting!  Have you heard about the netherlands building natural bridges for wildlife so they won't get hit by cars on the roads?
670,No! Wow, that's awesome! Very smart and kind of them. I love animals more than a lot of people lol!,It is a great thing they did! i wish the U.S. would do that!
671,I do too, we have so many animals going extinct it would probably help a lot. They deserve to thrive and be safe too.,They do indeed.  I like that they have their own scientific kingdom called Animalia.
672,Hello, how are you today?,I'm doing well, thanks!! How about you?
673,Doing great. Did you know that Iowa has painted their opponents locker room pink?,No I didn't. Do you happen to know the reason why?
674,Just guessing that pink would make the players calmer, less aggressive. I think I would retaliate by shutting of Iowas hot water.,Ha Ha!!! Thanks. Do you follow soccer at all these days?
675,No, I don't follow soccer. Do you?,Yes I do and in fact I recently read somewhere that D.C. United have a stadium called Audie Field and according to their officials it will welcome more than just MLS matches.
676,I do know that soccer is the most popular game in the world. What makes it so exciting?,It is a game that has been around for a very long time. It is played from what I heard by 250 million players in over 200 countries in the world.
677,Do you have a favorite team?,I do. I'm a big Liverpool fan but also like Juventus, Barcelona and the New England Revolution.
678,Are they all in the same league?,No the teams that I mentioned are in different leagues and in different countries.
679,With all those different leagues how do they determine who are the world champions?,Each country has a league and from there it gets determined by their position in the rankings if they making to the Champions League in Europe or not.
680,So the Champions League determines the overall champion?,Correct and that is just in Europe!!! Here in the US it works differently. I read somewhere that soccer players run on average 7 miles per game.
681,That's a lot, and I know there's a lot of real action, whereas football only has 11 minutes of live action in a game.,Wow!!! I didn't know this. I also recently read that the Super Bowl is smaller than soccer's 3rd biggest event.
682,And I didn't know that. Thanks for taking the time to enlighten me somewhat about soccer.,It was my pleasure. I love soccer and I have been watching it since I was a kid. It was great chatting with you today!!!
683,Do you follow the NFL?,Hello,  no I do not follow the NFL really.  Do you?  I recently learned that snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his sons high school team lol
684,Not really, I prefer soccer but football is an interesting game as well, interesting fact but in the 60s top bowlers made more money than football players.,That is pretty crazy considering that the football players are more prone to injuries lol I guess it was good to be a bowler back then!
685,I agree and theres also all that brain damage, I think its a risky sport but now you will earn a lot of money for doing so.,Yeah football players do make a ridiculous amount of money!
686,I agree especially players like Benjarvus Green Ellis, the guy never fumbled the ball in his entire carreer, that is an awesome stat to hold.,that is really impressive!  I wonder why that guy isnt more known lol There is a rocket scientist that was a football coach,  Matt Patricia.
687,Wow I bet he was a pretty good coach, expensive to hire as well.,Yeah.  I bet it was worth it though!
688,Yeah I agree, so do you also like soccer? its a sport that moves a lot of money,I have watched soccer on occassion,  but I do not keep up with it.  Do like soccer?
689,I do like soccer, there is a German player that donated his winning bonus to 23 Brazilian children,Wow that is amazing!
690,Yeah he has a big heart for sure, not many players would do that even dough they make a lot of money, interesting fact but soccer makes more money than almost every other sport combined,Wow that is awesome!  Good they are making good money,  seems like they get injured a lot also.
691,Yeah in soccer injuries are quite common, there are over 250 million players so imagine how  many broken legs that figure represents.,Yikes,  Id rather not thanks lol I hear soccer players run an average of 7 miles per game!
692,That is a long distance, 7 miles per game,  it must be really exhausting.,I recently learned that Greenland cant join FIFA because there's not enough grass there lol can't they use fake grass?
693,Hi, how are you this morning?,Great! Hope you're doing well! So do you follow association football aka soccer? Hard to believe it makes more money than golf, tennis, football, basketball, baseball and hockey combined!
694,I watch a little soccer.  I didn't realize it made so much money.,It's crazy, isn't it? I guess that's why Mesut Ozil donated his entire world cup victory bonus to pay for the surgery of 23 children in Brazil. Must have been pocket change considering!
695,I guess if you take into consideration it's played by 250 million people worldwide in over 200 countries, it is alot of money.  That was such a great act that Mesut did for those kids.  Kudos to him.,Agreed! Hopefully others follow in his footsteps. So do you follow regular football aka gridiron ball like the NFL? I do and always wondered why there are no females when the NFL has no rules against them joining as long as they meet the requirements!
696,I watch a little football.  I've wondered myself about the females, as well.,I mean, there's only 11 minutes of live game play anyway. So you'd think at least one or two would have been drafted or picked up by a team, right?
697,True, that's alot of standing around time on the sidelines, for sure.  You would think at least a kicker would be a female.,Agreed. Maybe they'd rather enter engineering since engineers make more than the average lifetime earnings of an NFL/MLB player. It'd be a much wiser decision, I suppose!
698,That's so true.  I find it interesting that the top bowlers in the 1960s made twice as much as the top football stars.  That's wild.,No kidding! What's even wilder (or sadder actually) is knowing Saints cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as Saints players and if one walks in after, they have to leave. That is just wrong!
699,I know.  I'd like to know the incident that prompted that rule.  I bet it's very juicy.,Exactly. I wonder what happened! Still that could classify as discrimination in this day and age, I suppose. But is that truly as bad as Georgia Tech once beating a team 222-0? Ha! The highest score ever in the game of football!
700,Yeah, I think that game was played way back in 1916, nowadays that just doesn't happen, anymore.  Look at the recent superbowl, lowest scoring superbowl game ever.,So true! But when you have players in the league like Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbling the ball, I can see why!
701,That's a pretty awesome feat for him to accomplish.  Imagine the pressure of never fumbling the ball.  It would be too much for me.,Same here. I'd probably fumble as soon as it's handed to me. Ha! Wonder what his mindset would be if he was forced to visit the visitor's lockerroom at Iowa before a game, where the massage pink? Talk about demeaning! That's crazy!
702,An all pink locker room would be very intimidating for any visiting team, for sure.  Getting back to soccer, I was shocked to learn that Jon Stewart was a skilled soccer player.,Wow! That is shocking! I tell you what surprised me was learning there is actually a soccer variation where 3 teams face each other at the exact same time! It's like, how does that happen?
703,Hello! I hope today we can have a good discussion about football and religion, and how in some cases they have merged.,I think Brady is looking for a way to stay relevant and this spirituality through football is a bit ridiculous.
704,Honestly, same. When Daniel Wann said "sports might bring people together better than religion" I honestly scoffed at how absurd that statement is.,If anything I think that the idea of sports tends to make people more divisive. It is crazy how bitter and competitive people get about teams.
705,Same, if I would agree with anyone from these articles I would agree with Bob Ryan because he's skeptical about it - as he should be!,I wonder if people would be as apt to follow brady if he was losing more than he was winning.
706,I doubt it, which is funny seeing as when it's about religion, people will follow through almost anything.,I wonder if he is setting it up to have some sort of cult or MLM stuff once he is finally too old play anymore.
707,To be honest that would be pretty cool. I enjoy learning about cults, they're interesting. I was surprised when I read the NFL has no rule against female players!,That sure is suprising considering how male dominated the sport is.
708,Honestly, yeah. Did you see about girls being allowed into Boy Scouts? Gets me pretty riled up lol. Did you see that it used to be required to read from a bible in the U.S?,I know that it was commonly used as reading curriculum. It was an easily accessible book and quite a challenging read.
709,I wish they still had classes in high school at least! Not forced, but optional.. Did you read that Iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely pink??? That cracked me up.,That does seem like something Iowa would do. They are quite into razzing other players from opposite teams.
710,Really? I don't know much about them honestly... What do you know?,There is a huge rivalry between the two teams from the main Iowa colleges. Either you are a hawkeye fan or an UN of I fan. They are as bad as packers and vikings fans
711,Ahh... It's like that down here in Alabama!! Did you see the average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live game-play?,The rest of the time must be spent on huddles and waiting for the snap. I wonder if other forms of football have more action time.
712,Yeah, that seems kinda silly to me to waste all that time..,It really does. I wonder if there was more time to the cumberland game where they set the high score record.
713,What was that all about? The cumberland game?,Cumberland completely whupped Georgia back at the beginning of the century. It was 222-0. I mean at some point you just need to give up.
714,D a n g that's crazy. Well thanks for the great conversation!,Yes it was a nice chat.
715,Good morning!  Are you a football fan?,I am a football fan, what about you?
716,I'm a fan!  Did you know that ESPN won an Emmy for creating the yellow superimposed first down line on tv?,Yeah, I heard it seems like that is pretty cool.
717,The University of Iowa's visitors locker room was painted completely pink.  Must have been to relax the players so they wouldn't have that mean edge on the field?,Yeah, you have to wonder if that actually works. I suspect it just makes the other team more angry.
718,You would think lol  It might also be for breast cancer awareness, which I think could possibly be inspiring.  Do you know what the highest score ever was for a football game?,I'm not sure, just a wild guess, but was it 222-0?
719,You got it!  What a blowout.  Former Patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis has never fumbled the football in his NFL career while with New England.,Interesting, is he the best running back ever?
720,No.  He wasn't.  Just you don't see something like that in football where a player can play for a long time and not fumble.  Even the great ones fumble a few times a year.,Yeah, that is pretty crazy. Did you know an iphone has more computing power than the entire US Nuclear ICBM deterrent.
721,Isn't that crazy?  I didn't know that.  Unicef will donate a day of clean water to a child in need for every minute you don't use your cell phone.  Sign me up. lol,Interesting. Did you know that Jupiter has radio storms that can be heard on AM radio here?
722,I think that's really cool.,I wonder what station it is actually on?
723,I don't know but I'm going to look it up.  Do you know about the Canadian radio law?,No, what does it say?
724,40 percent of the music played on there has to be Canadian artists.  Kind of neat I think.,Interesting, I wonder why nobody naturally wants to listen to that? Well, nice chatting with you.
725,Hi, do you like football?,Hello, i love the NFL now thats a real sports league!
726,Do you know if they have female players?,Well, not in the NFL they dont but i'm sure they might have a womans league
727,Did you know that the nfl has no rules against women? They could legally play if they met the requirements. What do you think?,That would be great but no woman has tried yet
728,I know right, but they only actually play 11 minutes in an actual game. That sounds a bit short!,Yeah because of the breaks, half times and timeout and calls that the refs make.
729,I wonder how much money a player makes. Do you know?,It all depends on the contract that they negociate but it is usually in the milliopns!
730,Sometimes they play concerts at halftime shows. Do you like the super bowl halftime shows?,No, i usually change the channel during the half time shows haha
731,Do you like music and concerts though?,Yeah, of course but only if i am at the live concert not watching it on tv
732,Can you believe that the Ramones have played over 2,000 concerts in 20 years?,I believe it! Especially since linkin park played 324 in 2001 alone. Add that by 20 years!
733,A Creed concert was so bad that some goers filed a lawsuit against them! That sounds funny.,That's pretty pathetic if you ask me just get your money back and go home haha
734,Yup, that is why I do not go to these events.,Well, obviously everyone else at the concert seemed to enjoy it so not to bad of a deal
735,Are there any concerts coming up that sound fun?,I haven't checked recently. Hey, i gotta go for now it was nice chatting with you. I hope you have  a great night.
736,Thank you, good night!,Good night
737,Hi do you know much about the presidents?,yes I know some stuff. Do you know who the wealthiest us presidents are?
738,Yes that would be JFK, Washington and Jefferson,Right. Did you know the guest house is larger than the white house
739,Yeah that is pretty cool, they must get a lot of people there so maybe that is why,Yeah. Have you heard the president of Indonesia is a pop star?
740,Yeah the guy has already released 3 albums, wow,Right? Do you know how the VP used to be elected?
741,Yes the runner up moved into the position of the VP, pretty nice,Yeah I think that is actually fair because they work a lot towards that as well
742,Exactly. Do you watch TV at all?,I sure do. Did you ever watch the Simpsons?
743,Yes I love that show. Did you know Bart did not appear in an episode,Yeah and the weird part is that he was not even mentioned in it
744,Yeah pretty strange. DId you ever watch that 70s show?,I did and I liked it but I guess it did not really take of in the UK as it got cancelled after 10 episodes
745,Yeah but they remade it verbatim so that I guess explains it,True, How about Pokemon?
746,I have seen some episodes but not all the 750 of them,Yeah they have been in the air for about 16 years , so long
747,Hello, do you have a favorite US president>,I am partial to rutherford b hayes. You?
748,Ah, mine is probably Lincoln for abolishing slavery.,THat's a good choice. Did you ever see Lincoln?
749,Well not in person, he died a century ago. However, I have seen him in books and on the interent.,HAHAHAHA! I meant the movie, Lincoln, with Daniel Day Lewis.
750,Haha, I was staring at that for a few seconds. Actually no,  I have not but I should go watch it now that I think about it.,It was really good. Got nominated for a bunch of awards. Of course everyone raved about DDL...
751,Ah. Did you know that Trump is now the wealthiest president of the United States?,He is? Wow, I thought it was like JFK... good to know!
752,Yeah, it was him but his wealth is tiny compared to Trump's 2.2 billion dollar networth!,Wow. That's surprising. It's also surprising knowing that there was a president called President Banana.
753,Wasn't he the very first president of Zimbabwe? That is a very odd nickname for you president!,Yes and yes! Although I could really see president carrot catching on...
754,Haha, the president of Indonesia has released a total of 3 pop albums while in office.,I feel like our president must be slacking then. They haven't released any! Slackers!
755,Haha, the guest house is actually bigger than the whitehouse itself.,The runner up used to become the VP.
756,Yeah, I am glad that they have changed that, Anyways, nice chatting with you!,Can you imagine Hillary and Trump in the same white house!
757,Haha, no I cannot! They would disagree on everything!,Yeah. It was great chatting with you!
758,China sure has become a competitive country, what are your thoughts?,I agree, I can't believe China has a 375 billion dollar trade surplus with the US. That's crazy!
759,That is so much money, China is becoming a titan and it kind of makes me afraid, one of my concerns is the trade surplus and the theft of technology.,True, it is always scary dealing with other countries, but we do get a lot from China, and they buy 130 billion dollars worth of goods from us so sounds like we can have a thing if we can keep going with it.
760,That is a good point, its mutually beneficial in the end, I think its the number 3 destination for our exports.,Definitely, and we are pretty safe because we are expanding our defense spending if they do try anything, We have several Asian allies so I think if we can all keep the peace will benefit us all.
761,I think a war would end us all though, but its good to have allies and appear strong, I think thats one of the good things Trump has done.,Yes, we really need to stay on high alert at all times and hopefully Trump did sign the bill to produce more military ships from 280 to 326...but no doubt we have to keep on top of them.
762,I agree we need to show strenght and hope we never have to use it, you know Trump is not even on the top 3 of the wealthiest presidents in US history!!,We definitely do need to stay aware. He is not? Wow, that is surprising! Isn't president Trump a billionaire? I think the wealthiest presidents had a very good side job going lol
763,He's not! his guest house is bigger than the white house so I wonder why he's not on that list, seems like the other presidents are crazy rich then.,I would think for sure Trump would be the wealthiest! Maybe Trump could make some pop albums while in office like the president in Indonesia did! haha, that would bring in more money! Then he could have concerts too! haha, pretty crazy huh?
764,Maybe he can make it to the top 3 if he sold a decent amount of albums lol, it would be crazy and it is sure fun to imagine.,Wouldn't it! I wonder if the president ever goes to any Football games or goes to concerts, or rather have them come to him lol....I love concerts and have been to many but not any lately.
765,I know the feeling, last time I went to a concert it was 2002, the band was Creed and I was totally disappointed.,Oh no! Haha, I heard there was a lawsuit against Creed at some point for the show being so bad! I went to a small venue years ago to one of Creeds concerts and it was fantastic. But he was clean and sober by that time too.
766,I see in 2002 the vocalist was viewed as a total mess, I like the band and they have good songs, so much talent wasted.,Right! But when I saw Scott Stapp he was not Creed anymore it was him doing a solo career, he was pretty high and drunk for many years but he did get better. Speaking of concerts, The Ramones played over 2,200 concerts while touring non stop for 20 years! What a crazy life!
767,I know, thats a lot of concerts, its a shame I never made it to one, do you like The Ramones?,I like the Ramones but they are not a favorite. I like a few of their songs. I like Linkin Park a lot but didn't get to see them before Chester passed away.....they played over 300 concerts in 2001 alone, I should have tried to go to one then. I loved them, still do but its not the same.
768,Did you hear about Aaron Rodgers?,Hi, do you like football?
769,Soccer or American football, i like them both.,I like them both too, I did not realize that the season lasts 17 weeks
770,it does i only know that the super bowl is in the first week of February.,They only rest one of the 17 weeks of the season.
771,Yes it's called a bye week. apparently the patriots fans have their own creed called in bill we trust.,That is impressive, also you had asked about Aaron Rodgers, he became the highest paid player
772,Yeah four year for 134 million. wow. hard to believe at one time bowlers made more than top nfl players.,He has been the most valuable NFL player twice
773,Well he deserves it he works hard and he's the same age as tom brady so he doesn't have any excuses.,He is very hopeful, he wrote a post on Instagram  were she shows he is very excited and looking forward for amazing memories!
774,The Packards were my favorite team. did you know there is no written rule which prevents women from joining the nfl?,That is so neat! I would to see that happen, but I do not think it will anytime soon
775,I think they should just make an all female league like the WNBA.,Probably a good idea, did you know there is only one left handed QB in the NFL?
776,That's all the nfl produced? Do you know who is it?,His name is Kellan Moore! Also there have only been two African American QB that have been winners in the superbowl
777,Really, wow! i know the huddle was originally invented because of a deaf quarterback.,That is a nice beginning of the huddle, who was that QB?
778,His name was paul d hubbard. do you know baker mayfield?,That is so cool. Well it was nice talking to you. Have a good one
779,Hi how are you today?,Good.  Hopefully you are doing well too.  ARe you going to watch the NFL playoffs this weekend?  The 17 week schedule is completed.
780,Yes absolutely! I love football. Do you?,Yup.  Unfortunately my favorite team, the Ravens, were eliminated.  I guess that's what happens in a single elimination tournament.
781,The nfl has no written rule against female players; women would in fact be allowed if they met the league's eligibility requirements.That would be wild.,I can't see it.  Maybe a kicker.  And they use tracking chips in pads to record the player's moves.
782,Yea they put microchips in a lot of stuff these days.,These are supposed to track the player's moves, as well as the ball's velocity and rotation.
783,All that and then  An average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay,That's crazy.  did you know that the first nfl playoff game was played in 1932.
784,Wow no I did not.,Yup, it was played on an 80 yard log dirt field.
785,The average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player and an average mlb player.And now lol,That doesn't surprise me.  Most professional athletes don't play for very long.  Matt Patricia has a nice fall back career.  He is a rocket scientist.
786,True! That's very true and very interesting.,He actually graduated  from a school whose fight song includes some trigonometry terms.
787,According to canadian law, all radios are required to have at least 40% of the music played be canadian.,That's strange for a democracy.  Did you know that there is actually a radio station that translates solar activity into sound?
788,Yes I heard about this also. Its been good talking to you.,You as well.  I hope you have a nice evening.
789,did you know that a deaf quarterback came up with the huddle? I guess it would block the other team from seeing his hand signals,That's an interesting fact. Do you enjoy football and the nfl?
790,Football is ok, I don't really like the NFL but I tolerate it, what I think is crazy is there is only 1 left-handed quarterback that plays in the NFL right now, I wonder if that gives him an advantage,Well the NFL has done a decent job as it is now recognized as among the 4 major sport leagues in North America.
791,yes that is true, they definitely are successful, I guess I don't get why so many people watch NFL games when there is, on average, only 11 mins of actual football gameplay in a whole game,It may because they put a lot of dedication into their profession. Did you know that nfl implant chips into player's shoulderpads to record their everymove to use their data for better plays and understanding of football? They even put them in the footballs themselves
792,that is interesting but also kind of creepy, I guess it's good for getting all kinds of interesting stats, hopefully they don't apply them to real life and start tracking normal people with that stuff,It is interesting how they are trying to track velocity, rotation, ball speed and location. I wonder how well they have implemented this new data. Regarding your opinion on tracking normal people, I agree.
793,ya, and I don't like that New Orleans cheerleaders aren't allowed to eat in the same restaurant as players, like I don't get why they can't do that, maybe in case of sexual harrasment? But that seems really stupid,I think that is more a new orlean saints problem than an nfl problem. In fact, the nfl has no written rule against female players
794,that is wild, do you think we'll see a female player in our lifetime? what is crazy is that the average engineer makes more in their lifetime than the average NFL player, you'd think that'd be reversed,Well I think that is because an average NFL player is active for far less than than an average engineer
795,that's true, what age do NFL players usually retire? I know they get problems with their joints and also brains potentially from all the impacts,I'm not sure, but those 11 minutes of gameplay sure take their toll, especially since they result in severe injuries
796,yes, it doesn't seem like a lot of time per game, now I know why I get bored watching football! there is literally not much action happening, it always seems to drag out forever espeically when a game gets near the end and they start using timeouts,Speaking of football, are you familiar with Alex Smith of the Redskins?
797,I have not heard of him no, I can't say I know a lot about football unfortunately,He is a rookie for the red skins that some feel will lead the new ear of running backs coming around the nfl league
798,ah interesting, well they should make sure to put the tracking chips on him so that they can study his moves and see how they can improve everyone else!,I agree he seems to be good all around with no real weakness in his game. From pass game to running the ball, even in protections, he is well versed.
799,Do you follow the NFL?,not really. I only watch the Superbowl every year.
800,So you watch the Superbowl at the beginning of this month?,Yes. It was a lot of fun. I was with a big group at my workplace. Someone in the group won a lot of money & he was really happy. I had no idea that they put chips in the players shoulder pads. That is very interesting.
801,It is interesting I agree, specially because of all the cool stats taken out of them, the football alos has a chip. Technology is really cool,I am wondering what the AM radio station is to hear the sounds from Jupiter now!
802,I didnt know that was possible it must be amazing to tune in the radio and listen to the radio storms,It's very interesting. I think I had heard of "foxhole radios, but I had no idea that they were made out of razorblades & pencils.
803,I bet that chaged lifes back in war, did you hear about that latin news broadcast sation? its been around since 1989,That is really interesting. I guess that would be the only way to pick up latin or try to listen to it! I really like listening to other radio stations or music/DJ's from around the world.
804,I head Pandora radio is a great service that can help you with that, do you subscribe?,No. I have simple radio. They have an app & you can also listen online.
805,Oh I see, so you dont have the app,,I don't have the pandora app. There are so many music apps to listen to or have now.
806,I guess they are greay I have Spotify and theres like a radio segment in it as well.,Yeah. It's really interesting that the circular huddle was created by a deaf quarterback. I'm not a big enough person to have ever played football.
807,Me neither, it always seemed like a dangerous game for me, its a good thing QB have protection from the defensive line,Yeah. Also, concussions are a real thing. Maybe there should be some sort of chips in the players helmets as well.
808,They should that way we can really tell the impact of hits and the consequences on the long run,I'm surprised there aren't already. You'd think that that would also be as important (if not more important) than tracking the players movements through their shoulder pads!
809,Do you like Football?,I am a big fan of the NFL - every fall watching the league get whittled from 32 teams to one ultimate winner - its great fun!
810,Yes it is!  You see Alex smith took so many AP tests that he entered college as a junior?,Yes and was working on a masters when he got drafted!
811,That's awesome.... love when these high paid proffessionals take their education seriously!,yes but in reality an engineer will make more in his lifetime than a nfl player
812,Yeah... but if they control their finances correctly they can make soooo much more!,That is true.  All for only 11 minutes of gameplay a week
813,LOL... yeah!  Now that is crazy that us as fans sit their for like 3 hours for that little bit of action?,Exactly.   Now if we could get female players into the game - that would make it more interesting
814,Yes definitely!  I could definitely see a female kicker in the league!,For sure.  But probably not for the Saints - they seem to be pretty anti-women
815,I saw that... i don't understand in todays day how they get away with that?,Yes cheerleaders should be able to continue eating in a restaurant when players come in
816,I agree.. or just make it whoever is their first does not have to leave!,That would make more sense!  I bet they want the tracking chips they use in the game used all the time
817,I am sure they do!  I wonder when other sports will start using those tracking chips?,Yes it does seem really helpful - I could see it working well in soccer
818,DEfinitely! Crazy Kellan Moore is the only left handed quarterback,That is strange considering how many lefty pitchers there are in baseball
819,Football fan?,Oh yes, I love Ronaldo and Messi ! Can't seem to have enough of them ! ;)
820,Ah, how about American football? DId you see the Bengals' loss Sunday?,Naah, I didn't - who were You cheering for ?
821,The Bengals. Dalton had a thumb injury that ended his season. Can you believe a thumb is that important? I caught it on the radio so I didn't really see it.,Yeah - thumbs were very important in our evolution :) lol, hey how can one (quarterback ) make the touchdown pass to himself ? I mean... how ?
822,Maybe it's time for a woman to step in and take over as QB? The NFL has no official prohibition against women quarterbacks.,Do You think it's a good idea ? Are they physically ready ?
823,There's the rub. There's only 11 minutes of live gameplay so it's not like they're benching 500lbs for 2 hours straight.,I guess You're not looking for an actual conversation here, just copying the subjects from the article... are You not afraid they will reject our work ?
824,Article? I was discussing football. Guess the Bengals will have to start Driskel.,I asked You if You think women are ready for that game ? like physically ? I guess You've missed that question...
825,Possibly, They should probably protect their thumbs though. You never know what could get injured.,With all the money invested in that game, do You think they would risk to out women into the field ? I mean can they be as strong or fast ?
826,Some might. ALl you have to do is meet the eligibility requirements. If a woman could meet those then why not?,Like I said - I wonder what the investors would say if they would see woman in a team they invested millions of dollars...
827,It's enough of a novelty that it might work. ALl the money's at the top. An engineer earns more in his/her lifetime that the average NFL player.,Engineer ? Really ? I saw some numbers how much NFL players earn... little hard for me to believe in that...
828,Not everyone in the NFL earns the giant paydays and not all play for that long. If you're Colin Kapernick you may get kicked out earlier than you want for your activism and lose money there too.,I guess You're right... Mr. Kapernick  better start training to be an Engineer ;)
829,What do you think of Eli Manning?,He seems like a nice guy. He's had a long and pretty good career until recently.
830,It seems his most likely replacement, Kyle Lauletta, got into some serious trouble, almost running over a cop and other things.,Oh wow! I did not hear about that. Has he been charged?
831,Yes, the Giants have seen better days.  They were 1-7 when it happened.,Yeah they certainly fell off in their performance in the last few years. Do you enjoy football?
832,Yes.  It looks like the Giants have another alternative in 31 year old Alex Tanney but he has limited experience.,I have not heard of him. Hopefully he can bring the team back to where they used to be.
833,It's nice that after Lauletta's arrest, RB Barkley stick up for him as a good man.,Hopefully it was just one mistake and not representative of his character. Speaking of QB's, are you familiar with Alex Smith?
834,Yeah, he's the smart guy that took so many AP tests that he started college as a junior.,Yes he did. He was actually working on his master's when he was drafted. That's very impressive.
835,Yes.  I think it's odd that Kellan Moore is then only left-handed QB in the NFL.  You see so many left-handed pitchers in MLB.,Oh wow! You would think there would be more but when I think about it I don't remember seeing a QB throw with his left hand.
836,Me either... The circular huddle is common though.  It started because of a deaf QB so the other team couldn't read his hand signals.,I would think it would be very difficult to be a deaf QB. You couldn't hear play changes or calls in your helmet and you'd think you'd get sacked more.
837,Yes, that must have been a long time ago.  Did you know WW I soldiers made  radios out of razor blades and pencils?,I did not. I had no idea you could make a radio with so little.
838,All I know is that I would probably just end up cutting myself.  Back to football, it's interesting that the NFL has not rules against women playing.  Go for it ladies!,I agree. I see no reason even with the size difference why they could not play.
839,DO you like NFL?,Yes I do. DId you hear they are placing chips on the players now?
840,What for? I imagine that is when they are playing,Yes during the games to track velocity and rotation and such
841,Nice I wonder if they can use that to make the game safer,Me too. Did you know Matt Patricia is an astronaut turned coach?
842,Wow that is such a huge career jump for someone,Yeah it is. do you know when the first NFL game was played?
843,Not sure of that but I know it only has 11 minutes of gameplay,Wow that is it? The first game was played in 1932
844,Cool it has been around for a while. DO you like BRady?,I like him yes. Did you know Kellan Moore is the only left handed QB
845,Cool. Brady was a backup QB in high school and was never started,wow they wasted a good chance to win some games there
846,Yeah. Do you know Alex Smith completed college in two years?,Wow that is super fast, how did he manage that?
847,smart kid, took lots of ap tests in high school,wow amazing. Brad Johnson is the only QB that threw himself a touchdown pass
848,I did not even know such a thing is possible at all,I know right? Do you listen to the radio much?
849,hi do you watch the NFL?,I sure do , did you know women can play too?
850,Yes as there is no rule that does not allow them if they qualify,Yes. Did you know there is only 11 minutes of game play in a game?
851,Yes crazy since it takes forever for the game to end with everything else in between,Yeah I know. Engineers make more money than NFL players over the lifetime
852,Yes but I guess they have longer careers too so maybe that is why,Yeah that is actually a good point, it makes much more sense
853,did you hear about that rule for New Orleans cheerleaders?,Yes them not being able to eat in the same restaurant as the players
854,what is up with that rule, and worst, they have to leave mid meal too,Yes it is sexist and it really needs to go
855,Yes I agree. Did you know they are using chips on the players now?,Yes they are tracking velocity and speed and all that stuff
856,I wonder if there is a way to use that data to make the game safer,I hope so too. Do you like rap music?
857,Somewhat. I like the old stuff from like Tupac and Eminem,Yes me too. Tupac's music is in the library of congress for cultural significance
858,Yes. Did you know Eminem wanted to be a comic book artist?,Yes he seems to really like spiderman of all the superheroes
859,Hi!  Do you follow football?,Sorry, I can't say that I do,I'm familiar with the big stories , but that is it.
860,That is about how much I know, just the basics, and some fun trivia.,I used to live in DC son kind of know the Redskins, but Alex Smith is new to me, is he the quarterback?
861,Yes.  He took so many AP classes in high school he entered college as a junior, he started working on a masters then.,Now that is impressive, you have this impression of sports players as jocks, but he transcends that stereotype.
862,He really does, he was drafted as a number one pick in 2005 too.,Do you go to football games?  I've been to one once in my life at Indiana University.
863,Ive been to quite a few at Florida State, but no pro games.  There is only 11 minutes of live action anyway,I think that is what puts me off, I really don't have time to sit in front of the TV for three hours, and then for only 11 minutes of play.
864,It is hard to find time for that, I dont know how some people do it all day, on a weekly basis.,I guess some people listen to games on the radio, difficult to see how that works.
865,Ive done it traveling, youve got to really know the team and all of the players names.  It was so much harder.,Do you have a favorite NFL team.  Like I said, I lived in DC for a while so kind of follow them.  Now in northern Ohio, the Browns are a difficult team to support.
866,I feel you there, living in Florida here.  Dolphins are hard to root for and feel proud.,It could be worse, I read about this team that lost 220-0.  It would be hard to watch to the end.
867,That would be really hard.  GA tech sure did dominate that game.,They probably have some plaque in the locker room to commemorate it.  I  hear one team paints the opponents locker room pink, seems a little childish to me.
868,It does, plus it is that kind of toxic behavior that makes simple things like colors bad.,The money these pro players get now is huge,  funny to think pro bowlers made more than footballers back in the sixties.
869,Thats wild.  I wonder what the pay was back then?,Probably not much for either of them.
870,Yeah, nothing like it is today.  Way too much imo,Nice chatting with you, have a good evening.
871,Hello, Lets talk about Football. There is a locker room at the university of Iowa painted Pink,That is weird. Do you happen to know why that is?
872,That locker room is used for visiting teams, maybe it was done to play with their mind before a game.,Ha! That could be it. They probably did to throw the visiting team off their game. That makes perfect sense.
873,Back in the 1960's football stars used to make less money then bowlers.,Wow!! I didn't know this but I bet that is not the case these days, football players make way more than bowlers now, right?
874,I would think so. The creation of the yellow first down line won ESPN and emmy,That is very nice. I think this Emmy was well deserved because people could see where the actual first down was because before it was a guessing game.
875,Georgia tech hold the record for highest scoring game in 1916, they won with a score of 222,Wow!!! Who did they beat up that badly, do you know?
876,Yes they were up against Cumberland who ended the game with a score of 0,That is too bad for them, I guess Cumberland just made an appearance to the field that particular day. Ha Ha!!!
877,Lets talk about Radio next. There are radio storms so strong on Jupiter that then can be heard on am radio.,That is a very interesting. Thanks. Did you know that radio systems need an antenna to convert electric currents into radio waves?
878,i did not , if you want to listen to old classic radio dramas, there is a website dedicated to that.,Thanks. Do you happen to know the name of the website that does this?
879,I do not. Back in WW2 soldiers made radios out of razor blades and a pencil.,Wow!!! I guess they were very creative in making radios to communicate with each other.
880,In Canada they have a law that all radios must play at least 40% Canadian music.,I didn't know this. Thanks. Did you know that a radio receiver receives its input from an antenna and then it converts it into a form that is usable for the consumer?
881,Hello, are you a football fan.  Did you know that the visitors locker room is Pink at the University of Iowa.,Well I love pro ball, not so interested in college, it's too emotional from players.
882,In the 1960's, the top bowlers earned twice as much as the top football stars.,I believe that. Football was just beginning to become popular. If the two leagues hadn't consolidated it might have remained at that level.
883,Really, that is cool.  Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222.0 in the highest scoring game ever.,Must have not had a defensive coordinator back then. You have a favorite team?
884,I like the Carolina Panthers (i'm a NC man).  Tom Brady was either bad in HS or his coach didn't notice him.  He was a backup Quarterback and even though his team was having a historically bad season, he couldn't get a start.,I have had several different teams through the years. I was an avid Raiders fan until they moved to LA, now I root for the Seahawks since I'm from Wa.
885,Seahawks are cool. I am a Russell Wilson fan.  He went to NC STATE the first 3 years.  I went there.  Did you know that there is only 1 left handed Quarterback in the NFL.  It is Kellan Moore.,I wonder if being left-handed is an asset or a hinderance. I think that Kenny Stabler was also a leftie but that was long ago.
886,I think I remember him.  A cool fact is that the circular huddle used today is because of Paul D. Hubbard.  He was a deaf Quarterback and they started huddling that way so the defense could not see his hand signals.,I had heard that. I wonder how he handled the snaps? Maybe just touched the center. How about Alex Smith, not only a great QB but also very smart.
887,Yes he was.  I think he took enough AP tests in high school to enter college as a Junior.,Amazing man. Did you play FB in school? I was raised in Fairbanks Ak and the snow didn't totally disappear until @ May 1st, school let out mid May so it would have been a very short season.
888,No, I played basketball.  Going back to Alex Smith, he also began working on his master's degree before he became the first pick in the 2005 NFL draft.,Hope he finishes it. While it might not pay as much, education is the best thing you can have.
889,Yes, that is true.  The Quarterback for the University of Oklahoma, Baker Mayfield, considered quitting football to become a full-time competitive gamer.,One of my sons wanted to be a game coder but he ended up being an IT specialist. You have a pick for the super bowl yet?
890,He claims he can beat anyone at the University of Oklahoma one on one in Halo 3.  I never played games like that.,Neither have I. If a game requires quick reflexes I'm lost. I do alright in strategy games where I can take my time to think before I do anything.
891,Good morning!  Are you planning to watch the NFL playoffs today?,Definitely yes.  I am a huge Eagles fan, Go Birds!
892,Which quarterback do you like better for the Eagles?  Wentz or Foles?,I like Wentz but Foles has the magic right now
893,He definitely does.  Hopefully the officials let the players play today.  I am all for protecting QBs like Foles, but some of the roughing the passer calls have been awful.,Yes I agree especially for Clay Matthews
894,That's a good point and Redskins CB, Josh Norman, has been very outspoken about this issue.,I live in DC and Josh Norman is disliked, it's a common opinion that all he does is talk and not play well
895,Lol.  Well you might be a little biased, you can't support both the Redskins and Eagles can you?,I only support the Eagles, just the Redskins are the local team so we get a ton of news about them daily.  Its kind of like a circus LOL
896,I bet!  I am in Nebraska where college football is king.  Though I was thinking about Iowa where visiting locker rooms are painted pink!,LOL yes I have heard about that.  Do you follow an NFL team?
897,I usually root for a good game, but I think I am usually more against certain teams/coaches rather than for one.,Do you listen to alot of radio?
898,I listen to some, especially talk radio.  I like having my choice I guess.  In Canada, for example, they require almost half of the music on the radio be Canadian.,Yes I read that, kind of interesting
899,I am probably more interested in all the innovation like World War II soldiers were able to construct a working radio with just a pencil and switchblade.,Yes that is amazing, was also shocked when I read that
900,I guess I find all of it fascinating.  How did someone figure out that these waves could be converted into sound?,I know its crazy, I wonder if it was one of those I have an idea moments
901,Hey there do you watch the NFL? It stands for the National Football League btw,I do, I follow it pretty closely, what about you?
902,I follow it sometimes, I did watch the Super Bowl which I found a little bit boring, but I do like the Patriots I'm glad they won, what about you?,Not a patriots fan, but yeah, the superbowl was super boring this year.
903,Yes I agree. I wonder if it's because then average NFL game only has 11 minutes of gameplay to it. The rest is commercials, and referees and such,Yeah, that could be a big part of it. They do always seem to be standing around.
904,Yep that's true. Would you watch the NFL if it had female players? Apparently there's no rule against it,I don't know if people want to see female players.
905,Yeah I don't know! They would have to be very athletic too. Oh, what I don't like is how the New Orleans Saints treat their cheerleaders though, did you hear about that?,yeah, a lot of teams actually have that rule. The redskins do too, I know because I have a few friends who cheered for them a few years back.
906,Oh interesting, how did they like being cheerleaders by the way, and that's interesting that the Redskins have that rule too, I wonder if all the teams do,They don't get paid well and it is a lot of work. The rule is actually no fraternizing, but Chris Cooley (a player) at the time ended up marrying one and it created a big stink for the other cheerleaders. LOL
907,LOL that's funny. I can see I guess why they have that rule though. What do you think about pink locker rooms by the way? Apparently the University of Iowa did that to the opposing team's locker room,I think it is hilarious that they do that to guest teams, but I'm not so sure it bothers the other teams.
908,I know right. I wonder if they check their win-loss record before and after they did that, in terms of how different it would be LOL or if it made no difference at all. I do think it's funny to that Bowlers used to make more than football players back in the 60s,I wonder how popular bowling was way back in the day.
909,Yes I wonder, especially because shows like The Flintstones would use it, maybe it was super popular? Also, they didn't have things like the superimposed yellow line, I know that the ESPN came out with that and won an Emmy, I don't think that was back in the 60s though,They deserve the emmy for that. It is pretty cool. I wonder if any football players became bowlers in the 60s?
910,That's a good question, I wonder how many good football players we lost to Bowlers because they would be paid more LOL, what do you think about dogs by the way? Do you have one?,I heard that dogs and elephants are the only animals that instinctively understand pointing.
911,Hi there! So I was reading about Pokemon and I guess there are over 750 episodes. That's about 50 a year, for 16 years straight!,are you a pokemon fan? i have never seen the show. i figure its for kids. is it?
912,I'm not so much  fan, I was actually reading about televisions, since I just recently broke mine. But my youngest brother used to love that show, so I would do the Pikachu voice for him. (The little yellow character, that I think is most popular).,isnt that show japanese or something?
913,Speaking of foreign TV, I heard that 70's show was remade verbatim in the UK, and called "Days Like These" and was cancelled after 10 episodes. I wonder why? Did they not have the same kind of 70's as we had here?,why would they do something so stupid as that? verbatim? like that would fool anyone.
914,I'm not sure what they where trying to do there. So I just found out that New York's area code is 212 because it was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone. I didn't even know New York's area code and now I learned a fun fact! :),have you ever used a rotary phone? very slow. the new yorkers got lucky.
915,Yes I have used a rotary phone! Makes me feel so old, haha. But good times, for sure. Oh wow, this is more of a weird fact, than a fun fact but apparently it's impossible to separate 2 phone books that simply have their pages overlapped together! What not that I have a phone book but I'd like to test that to make sure!,it is a useless fact except maybe for a bar bet. i guess you could win a drink. i used a rotary phone too.
916,I have a sort of useful fact about phones! The cables carrying phone and internet data across oceans are only 2.7 inches in diameter and just lay on the ocean floor! That doesn't sound very reliable, but seems to be working.,i think that it is probably pretty sturdy. plus it is way down on the bottom of the sea. nothing lives there except maybe tiny creatures.
917,Hm, another probably not-so-interesting fact, an iPhone has more computing power than the entire US nuclear ICBM deterrent. Do you have an iPhone?,no i dont. coincidentally i do have an ICBM deterrent.
918,Haha! I don't have an iPhone either. Too expensive for my taste (or wallet)!,too expensive. the icbm deterrent has text messaging, which is good enough for me.
919,Apparently, Unicef will donate a day of clean water to a child in need for every minute you don't use your cell phone. Hm, I wonder what their aim is there. And I wonder why they don't just donate every child in need, clean drinking water. Or simply what is gong on there?!,raising awareness i guess. its not just the problem and the solution but getting people to think about others around the planet. and how much time they spend on those phones.
920,Yeah, i see your point. I usually keep my phone turned off, which renders it pretty useless most of the time. But it feels good to me! Plus I'm sick of all those spam calls or whatever the kids are calling them.,yeah,i guess those all the time. irritating. anyway, great chat!
921,do you watch the NFL?,I do. DId you know women can play too?
922,Yes there is no rule against them as long as they qualify,Yeah. THe game only lasts for 11 minutes, active game at least
923,Yes. DId you know engineers make more money over their lifetime though?,Yes but they also have longer careers than the football players
924,True, good point. Did you hear about that rule for New Orleans cheerleaders?,Yes they cannot eat in the same place as the players
925,Yes and they also have to leave mid meal if they walk in,Yes it is absurd and sexist and it needs to go
926,I agree. THey are using tracking chips on the players now,Yes they are collecting stuff like velocity and rotation and such
927,Yeah. DO you know much about the presidents?,Some stuff. DO you know who the three wealthiest ones in the US are?
928,Yes it is Jefferson, Washington and JFK,Yeah. Do you know what the first president of Zimbabwe was called?
929,Yes he was called President Banana,Yes. Did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house?
930,Cool. Do you know how the VP used to be elected?,Yes the runner up. DO you use facebook?
931,Yes. Did you know they offered myspace to but it and they turned it down,Yesh for $75 million they could have made billions now
932,Hello,  do you watch football?  I read there is a running back who used to play for the patriots then never fumbled!  That is crazy!  This guy should be more popular,  I never heard of him,  Benjarvus Green- Ellis.,Watching the Eagles now!  Hope they win:)  If they win with a score of 223 or higher, they'll beat the record for the highest scoring football game over the old record of Georgia Tech in 1916
933,I saw that somewhere,  amazing!  Good job Georgia Tech!  I can;t believe bowlers use to make twice as much as football players in the sixties!  Thats insane,  bowling must have been super popular at that time!,That is crazy.  Do you ever see the yellow line?  ESPN Created it
934,Yeah and won an award for it.,Do you like baseball?  A married couple scheduled all the games up until 2005.  In fact they scheduled 2430 games.
935,That is a lot of time dedicated to baseball lol I hope they got paid!  It is nice when couples have a hobby that they are so passionate about though.,Sure is!  If you like to watch football as a couple, then you really only need 11 minutes to watch live gameplay.  But, you probably spend a few hours.
936,lol but you have to spend like 3 hours to watch that 11 minutes of gameplay though....,Yep that's exactly what I said.  Did you hear about the man who found lots of 1900's baseball cards in his grandfathers attic?  They were hidden since 1940's.  Do you know how much they were worth?
937,Not really,  you said you only need 11 min to watch the gameplay.  That was confusing.  Yeah I read about that,  I think it was 3 billion.  or around there.,$3 million in fact.  That's a lot of cash!  If you are a cheerleader for the New Orleans Saints, you have to leave a restaurant if an NFL player comes in after you.  That stinks.
938,That seems really rude.  But I get it,  they aren't suppose to interact with football players.  I think they have a crappy job though,  they have to pay for their own travel expenses and now they have to leave a restaurant if a football player comes in,  what if they are not done eating.  sad.,They should get reimbursed by the NFL for the meal then or have the NFL player pay for it.
939,They should!  But who knows.  i just learned that women can play in the nfl!  I didn't know that before1,There is no rule against it.  I never thought they couldn't.  I just didn't think anyone made it that far that was female.  Probably there have been more than a share of obstacles to get there.  Nice thing is that if you are an engineer, chances are you will make more average lifetime earnings than that of the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player or mlb player
940,That's great for the engineer!  Seems a little weird though because football players risk they health and safety all the time.,It is a very dangerous sport.  Did you hear Tim Tebow switched from the NFL to MLB but didn't fare so well getting moved to the Mets' minor leagues
941,No I actually didn't hear that,  but I do not keep up with football much.  He probably thought that since he was already a pro athlete he would be pro in mlb as well,  but everyone has to start from the bottom.,Tebow had been a Heisman Trophy Winner in the NFL, so he did have a lot of prior success in the majors.
942,What do you think about the controversy about the name of the Redskins ?,The issue has been around several decades.
943,Don't the polls show that that the natives are not offended but the name.,Native Americans do not take that in negative.
944,But at the same time, the Cleveland Indians have changed their mascot because it was offending.,Cleveland decision should finally compel the washington football team to make honorable decision.
945,You are right, besides that what do you think of football ? I think it is too slow,  there is only 11 minutes of gameplay in a match.,Its need very hardwork and pratice.  Make the nation pride.
946,What do you think of women playing in the NFL ? there is no rule against it.,They are have equal oppourtunity. We are living in the 21st century.
947,yet if there is a Saints player enters a restaurant, any cheerleaders already present have to leave it.,Yes, to prevent fraternization.  It's better to avoid cheerleaders.
948,But should the player just leave the restaurant, that puts the player (male) above the cheerleader (female) ?,Cheerleaders seem to distract players. It's best to avoid it
949,Don't you see this as a little sexist a rule that only the cheerleaders have to abide for ?,I think it's best not to have players distracted.
950,I have difficulties understand your point. But football was not as popular as today in the 60s, then bowlers made 2x as much as footballers.,Sorry, in the twentieth century, there were several various kinds of football which grew to most popular team.
951,OH that is interesting, like soccer-baseball in Canada which is kickball in the US.,Yes, Baseball is so popular in Japan also many fans are surprised to discover its status as America's national pastime.
952,Hi, how are you?,Good.  Thanks for asking.  Did you watch the Superbowl this past weekend?  It was on the first Sunday in February  right on schedule.
953,I did watch it. Did you?,Yup, but wasn't very impressed with the game or the commercials.  The spectacle was good though.  The NFL has come a long way since playing it's first game in 1932 on an 80 yard long dirt field.
954,yes it has. In fact they went over $1B in sponsorship for the first time ever! They're huge!,They sure stepped away from Papa Johns though.  Between him using the n word and saying that protesting NFL players were hurting his business, they had enough of him.
955,Yeah. He's not in their commercials anymore... Not smart!,I know.  He founded that company 30 years ago, and just like that he's out.  Way to really screw things up...
956,If he says that on a conference call, imagine what he would say in private. It puts the University of Louisville in a tough spot because he paid a ton for his name to be on those buildings.,They'll probably ride it out.  What he said was horrible and inappropriate.
957,I guess I am questioning his decision making as he was on a conference call trying to make him a better speaker and he's being racist...,Agreed.  Can't dispute that at all.  I believe he is still owns a substantial portion of the company and will stand to profit when the company and its stock price rebound.  I wonder if he bought more stock when the price crashed.
958,Possibly. It shocks me that these CEOs can be that brilliant to start these huge companies but not be a decent human.,I supposed greed get in the way.  They start out with noble intentions, and inevitably blow it.  And the bigger the company gets, the more lives they impact when their franchise owners and workers have to feel the repercussions as well.  They are left to look at his face that was still on all of their pizza boxes.
959,Well, do you like football? I thought his comments about it were short sighted and probably driven by Jerry Jones.,I do enjoy football.  My favorite team is the Ravens.
960,Nice. Im a chicago guy. You all had a nice season and found your QB...,Assuming he can get his timing down, arm strength is fine.  You guys have a pretty nice QB yourselves.  I'd take him in a heartbeat.  I wonder what those tracking chips embedded in the player's shoulder pads show when he takes off and runs.
961,I am worried about him long term if he keeps running. He will get clobbered and out for a while, like RG3.,Yup, same with Lamar Jackson.  Of course, we have RG3 too, so there's that...  Now all we need is one of those $50,000 1,100 pound American Flags to unfurl before every home game.
962,hi how are you? do you like sports?,I'm doing well thanks I love sports! I like football a lot. American football that is.
963,i like american football. i dont have much chance to watch. i try to watch the super bowl.,Yeah I love watching the Super Bowl. As is tradition it was held in the first Sunday in February.
964,yeah, it is a great tradition. i did not watch this years sb, but last years was great.,Yeah you didn't miss much this year. I wish an AFC team didn't win this year. I don't like the patriots.
965,i am tired of the patriots always winning. it gets old. i usually root for the underdog.,Yes me as well. The first NFL playoff game was played in 1932 on an 80 yard long dirt field inside Chicago stadium.
966,that is funny. i didnt know that the NFL was so old. only 80 yards? well, i guess it couldnt be helped.,Yes true. There was actually a rocket scientist who coached in the NFL before. Matt Patricia!
967,that is great! i wonder what drew him to football. rocket science is a bit different! LOL,Yes very true. I also like baseball too. And a typical major league baseball season a total of 160,000 baseballs are used.
968,that is amazing. each team plays 162 games. i wonder how many balls per game get used.,Yeah that is a lot of games. The Chicago cubs were the first baseball team to win back to back World Series. Pretty cool!
969,that is cool! then they had a dry streak for about...how long? is it a curse?,Not sure if it is a curse but it definitely could be. A rule that I have never heard of is that if a player catches a baseball in their hat the opposing team receives three bases.
970,is that true? when did someone ever catch a ball in their hat? i might have to look that rule up.,Yes I need to look it up to. The minor-league baseball team in Albuquerque was named after the baseball team in the Simpsons LOL.
971,that is great! life imitates art. i wonder if they are any good. they have to live down to their namesake. LOL,Ha ha yeah definitely. Well high school football is definitely more popular than high school baseball because there's a $60 million high school football stadium in Texas.
972,those stadiums are basically giant temples. people go there to worship. LOL i like sports, but i think that more money should go to education. Anyway, great chat,Great chatting with you too I hope you have a pleasant afternoon.
973,Raiders havent won a Superbowl in a long time if at all?,I'm not really that into football. Maybe it's because there are only about 11 minutes of live gameplay per game.
974,Yeah 11 minutes seems like a scam, games lasts for about 3 hours and only 11 minutes of gameplay, totally unfair,Haha. I wonder if anything will change for the Raiders when they move to Vegas. I'm kind of sad to see them go since I'm from that area,though I cannot say I'm a fan.
975,Many fans must be sad, they will gain new fans on the plus side and maybe their drough will be over, changing cities can be a good thing, the stadium must be really nice,It seems like it's still unclear as to where the Raiders will play in 2019
976,It seems like a college stadium is a likely fit for the team, its a complicated issue, lets hope the stadium is ready quickly,Yeah, it really is a complicated matter. The city is expected to file an antitrust lawsuit over the Raiders' move to Las Vegas.
977,It seems like a long fight, that will take a lot of time to settle, the lawsuit has to materialize yet so maybe they wont find enough to keep it,The Chronicle thinks it will happen. However, the Raiders probably do not hold a great hand.
978,Yeah it seems like they broke an agreement, they should have thought twice before changing cities.,Yeah there are a bunch of reasons why it can't be in the Bay Area or Las Vegas so we shall see.
979,Yeah, so you said youre not really into fooball but do you have a favorite team?,I just like teams from the bay area, haha. That would be the Raiders and 49ers. How about you?
980,I see lol, well mine is in the AFC, and just won the Superbowl,can you guess what team im talking about?,The Patriots, yes they are an awesome team! It's interesting how much technology there is in football today. There are tracking chips in shoulder pads and footballs.
981,Yeah the Patriots, thats my favorite team and it is interesting! technology has advanced so much that chips can tell us all kinds of cool stats about the game,Yeah. Espn's yellow line helps me out a bit. They even won an Emmy for that.
982,Do you think ESPN deserved an emmy for that?,Haha, not sure. It's interesting how much Americans love football now. In the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars.
983,They did? I dont see them making more money now a days, football players are loaded, they earn a lot of money,Yes. Surprisingly though, the average engineer makes more over a lifetime and the average NFL player.
984,Do you like to go to concerts?,Yes. One of my favorite bands played 2263 concerts. The Ramones toured almost non stop for 20 years.
985,The Ramones are a great band, one of my favorites as well and 2263 concerts! wow that is insane!,I know! Well it seems like Linkin Park was on their way to catching up to that number. They played 324 concerts in 2001 alone.
986,That is also insane, thats like 1 concert per day, I wonder how they did that,I know. I didn't realize they were that popular. Unlike the band Creed who played a concert so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit.
987,I heard that concert was terrible imagine getting sued lol,,That must have been really bad. Pink Floyd would not have had the same problem. First, they are a great band and secondly they played an Ancient Roman Amphitheater with no audience.
988,I wonder what where his reasons behind that, sounds like a great venue for a full concert, lots of money,I think they recorded it and then shared the recording with fans but no one was there to witness them live.
989,Still a great venue like that ancient Roman amphitheater in Croatia, a place with a lot of history,That would be so cool to see a concert there. Much more exciting than a football game that only has 11 minutes of live game play.
990,11 minutes doesnt seem like a long time, I heard a team lost 222-0 once, 11 painful minutes,I agree. I always felt like sports players made too much money. I was happy to learn that the average earnings of an engineer are more than that of an NFL or MLB player.
991,I guess engineers study harder and work harder than players, both are reallly rewarding careers.,It is also nice to know that there is no rule against female players, they just need to meet the league's requirements.
992,I wonder why no woman has played in the league then, it must be really hard to meet those requirements and also have a coach that will start you on the team,I think so. Maybe as a kicker women could have more luck. Although it seems unlikely when you hear a New Orleans Saints cheerleader has to leave a restaurant if a player is there.
993,That could work and that is a terrible rule, the NFL should ban that rule, so unfair,I agree otherwise football player should go back t making less than bowlers like in the 1960s.
994,Hi, do you like th NFL?,I do like the NFL. Do you?
995,I do. My favorite team is the Chicago Bears. Do you have a favorite?,I like the Ravens and the Eagles!
996,Both really good teams! Although they only play 11 minutes of game time, I still enjoy it.,That is crazy how short the live game actually is. Did you hear about the tracking chips in players shoulder pads?
997,I did read something about it. Do you know anything about them that you shed some light on for me?,They record a players every move on the field! That is so much data.
998,I know. I wonder what they actually do with the data. Do teams use it or just the NFL.,I am not sure. I bet every sport will eventually have trackers like that.
999,Yeah, maybe except baseball. That seems pretty easy to track.,True. They even have the tracking chips inside the footballs.
1000,I wonder why they still need a chain gang to measure 10 yards then...,I am not sure. I am surprised by they do not have it all computerized.
1001,I get irriated when I watch tennis and they can determine in/out in 7 seconds but the NFL runs out old guys with sticks to determine if it went 10 yards... Seems dated.,I agree. Do you know when the first nfl playoff game was played?
1002,I have no idea. When?,In 1932 on an 80 yard long dirt field.
1003,That's a long time ago! And 80 yards? Were the players out of shape and could only go 80 yards?,I am not sure how it worked. It was in Chicago.
1004,Good evening!  I hope you are well!  How do you think the US would be if the runner up in the presidential race became the Vice President like it was prior to 1805?,hello,  I dont think that would work for our current situation lol Those 2 do not get a long lol
1005,It would be crazy that is for sure!  Maybe our next election can feature a sing-off.  If the President of Indonesia can release three pop music albums, it might just work!  lol,I think that would be quite entertaining!  Thats pretty good,  making albums and running a country,  multi tasking!
1006,It would be the icing on the cake if we could have a President Banana like Zimbabwe did!,lol why?
1007,Just because it would be funny and add levity to what is always so serious.  Trump may seem silly, but  some equate him to a boxer that means business.,I see.  Did you know the presidents guest house is bigger than the white house?  lol
1008,So it pays a little more to be the guest than the actual resident!  LOL,lol right!  Maybe the president of zimbabwe can do a concert there!
1009,Indonesia, but the Zimbabwe president may be just as talented LOL!   I wouldn't mind having some presidential money, but it's surprising to know that the wealthiest were JFK, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson.,Oh sorry indonesia lol That info may possibly be wrong,  last time I checked Trump was the wealthiest by a lot!
1010,I was wondering unless it was adjusted for age, etc.  At any rate, I'm not making anything like that! I'm the kind that needs to have access to free websites and radio stations, though that can come in handy.  Did you know you can listen to thousands of classic radio dramas online without spending anything?,Nice!  Do you like classic radio dramas?  I dont think I would use that service,  I really like audio books.  I gues soliders used to make radios out of pencil and razor!  wow!
1011,That's amazing.  I wonder how they figured that out.  I wonder if they were Canadian if they had to somehow listen to 40% Canadian content like the current law states.  :),probably not,  they were soliders in wwi
1012,I was just joking because I think the law is sort of absurd.  Listen/play what you want.  If that means you try to only pickup radio storms from Jupiter, then so be it.,Oh lol I guess I missed the joke and read it wrong lol Yeah that canadian law is kinda weird,  but they have a lot of good music,  drake,  celine dion, bryan adams lol ...justin bieber
1013,That is a fair point.  Do you watch much television?,Sort of.  I watch a lot of tv shows and movies,  but I usually stream them,  I dont watch real time tv
1014,There are so many options.  Take Pokemon; if you are into that, you can binge like 750 episodes worth!  That is crazy..,Oh my,  that is a lot of episodes!  Great for kids!  I have never watched any pokemon.  Its been great chatting with you!
1015,Hey.  Do you think the Weekly Standard will fail?,Well based on the information I've read it doesn't look good.
1016,Do you think it was directly caused by their Anti Trump stance?,I do. Trump may be unpopular but he is still the Commander and Chief. it was stated that "On a more personal level, with Trump at the head of the party, denouncing him meant jeopardizing decades of investment in a career as a conservative pundit, politician or policy wonk.
1017,I'm not expert, but that sounds like a bad business decision to me,Do you watch a lot of tv programs?
1018,Yes.  I like the show south park.  I have heard the simpsons crew sent them flowers after their family guy episode. LOL,Yeah the Simpsons made way for a lot of other animated adult shows. Did you know "In the first 400 episodes, homer Simpson has held 188 jobs".
1019,I honestly did not know that.  Do you ever use the radio?,Only when i'm driving but even thats not very often. This presidency has given SNL so much to work with, reminds me of the Palin, Biden debates. Those were hilarious.
1020,Yea I liked those too.  Were you ever a fan of pokemon?  It had over 750 episodes!,No i was never a fan but i know of its popularity. I forget what its called but someone got hurt looking for Pokemon
1021,Really.  It was probably that Pokemon "Go" game where you had to hunt Pokemon on your cell phone.  I never played it.,Me either. Did you know that the only U.S president to have a Phd is Woodrow Wilson
1022,No I did not.  Yet he still wasn't one of the top 3 wealthiest presidents.  That honor goes to JFK, Washington and Jefferson.,Check this out, Lincoln was the first president to be photographed for his inauguration and John Wilkes Booth was in that photo.
1023,That is CRAZY.  So awful that Booth assassinated him.  A Coward and a traitor!,You asked me about radio earlier, do you listen?
1024,Sometimes.  I have heard in Canada that laws require radio stations to play at least 40% Canadian music.  What an odd law.,I remember my grandmother telling about a radio show called the shadow. it later became a movie with Alec Baldwin.
1025,Never heard of that movie.  Was it popular?,Yeah for its time. i think it came out in the 80's. hey did you know that one of the most popular radio acts of the 1930s was a ventriloquist, a fact which baffled contemporary critics.
1026,Do you think  what Nick Saban did to the ESPN reporter was ok?,I was wondering the same thing. I think personally that it was definitely wrong to snap even if you have a legitimate reason to be so tense.
1027,Exactly. you can have some sympathy, without telling them what they are asking you, but reposters can be intense.,Yes definitely but it's just general wisdom to try to maintain patience and meet frustrating situations with a level head of course. But then again, he did apologize so it's not like he's some bad guy at all.
1028,Do you think Saban will call the reporter and apologize?,Actually I heard that he already did, or at least someone tweeted as much.
1029,Didn't know. To be honest I am surprised he did.,Oh really, why is that? I'm sure he realized that people would probably be able to empathize with his frustration with the reporters, so why not apologize.
1030,He is definitely not the kind of people who apologize and if he did, I am pretty sure he was being pressure by the media.,Oh, hmm maybe that tweet by James Miller was incorrect I guess. What makes you think he's not the type to apologize?
1031,I am pretty good at telling how people are by the way their behave. And this is not the first time he responds like that.,Oh I didn't know that, when did he do it before?
1032,Almost most of the time he is being interview. That´s why the reporter said: We got it weeks ago, with the exasperated sighs and snarky responses that come whenever you face reporters' questions¨,Oh yes, that's true but at least that's not as explosive as he behaved with Maria Taylor recently.
1033,Really?! What did he did to her? Haven't heard about it.,He snapped at her, and gave an abrasive response to a fair question.
1034,Wow!! That´s way too much. Don´t you think he should be suspended?,I'm not sure, he did apologize at least but I am not so familiar with the context of how they usually punish off the field behavior like that. I guess some sort of penalty would be fair, but maybe not a whole suspension?
1035,You are kind of right, but definitely something underneath is going on with him.,I guess, maybe I don't think it's the big of deal to be upset as long as you acknowledge that it was wrong. A bit of anger can be healthy.
1036,And I have to admit that the reporter was pushing him a little bit.,Yeah exactly.
