            "I wonder if women can play some positions like kicker and punter because size is not really the issue? What about male cheerleaders though?",
            "Cheerleading is really hard! You have to be athletic. I have a male friend who was a cheerleader in high school and he was great at it. ",
            "I've heard that the Saints cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as the players. What up with dat? ",
            "I hadn't heard that! Wow. I have heard that cheerleaders have a lot of strict rules though. Do the football players have a lot of rules they have to follow?",

I guess that good when you think about injuries and the wear and tear on the players bodies and more commercial time to boot!Seems like a short amount of time and yet they stretch it out to 3 hours.  lol  What do you think of the tracking chips that the NFL is putting in the players shoulder pads and footballs to track data?I don't understand why they'd need them on the players, on the ball it seems like they'd be able to track out of bounds, pass the goal line and first downs with that chip. They could either check on the referee's performance or eventually make that the deciding ball placement. I see a lot of use in the tracking chip in the ball.I agree.  Here's an interesting stat: Former Patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled the ball in his NFL career.  Impressive!Yes, I moved to the Boston area 4 years ago so I'm in the heart of Patriot Football and they talk about a lot of football facts year round, but I'd never heard that and that is impressive (assuming he had a normal amount of carries).I knew about Canadian Football, rugby and Austrian rules, had you ever heard about Gaelic Football? I'm not familiar.I can't say that I'm familiar with Gaelic football.  I've never heard of it.That makes two of us, how about those Saints. The don't get the same play by play as the Patriots. No, they don't.  I was surprised to learn that the NFL has no written rule against female players.  I wonder if there will be one in the future. Yes, that's a good point.

Do you know what the highest scoring football game ever was?That 222-0 Georgia Tech over Cumberland, a shame they didn't have a 10 run rule like little league baseball on that one.That's what I call a blowout!  Hahha and then some. Did you know there's only 11 minutes of live play in the NFL game. I guess that good when you think about injuries and the wear and tear on the players bodies and more commercial time to boot!Seems like a short amount of time and yet they stretch it out to 3 hours.  lol  What do you think of the tracking chips that the NFL is putting in the players shoulder pads and footballs to track data?I don't understand why they'd need them on the players, on the ball it seems like they'd be able to track out of bounds, pass the goal line and first downs with that chip. They could either check on the referee's performance or eventually make that the deciding ball placement. I see a lot of use in the tracking chip in the ball.I agree.  Here's an interesting stat: Former Patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled the ball in his NFL career.  Impressive!Yes, I moved to the Boston area 4 years ago so I'm in the heart of Patriot Football and they talk about a lot of football facts year round, but I'd never heard that and that is impressive (assuming he had a normal amount of carries).I knew about Canadian Football, rugby and Austrian rules, had you ever heard about Gaelic Football? I'm not familiar.I can't say that I'm familiar with Gaelic football.  I've never heard of it.That makes two of us, how about those Saints. The don't have any cheerleaders that can eat in the same restaurants as the players, but if the players are there first, the cheerleaders have to leave. That's kind of odd.  I wonder if it's the same in the other NFL cities? I think so, but I'm sure it's not the only rule that makes no sense. Like a 6th round NFL draft pick making more than a 1st"

There's that 17 week regular season, plus the addition of the the playoffs.Yes and with pre-season and the Superbowl it gets long. Did you know that Snoop Dogg wrote a fight song for his son's high school football team?That's interesting--I guess it wasn't a rap, I doubt the fans would have been able to stick to that flow haha. Musicians want to be athletes and athletes want to be musicians, so I guess he gets the best of both worlds. The second-best job for athletes is commentator, though, like those of a lot of football players.I have noticed that a lot of players go on to be commentators. Did you also know that the highest paid Department of Defense employees are three football coaches of the service branch?That makes sense, I guess, although I doubt they'll ever make the money that coaches of Power 5 schools do or be able to trade up to the NFL. I also doubt that any of their players go on to the NFL, but the average lifetime earnings of an engineer (which a lot of students at the academies study) are higher than that of an average NFL player anyway.I would certainly take the engineer career path in that case.

How is it even possible to score that many points in one game?!I'm sure it wasn't a fair fight, given how new the game was back then. They definitely didn't have TV for watching, let alone the superimposed yellow first down line created by ESPN that earned them an Emmy.I'm so glad that invented that. Did you know that the NFL has tracking chips in players shoulder pads and the football?It's amazing that they can use technology to analyze the game so precisely. Can you imagine if there were chips in golf balls to measure all of those movement metrics?That would be amazing. I do wonder why they do not use these chips when making calls instead of relying just on reviews. It's still a game rooted in tradition, I guess, plus someone could probably hack and manipulate the data--that's a can of worms you don't want to open! Plus the reviews take up so much of the time; that's part of the experience, and how people spend over 3 hours watching a game in which there are only an average of 11 minutes of live play.I suppose so.
