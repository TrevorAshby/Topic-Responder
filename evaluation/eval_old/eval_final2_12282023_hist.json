Did you know that the DC in DC comics stands for Detective Comics? person2:I just read that today.  The largest comic book market is in Japan.  I believe it.  My son loves to read those mangas. person1:I would love to go there. I used to like reading Manga too.  person2:The manga market is Japan is valued at $6 to $7 billion dollars! person1:That is wild! Did you know that Michigan State University library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world? person2:I didn't know that.  I wonder how many people use it.  By comparison to Japan, the US comic book market in the US and Canada is $1.09 billion! person1:That's crazy, Japan is way more into comic books than America it seems.  person2:I agree!  The Marvel cinematic universe takes place in earth -199999, a multiverse different from the original comic book multiverse, earth-616! person1:That's pretty wild. Marvel published a \"generic comic book,\" in order to trademark the names \"superhero\" and \"super-villain.\" That was pretty smart of them.  person2:No doubt!  Do you know much about the planets or the universe? person1:I know a little bit. I've heard that Venus does not tilt.  person2:That interesting.  Uranus is different to.  It actually rotates sideways and rolls around the sun rather than spins like the other planets. person1:That's really interesting. I've also heard that Jupiter's moon Ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun.  person2:It must be pretty big then!

I think it's funny there's a bat species called the Chewbacca bat. That's hilarious! person1:I never felt strongly about Chewbacca one way or the other TBH. But I've got to google a picture of that bat to see what it looks like! person2:I would like to see it as well. Did you know Chewbacca actually had a wife and two boys? That's pretty interesting! person1:I vaguely recall reading something in the Star Wars fictional universe where a young Han Solo stayed with Chewbacca and his mom in their home. person2:That's so weird, isn't it? Ha! Are you one of the fans who believes both r2d2 and Chewbacca were secret rebel agents? I kind of think it's an interesting theory.  person1:I wish I knew enough about the background to have an opinion, but the last Star Wars I watched was Episode III, when it came out on video. I really need to rewatch to refresh my memory of it.  person2:Same here! Like, I also had forgotten that before his companionship with Chewbacca, Hans Solo was an imperial lieutenant! person1:Yeah, I don't remember that at all. He definitely doesn't seem like the type. person2:Indeed he doesn't. But I've always liked Chewbacca because he reminded me of a giant dog. Ha! Speaking of dogs, I think it's cool that dogs, along with elephants, are the only animals that understand pointing! person1:I wouldn't be surprised if cats understood it but just didn't care, LOL.",

It's such a rewarding experience and can be life-changing for both you and the animal.",

Dog walking is good because it gives companionship and exercise at the same time. person2:Hey, did you know the first marine predator was the shark? They developed in the Silurian period. person1:Very interesting. I wonder how many aquatic species have gone extinct since then... person2:Or have evolved into other species. The shark has a higher core temperature than other fish because it is an active swimmer. person1:That makes sense. I always thought sharks were pretty interesting because they have cartilage instead of bone. person2:Yes, fascinating fact! Tuna also hold a higher core temperature. They are in the same class as shark because they are also active swimmers. person1:Tuna can get quite large, too. It's cool how big some fish get.",

Hiccups are residual from when we had gills and lungs? Interesting stuff. person1:Never heard that one before, lol! There is a fish called the black swallower that is capable of eating prey twice its length and 10 times its own weight. person2:I knew one of those in my fraternity in college I think. I was shocked to learn there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal. Only creature on earth that can claim that here on the planet. person1:Yeah we all know that guy! how about the loch ness monster being protected under the Scottish 1912 protection of animals act. Creatures of the great deep are extraordinary. \"The immortal Jelly fish.  person2:I already looked up that jellyfish on my phone. Fascinating, yes loch ness is protected and pets in Boulder, Colorado are not owned, but guarded. Interesting how different cultures handle that. person1:Tell me about it apparently there are more U.S. Tigers living as pets than there are living in the wild in Asia. person2:Yes, that is sad in some ways too. Happy we're keeping them alive, probably in zoo but going extinct in the wild is a sad statement on the planet today. person1:I agree. Germany became the first country to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed rights.   person2:While I'm a pet owner, that going a bit far. Do you give dogs and cats rights, how about those dairy cows or cattle to be eaten. Do they get lesser rights? person1:Very good point. My wife and I are watching Blue Planet. It's shocking some of the things that are down in the deep. they are still making discoveries every single day. Apparently the sea horse is the only fish with a neck.  person2:Yes, and really they say we know more about the face of the moon than the bottom of the ocean. Who knows what's down there we don't know?  Maybe the Loch Ness monster's cousin. person1:If you ever get a chance you should check this show, there's some amazing creatures down there. 84% of genes that are associated with diseases have counterparts in the Zebrafish.  person2:I read that and thought the same. I wonder how similar the Zebra Fish is to humans? Can we use that in medical research? person1:If we can i'm sure it will be preventative or medication. There's no money in cures. I didn't realize that we had already cloned a cat and named it Copy Cat, that's too funny. person2:Yes, the scientist in that experiment had a sense of humor. Related to domestication, I had no idea that domesticated animals develop a white patch on their foreheads. I wonder what causes that, it doesn't seem to have any evolutionary reason to me. person1:Sounds strange. I can't fathom why anyone would want a rat for a pet. I'm a little leery of guinea pigs and ferrets. anything with red eyes you can keep.   person2:Haha, yep. A snake doesn't seem very warm or comforting either. I don't understand why people enjoy having them as pets. And how do they find partners who accept it? person1:Other people who like that stuff i guess, haha. Apparently Theodore Roosevelt had 20 pets including a bear and Hyena. I wonder if he played with them much?  person2:Well, President of the United States, I wonder if he had them in the White House? Did he have a stable for the bear out back? person1:Some animals just should be domesticated. That white patch if true is something to ponder.  person2:Yes indeed, interesting facts that will give me pause this weekend. That was an enjoyable conversation.
