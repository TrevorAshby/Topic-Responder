There's that 17 week regular season, plus the addition of the the playoffs.person 2:Yes and with pre-season and the Superbowl it gets long. Did you know that Snoop Dogg wrote a fight song for his son's high school football team?person 1:That's interesting--I guess it wasn't a rap, I doubt the fans would have been able to stick to that flow haha. Musicians want to be athletes and athletes want to be musicians, so I guess he gets the best of both worlds. The second-best job for athletes is commentator, though, like those of a lot of football players.person 2:I have noticed that a lot of players go on to be commentators. Did you also know that the highest paid Department of Defense employees are three football coaches of the service branch?person 1:That makes sense, I guess, although I doubt they'll ever make the money that coaches of Power 5 schools do or be able to trade up to the NFL. I also doubt that any of their players go on to the NFL, but the average lifetime earnings of an engineer (which a lot of students at the academies study) are higher than that of an average NFL player anyway.person 2:I would certainly take the engineer career path in that case. It would certainly be much easier on your body. person 1:Yes, can you believe that in the 60s top pro bowlers made twice as much as footballs players?

Although I went to college at Florida, so I'm actually pretty familiar with huge stadiums. Did you know that the highest scoring football game was a college matchup when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0 in 1916?person 2:Wow! How is it even possible to score that many points in one game?!person 1:I'm sure it wasn't a fair fight, given how new the game was back then. They definitely didn't have TV for watching, let alone the superimposed yellow first down line created by ESPN that earned them an Emmy.person 2:I'm so glad that invented that. Did you know that the NFL has tracking chips in players shoulder pads and the football?person 1:It's amazing that they can use technology to analyze the game so precisely. Can you imagine if there were chips in golf balls to measure all of those movement metrics?person 2:That would be amazing. I do wonder why they do not use these chips when making calls instead of relying just on reviews. person 1:It's still a game rooted in tradition, I guess, plus someone could probably hack and manipulate the data--that's a can of worms you don't want to open!

            "How do you think they will honor Bill Belichick when he retires ? He is a legendary coach.  ",
            "He is, he is  the winningest coach of a postseason, I bet he is in the hall of fame, I hope he stays in the team for a while more.",
            "They can't retire his number, they won't name a new stadium in honor, I guess coaches are made to be forgotten. ",
            "That seems kind of sad, they are the head of the team after all, a team can be good but if they have a bad coach they will paly terribly.",
            "But there is one thing that bothers me with the Patriots, its is the name of their stadium, Gillette Stadium, it is kind of tacky. ",
            "The stadium should have a better name I agree, it must be really expensive though, "
