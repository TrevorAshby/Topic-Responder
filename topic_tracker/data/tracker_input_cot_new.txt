 Actually, I just finished a really interesting documentary about space.
 I don't play video games much, to be honest.
 I'm more of an oldies person, like classic rock and roll.

 I'm not really into TV, sorry.
 Yeah, I've seen "Tenet" recently. It was mind-bending.
 Well, the action scenes were amazing, and the concept of reverse entropy really got me thinking.

 No, I haven't.
 Oh, I love Italian food. Sounds interesting.
 I love pizza. What about you?

 Maybe I will. So, have you seen any good movies lately?
 Hmm, I've never heard of that one before. What's it about?
 Eh, it sounds a little heavy for my tastes. Let's talk about something else instead.
 It's pretty average.
 I like to read a book or watch movies under the blanket.

 Not really, just some grocery shopping and cleaning up the house.
 Honestly, I just want to relax at home.
 You too, thanks.
 It was okay.
 Not really, just stayed home most of the time.
 Just watched some TV and played video games.
 I enjoy crime dramas and comedies.
 Yeah, I loved that show.
 I thought it was satisfying, but a little sad.
 Um, not really. I'm still pretty young.
 I guess so. But let's talk about something else. How's your dog doing?
 No, I don't. I'm not really that interested in taking care of animals.

 Ah, I see. That's too bad. What about sports? Do you follow any teams?

 No, I wish. Work has been keeping me really busy.
 Not really. Honestly, I feel like I'm too busy just trying to keep up with work and everything else, you know?

 Yeah, I guess that works too. Do you like sports?
 Ah, gotcha. I'm a big fan of soccer. Do you have a favorite team?
 No worries. Maybe you'd prefer something else. How about cooking? Do you like to cook?

 I actually just finished a new show on Netflix called "Ozark." Have you seen it?
 Yeah, it's pretty intense. I'd recommend it.
 Not really. I used to be into football, but I've fallen out of it.

 Nothing much. Just stayed at home and binge-watched a TV series.
 Stranger Things. Have you watched it yet?
 I loved it. I am eagerly waiting for the 5th season.
 Hmm, that's alright. What are your favorite genres then?
 Oh, nice! Which rom-com is your favorite?
 Hmm, I think it's just an average show, in my opinion.
 I think the Walking Dead was great!
 Game of Thrones, of course! It's the best show ever!
 Yeah, I agree, but the previous seasons more than made up for it.
 You know, I have to go. I need to finish off some work before the meeting. Talk to you later?
 Yeah, which one are you talking about?
 I haven't seen it, but I heard a lot of good things about it.
 Ugh, that sounds awful. Have you heard about the new art exhibit at the museum?
 It's a retrospective of a local artist who passed away recently.
 I'm doing well, thanks.
 No, I haven't. I don't usually eat out.
 I usually eat at home, but I guess I like Italian food.
 Sounds good. Have you seen any good movies lately?

 I like romantic movies.
 Okay. What do you usually do on weekends?
 I usually just stay home and read.
 Actually, I find it relaxing. Anyway, do you have any pets?
 Oh, I love animals. I have two cats.
 That's cool. I like dogs too, but I prefer cats. Anyway, it was good chatting with you. Gotta go now.

 Sounds boring. I am not really into romantic novels.
 Honestly, I find it hard to understand most of the time. I don't think I have the patience to read poetry.
 Actually, I just watched this really good documentary on environmental conservation. It was really informative.
 It's called "The Biggest Little Farm". You should definitely give it a watch.

 Not really, I've been pretty busy at work.
 I work as an accountant. It's pretty boring, to be honest.

 Oh, cool! I've heard a few of their songs, but I'm not really into that kind of music.

 Alright, take care! See you later.
 Yeah, I just finished watching Stranger Things. It was pretty good.
 Yeah, but I stopped watching it after the sixth season. It just got too gruesome for me.
 I like to play video games and read.
 I just finished a sci-fi book called "The Three-Body Problem". It was pretty interesting.
 Yeah, it's actually a trilogy. But I don't think I'm going to read the other two books.
 No, I haven't had the time or money to travel lately.
 No, I haven't. What kind of food do they serve?

 Really? That's awesome! I've always admired people who can play musical instruments.

 Oh, well as long as it's not that serious. Do you have any weekend plans?
 That sounds like fun. What do you need to buy?
 No, I haven't. Are they any good?
 I don't really have a favorite brand, I just wear what looks good and is comfortable.

 Actually, yes. I just finished reading "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho. It was amazing.

 Books aren't really my thing, to be honest.
 I haven't played any in a while. I'm not really into them anymore.

 Not really, I haven't had much time to watch anything.
 I've been watching a lot of crime procedural shows lately.
 Can't say I have.

 Actually, yes! I just came back from a trip to Japan. It was amazing.
 Well, the food was definitely a highlight. And I got to go snowboarding for the first time, which was exciting.
 No, not really.
 Nothing much, just chilling at home.
 It's all right, but I prefer going out and doing something.
 I like hiking and going to the beach.
 Yeah, I just finished watching Breaking Bad. It was amazing.
 Absolutely. The plot and character development are superb.

 Somewhat. It's fascinating, but I don't always understand it.
 Really? That's pretty cool.
 I don't have any pets at the moment.
 I'm good, thanks.
 Not much, just watching TV.
 Some random reality show, I don't even remember the name.

 I mean, I like to sleep, does that count?
 No, I'm not really into reading.
 Not really, I prefer to stay close to home.
 Probably just staying at home, not doing anything exciting.
 Thanks, you too.
 Yeah, I went to see it last Friday night.
 It was okay, I guess. Nothing too special.
 I'm more of a sports person. I like watching football games on TV.
 I'm a diehard Packers fan. How about you?
 That's cool. What kind of video games do you play?
 Hmm, I'm not really into chess or crossword puzzles. They seem kind of boring to me.
 Not really. I just listen to whatever is on the radio or on Spotify. I don't have any specific preference.
 Yeah, I guess music is okay. But I'm more interested in politics and current events. Have you been following the news lately?
 Yes, I went last winter.
 To be honest, it wasn't really my thing.
 Not really, I'm not much of a swimmer.
 Yeah, I love hiking! There's nothing quite like being out in nature.
 Not really, I just like to explore different trails and see where they lead me.
 Honestly, I don't really pay much attention to the shoes. I just wear whatever's comfortable.
 Not really, I just wear what I like and what feels comfortable.
 Not really, I'm not much of a reader.
 Not really, I don't watch movies very often.
 Yeah, there's this one Italian place that I love. They have the best pasta dishes.
 It was okay.
 Yeah, it wasn't one of our best selections.
 I prefer mystery novels.
 I like Agatha Christie and Raymond Chandler.
 Yeah. I don't like modern mystery novels that much though.
 Not really, I find them a bit boring.
 Sometimes, but I don't really care about them.
 Sure, why not.
 No, I haven't heard about it.
 Hmm, I don't think that's my thing.
 I am a fan of Game of Thrones.
 Nope. I think the ending could have been better.
 Sorry, I don't believe in meditation.
 Well, I am not really interested in discussing this. I have to go now.
 I'm doing okay.
 No, I haven't.
 Huh, I'm not really a fan of pizza.
 I like sushi a lot.
 No, I haven't, but I would love to go one day.
 Hmm, I'm not really into classical music, but I do like hip hop.
 Jay-Z is definitely up there for me. Have you listened to his latest album?
 See you!
 Not really, I'm not much of a reader.
 Sure, I've been watching a lot of crime dramas.
I haven't heard of it, what's it about?
Sounds interesting, I'll have to check it out.
 Oh yes, I saw it last year. It was amazing.
 You should definitely try to see it in person if you get the chance.
 Ehh, not really my thing to be honest.
That's great. I just prefer working out at the gym.
 Not really, just planning on staying in and catching up on some work.
Well, that sounds fun. Who are you going to see?
Yeah, I've heard a few of their songs, but they're not really my thing.
 Actually, I haven't gone to any recently.
 I'm not too picky but I usually go for Italian food.
 I'm not a big fan, honestly.
 I love traveling, but I haven't been anywhere cool recently. The coolest place I've been to is Japan, though.
 Yeah, it's really nice. What about you? Have you traveled much?
 Where have you been?
 Oh, that's cool. I've never been to Boston. What did you think of it?
 Yeah, I feel like a lot of those cities can be pretty overcrowded and touristy. Do you have any pets?
 It was pretty boring, I just stayed at home and watched Netflix.
 I started to watch a new crime series, it's called "Mindhunter".
 Yeah, the storyline is very intriguing. Have you watched it?
 I've heard of that too, but I'm not really into drama series, so I haven't watched it.
 No, not me. What's your favorite type of shows on Netflix?
 Yeah, that's a good one. But I'm not really into sci-fi, so I haven't watched it.
 Yeah, there's been a lot of talk about it, but I'm not really interested in talking about coronavirus.
 Not really. I think I'll just stay at home and relax.
 I'm doing pretty well, thanks.
 No, I haven't. Is it any good?
 Hmm, maybe I will. I'm usually more of a fan of Mexican food myself, though.
 Definitely. Enchiladas all the way. What about you?
 Yeah, guac is great! So, what have you been up to lately?
 Oh, cool. What kind of stuff have you been reading/watching on Netflix?
 Hmm, interesting. I'm not really into fantasy stuff or crime dramas, though.
 Honestly, I don't read or watch much. I prefer to spend my free time outdoors.
 Actually, I'm planning to take a vacation to Hawaii next month. Super excited about that!
 Yeah, it should be a lot of fun. Anyway, I should probably get going now. Nice talking to you!
 I didn't sleep well.
 No, I haven't.
 Not much. I'll probably just stay at home and read a book.
 It's a classic novel called "The Catcher in the Rye".
 It's okay, but not really my style.
 Not really. I don't know how to cook well.
 No thanks. I'm not really interested in cooking.

 I like a few genres, but I wouldn't say I'm passionate about music.

 Yeah, let's switch topics. Maybe we can talk about movies or something?
 I'm good.
 Yep, it was quite stressful.
 Sure, What do you have in mind?
 Not really. I don't watch a lot of movies.
 Classical music is my favorite.
 I don't watch much of TV.
 Well, reading books is something that I enjoy the most.
 Frankly speaking, I don't have any particular preference.
 No, I haven't gone anywhere lately.
 Not great, I had a lot of issues at work today.
 Just a lot of work piling up and a coworker who is difficult to work with.
 Yes, please. How about something more lighthearted, like favorite movies?
 Yes, the plot was amazing. I heard that it was Christopher Nolan's must-watch movie.
 Actually no, I find it quite confusing.
 Not really, I've been rewatching old episodes of Friends.
 I'm not sure, I like both equally. But now I have to go, sorry.
 Not really, I'm not that into sports, to be honest.
 Definitely The Office, I love that show!
 Yes, my favorite movie is Pulp Fiction.
 Yeah, I really love the Beatles.

 I've been trying to meditate and listen to calming music.
 Yeah, I've been trying to make time to work out lately.
 I prefer working out at home.
 Yeah, it's great for stretching and relaxation.
 Well, I'd suggest starting with some beginner videos on Youtube.
 No, I didn't. Who played?
 Oh, I don't really follow baseball.
 Definitely! I love exploring new cities and cultures.
 I've visited Mexico, Canada, and a few countries in Europe.
 No, not really. I find them too scary.
 Honestly, I don't really listen to much music.
 Yeah, actually. I once had to wait two hours on the phone just to speak to a representative. It was terrible.
 No way, I'm never trying that. It's way too scary.
 Not really. I usually try to avoid it when I can.
 Yes, I watched Stranger Things, I loved it!
 Ugh, I watched a few episodes and it was so boring.
 Actually, yes, I watched Parasite and it was amazing.
 Sorry, I don't want to discuss the ending and spoil it for you.
 Not really, I find it boring.
 I like outdoor activities, like hiking and camping.
 Honestly, I have no idea. I've only been camping with my family when I was younger.
 You too! Talk to you later.
 No, I haven't.
 Well, that's not good news.
 Ah no, I don't like chess that much.
 Hmm, I might give it a try then.

 No, I haven't. Hiking is not really my thing.
 Not really. I don't really enjoy watching them or playing them.
 Honestly, I mostly just watch TV or play video games.
 Yeah, I really like Friends.
 Probably Chandler. Who's yours?
 Yes, I loved it.
 To be honest, I like several. But Tyrion Lannister and Jon Snow top my list.
 Of course, but my all-time favourite is "Breaking Bad".
 Yes, I have. And I am currently rewatching it for the third time!
 Absolutely. I think movies are great art forms.
 Hmm, that's a tough one. But if I had to pick one, I would go with "The Shawshank Redemption".
 Yeah, I do. But to be honest, I don't like discussing music as much. It's not really my thing.
 Not really. I haven't been able to travel due to the pandemic. I'm kind of stuck where I am.
 Well, I used to love playing basketball. But again, due to the pandemic, I have not been able to play. It's been a while since I last played. Nothing else comes to mind at the moment.
 Not really. Reading is not my thing, to be honest.
 Mostly just browsing content on the internet or scrolling through social media. Not the most productive thing to do, but it kills time.
 No, I haven't heard about it. What's it about?
 Oh, that sounds interesting. Is it available for PC?
 Oh, too bad. I don't have a PlayStation 4.
 Maybe, but I'm not really into gaming that much.
 I'm into reading and watching movies.
 I like action movies and comedies, but not really horror.
 Yeah, that's a great movie. Heath Ledger did an amazing job as the Joker.

 Yeah, I understand. It's definitely not for everyone.
 You too!
 I'm fine, thanks.
 Not really interested in that.
 I try to avoid fast food.
 Yeah, I watched "The Irishman" on Netflix the other day.
 It was a bit long but overall, I liked it.

 Yeah, I've always wanted to visit Japan.
 No, I haven't even started.

 That sounds great. Do you like hiking?
 Yeah, I can understand that. Any other outdoor activities you enjoy?
 Oh! Do you like taking long walks on the beach, then?
 Oh, okay. Is there any activity you really enjoy doing?
 That's cool. What kind of music do you like?
 Hey! I am a software engineer. What about you?
 Do you watch movies? Any favorites?
 I recently watched "Judas and the Black Messiah." It was quite good.
 Oh, I haven't. I mostly cook at home myself.
 I am not too fond of traveling, to be honest.
 Honestly, I don't listen to music much. I prefer listening to audiobooks.
 Mostly biographies, self-help, and non-fiction books.
 Not really into sports. Sorry!
 Yeah, I have a cute little dog. He's a black Labrador retriever.
 That's great! All right, I have to go now. Nice talking to you.
 It was alright. I didn't really do much.

 It's just an old Chevy. Nothing special.

 Ugh, don't even get me started on work. It's been so stressful lately.
 Not really, I kind of hate it to be honest.
 Yeah, maybe. But it's tough to find something better in this economy.
 It was alright.
 Not really. Just ran errands.
 Just grocery shopping and a few other things.
 Just some basic stuff like bread and milk. Nothing exciting.
 Not really. I'm not very good at it.
 Mostly watch TV.
 Honestly, I don't have one.
 Not my thing.
 Not really, just going to relax at home.
 Yeah, I saw it last night.
 Not really, I thought it was too long and too predictable.

 Yeah, I read this really interesting non-fiction book about the history of chocolate.
 It was called "The True History of Chocolate" by Sophie and Michael Coe.

 Yeah, I just finished watching Breaking Bad.
 Yeah, it was really good. What about you? What's your favorite TV show?
 Oh, I haven't watched that one in ages. Is it still good?
 Honestly, I'm not picky. I'll watch anything from reality TV to historical documentaries.
 Actually, I just saw this new show on Netflix called The Queen's Gambit. It's really well-made and interesting.
 Not really, I'm pretty boring. I just work and watch TV. What about you?

 I'm not really a big reader, so I don't have a specific genre that I like.
 Not really, I'm not really into sports either.

 I guess so. What did you do this weekend?
 That sounds nice. Who was playing?
 No, I haven't. I don't really listen to indie music.
 Not really. I mostly just watch the news.
 I'd rather not discuss politics right now. It's a bit of a touchy subject.

 No problem, take care.
 No, I don't really follow aerospace stuff.
 That's great, have you read any good books about space?
 I thought the movie was better.
 Meh, I think most movies that are based on books are terrible.

 Just wanted to make small talk. I'm not really interested in talking about the weather either.
 Sure, I like to cook and hike. Do you have any hobbies?
 Video games are such a waste of time, don't you think?
 Yeah, I guess so. Hey, I have to go now, but it was nice chatting with you.

 I'm not sure. Do you have a theory?
 Yes, sometimes.
 I'm sorry, I'm not interested in fantasy novels.
 I don't know, the beach can be too crowded.
 No, I don't really enjoy hiking, sorry.
 Sorry, I have a lot of work to do, gotta stay in.

 Same here! See you later.
 No, I haven't.
 Italian food is not really my thing.
 Yes, I love sushi.
 No, not yet. Is it any good?
 That actually doesn't sound very appealing. Fish makes me nauseous.
 I'm not really a big movie person.
 Not really. I prefer reading instead.
 Mostly nonfiction.
 Not really. I prefer books about science and technology.
 I don't really like talking about technology either. Sorry.
 I did. It's all so depressing.
 Exactly. And with social media, it's hard to escape it all.
 Sadly, no. I need to catch up on housework which is incredibly boring.
 That sounds nice! I haven't been on a hike in a long time.
 I would love that! Let's do it.
 Unfortunately, no. I don't enjoy camping very much.
 That may be true, but I prefer a bed and a hot shower at the end of the day.
 Actually, yes, I just finished a great novel by Margaret Atwood called The Handmaid's Tale.
 No, I haven't.
 That's scary.
 Definitely. Speaking of communities, have you found any new friends since moving here?
 I hear you, man. Making new friends can be tough. But it's cool that you found some people you get along with.
 I don't really like movies, to be honest.
 Oh, I hear you. It's been a really tough year overall. I'm just trying to stay positive and make the most of what I have.
 Honestly, I don't want to talk about it. It just stresses me out too much.
 Yeah, it was amazing.
 I really liked the ending.
 No, I haven't had the time.
 Alright, I'll add it to my list. So, have you been to any good restaurants lately?
 I'm not a big fan of sushi.
 Not really, I haven't had any time to plan anything.
 Hopefully. Anyways, I have to get going now. See you later.
 Pretty good, just got back from the gym actually.
 Mainly just weightlifting and some cardio.
 No, I hadn't actually. What kind of food do they serve?
 Hm, okay. Well, let me know if you end up going and how it is.
 Indie? Not really my thing, to be honest.
 Mostly action stuff, to be honest. Not a huge fan of anything too deep or introspective, you know?

 Oh, that's interesting. Well, it was great chatting with you, but I have to go now.
 Not good, I had to go to work early.
 I work as an accountant. It's pretty boring, to be honest.
 I just find it tedious and monotonous to deal with numbers all day. And my boss is always breathing down my neck.
 Yeah, I've been thinking about it. Maybe something more creative or fulfilling.
 Well, I've always enjoyed playing guitar. Maybe I could pursue a career in music.
 I'm pretty versatile, but I mostly play rock and blues.
 Honestly, I don't really have a favorite. I prefer to listen to individual songs rather than whole albums or bands.
 Yes, that's true. I should probably get going now though. Thanks for the chat.
 Yeah, I went to Hawaii last month.
 Yeah, I went snorkeling and saw some amazing sea creatures.
 Definitely! It was an incredible experience. What about you? Have you done any traveling lately?
 Yes, I've been to a few cities in Europe. My favorite was Paris.
 The Eiffel Tower for sure. It was even more impressive in person.
 Not really, I've been pretty busy with work. How about you? Any good books to recommend?
 No, I actually don't really like science fiction.
 Mostly crime dramas or sitcoms. I just watched the new season of "Better Call Saul" and it was pretty good.
 Yeah, definitely. It's a prequel to "Breaking Bad" so there are a lot of references to that show too. You should check it out.
 You too! See you later.
 Not really, I'm not much of a reader.
 I just finished watching Ozark, it was really good!
 Yeah, it's about money laundering for a Mexican drug cartel. It's pretty intense.
 Definitely, I thought Sicario was a great movie.
 I'm really into indie rock. The National is one of my favorite bands.
 Yeah, actually! I saw them a few years ago at a festival. It was an amazing show.
 Not really, I'm not a big fan of festivals. They're too crowded and loud for me.
 No, not really. Traveling during COVID has been pretty tough.
 to be honest, I just like to relax at home and watch Netflix.
 Ugh, not good. My car broke down.
 I don't really want to talk about it.
 Yeah, it's been alright I guess.
 Just work and going to the gym. Not very exciting.
 Mostly cardio and weights. Nothing too fancy.
 I like to watch Netflix, play some video games, and just relax.
 Actually, I'm not really watching anything at the moment.
 Yeah, I've heard about it. I don't really like that show though.
 I like crime shows and documentaries mostly.
 Yeah, that was pretty good. But I think there are better crime documentaries out there.
 Sure, have you heard of The Jinx? It's really good.
 Yes, I actually went on one last year!
 Absolutely! The view was stunning.
 No, I haven't had the chance yet. But it's definitely on my travel bucket list.
 I actually don't know how to surf. But it could be a fun experience.
 No, skiing does not really interest me.
 Honestly, I'm not a big fan of football.

 Actually, I'm not into watching movies lately. I just don't have the patience or time for them.
 I love to read and write. I have a book blog where I write reviews, and I also write poetry sometimes.
 No, I haven't but it sounds intriguing! Have you ever done any screenwriting?
 Wow, that's awesome! I would love to read some of your work sometime.
 Same here, have a great day!
 It was good, I spent most of it working on my garden.
 Mostly vegetables and herbs. I've got some tomatoes, peppers, basil, and thyme.
 Yeah, I do. Do you like tea too?
 Ah, I see. Speaking of coffee, have you been to the new cafe downtown?
 Yeah, it's great. They have really good lattes and a nice atmosphere. Would you like to check it out sometime?
 Alright, that's cool. Speaking of noise, do you like going to live concerts?
 Oh,  that's too bad. Goodbye.
 No, I haven't. What's it called and what do they serve there?
 Sorry, but I'm not really interested. I'm more of a meat person.
 Sounds good. What do you want to watch?
 Uh, I don't really like romantic comedies. How about we watch an action flick instead?
 Maybe we could just grab a drink and catch up instead?
 No, I haven't. What book is that?
 Oh, I'm not much of a science-fiction reader.
 I'm into biographies and memoirs about musicians.
 No, I don't. I just appreciate the artistry that goes into making music.

 Honestly, I think I have to go now. My headache is getting worse. Talk to you later?
 No, I haven't. Is it any good?
 I think I'll have to give it a try then. By the way, have you finished reading that book we were talking about last time?
 Honestly, it wasn't really my cup of tea. It was a bit too slow-paced for my liking.
 I'm into sci-fi and dystopian novels. Have you read any good ones lately?
 I have heard of that one, but I haven't read it yet. So what do you like to do for fun?
 That sounds like fun. I prefer to stay indoors and watch movies or play video games.
 I love playing FIFA. I could spend hours on that game.

 Hmm, doesn't sound interesting to me.

 I recently went to Europe, it was amazing.
 Yes, I loved Paris and Amsterdam.
 You should definitely go, it's as beautiful as everyone says. So, what else have you been up to lately?

 That's okay, I understand. How about politics?
 Not too bad, thanks for asking.
 No, I haven't. What kind of food do they serve?
 That sounds pretty good. I'm always up for Italian food.
 I really like spaghetti carbonara.

 Actually, no. I haven't been to the movies in ages.
 No, I haven't been keeping up with that stuff. I prefer just watching TV at home.

 Not really, just the usual boring routine.

 No way. I'm actually pretty scared of heights.
 Not really. With the pandemic and everything, I haven't been able to go anywhere exciting.
 I do, actually. I've been trying out some new recipes lately.

 Sure, burgers are fine. Would you like to talk about something else?
 I don't know much about it, to be honest. Would you like to talk about something else?
 I don't really care for movies that much. Actually, I have to go now. Been nice talking to you, though.
 Oh, that's cool. I speak a little bit of Spanish, but not fluently.
 Oh, I took a Spanish class in college. It's been a while though, so I'm not sure how much I remember.
 Yeah, it can be challenging, but I think it's worth it.
 Yeah, that's understandable. Hey, have you seen the new show on Netflix?
 Bridgerton.
 You should check it out. It's really good.
 Ah, no problem. Have you been to any good restaurants in the city lately?
 Oh, I see. Well, I tried this new vegan place near my house last week and loved it.
 That's okay. So, have you been reading any good books lately?
 Yeah, I get that. So, what kind of work do you do?
 Oh, that's cool. I work in marketing myself.
 Oh, it was quite boring actually. I just stayed in and read a book.
 Just another detective novel. I'm really into mystery these days.

 I really like Stephen King. His horror novels are the best.
 That's understandable. What about movies? Have you watched any good ones recently?

 Just stuff like Love Island and The Bachelor. It's all really trashy, but it's a good way to unwind after work.
 Yeah, I can see how some people wouldn't be into it. But it's kind of like junk food for your brain, you know? Just indulging in something mindless and fun for a little bit.

 Not really. I've never been much of a sports person. It just doesn't really interest me.

 I have some direct reports, but mostly I work independently.
 Not really interested in that, sorry.
 Yeah, good talking to you.
 No, I haven't watched it yet.
 Well, I'm not really into sci-fi stuff.
 Honestly, I don't watch much TV.
 Not really, I just listen to whatever is on the radio.
 No, I'm not really into sports either.
 Yeah, I'm really into woodworking. I enjoy making furniture and other items.
 Thanks, you too.
 Not really.
 No, not really. I don't watch a lot of movies.
 Actually, yes. I just finished a great science fiction novel.
 It was about a group of astronauts who go on a mission to colonize a new planet.
 Honestly, science fiction isn't really my thing.
 Not really.
 I usually just watch TV or play video games.
 Not really.
 No, I'm not really into sports.
 You too.
 No, I haven't. What's it called?
 Sure, I'd love to! When were you planning on going?
 Hmm, I'm not really a fan of seafood. Do they have any other options on their menu?
 Okay, that sounds interesting. But hey, did you hear about the traffic jam in the city today? It was a complete nightmare. I'm so glad I didn't have to drive anywhere today.
 It's going alright, I suppose. It's been pretty busy, though, and I could use a break. Wait, have you ever heard of the game "Among Us"? It's all the rage these days.
 Yeah, I've been playing it quite a bit lately. It's really addictive. But hey, have you seen the new "Fast and Furious" movie yet?
 No, I haven't. I'll have to look it up. Do you like documentaries?
 No, I don't really watch that show.
 Not really, no.
 Honestly, not really.
 Not particularly.
 I am not an animal person.
 No, I am not really into football.
 Yeah, I like basketball.
 I am not really sure. How about you?
 Ah, I see. When did you start following them?
 He's all right. I visited him last weekend. He loves playing video games now.
 Just some puzzle games. It makes him feel active and stimulated.
 Yeah, they do not excite me much either.
 Honestly, I don't like to read books.
 Nope, I haven't. Sorry.
 Not really, no.
 Actually, I'm pretty interested in hiking. I love to explore new trails and see amazing views.
 Yeah, I've hiked the Grand Canyon before. It was an unforgettable journey.
 No, I haven't.
 Hmm, I'm not really into spicy food though.
 No, I haven't. What makes it so special?
 Hmm, I'll have to try it sometime. So, do you have any plans for the weekend?
 That sounds kind of boring to be honest.
 I see. Well, I was thinking of going to a concert with some friends. Do you like live music?
 There's this indie band called The Kooks that's playing. Have you heard of them?
 Personally, I think so. But I know their sound isn't for everyone. Do you listen to a lot of indie music?
 To be honest, I find classic rock kind of outdated.
 No, I haven't. Tell me more.
 That sounds interesting. I might check it out sometime.
 I have heard of it, but I'm not interested in horror books.
 Not really, I try to avoid the news because it's always so depressing.
 No, I haven't, and I'd rather not talk about it. It's just too upsetting.
 Actually, yes! I'm planning a trip to Hawaii this summer.
 I haven't decided yet, but I'm definitely looking forward to soaking up the sun on the beach.
 No, I haven't. Which one?
 Actually, I'm not a big fan of Italian food.
 I'm more into Mexican food, especially tacos.
 No, I haven't. What's it called?
 Sorry, I can't. I'm actually trying to cut down on my eating out expenses.
 Football isn't really my thing, sorry.
 Not really. My job keeps me pretty busy.
 I'm an accountant. It's not the most exciting job, but it pays the bills.
 No, I'm not interested in that show.
 Not really.
 Not really. I find most movies these days to be pretty boring.
 Yeah, I love reading. What kind of books do you like?
 No, sorry. I don't really read much fantasy.
 Not really. I mostly just listen to whatever's on the radio.
 It was pretty uneventful, to be honest. I didn't really do much.
 Yeah, maybe. Anyway, I'd better get going. Talk to you later.
 Not much, just stayed home and binge-watched Stranger Things.
 It's about a group of kids who become friends and start investigating the supernatural things happening in their town. It's really good.
 Yeah, you definitely should. By the way, have you read any good books lately?
 Well, I just finished this mystery novel that I really enjoyed. But I don't think you'd like it.
 Oh, it's just not really your thing. You prefer more practical books, like self-help or business books, right?
 I know what you mean. Speaking of time, I should probably get going. I have a lot of errands to run today.
 You too!
 It was quiet, just stayed home and watched TV.
 Some old sitcoms. They're pretty fun.
 Not really, I find dramas a bit boring actually.
 I enjoy reading books.
 Mostly non-fiction, like biographies and history books.
 No, I haven't read any novels in a while.
 I enjoy going hiking and exploring nature.
 Not really, sorry. I'm not familiar with any beginner trails in the area.

 Me too. Have you played any VR games yet?
 Oh yeah, I like that one too.

 Sometimes, if they are good.

 Not really, I haven't played video games in years.
 Not really, my last trip was a few years ago.

 Not much, probably just staying in and relaxing.
 Not really, I prefer other types of exercise.
 No, I haven't.
 I do, but I've been trying to cut down on calories.

 It's been stressful. Our boss has been pushing us to meet tight deadlines.
 I haven't really had time to watch any shows.
 No, I didn't.
 Actually, I don't really like to travel.
 Yeah, you too. Talk to you later.
 No, I haven't. How is it?
 Hmm, I'm a vegetarian, so that's not really my thing.
 Not really, just binge-watched Netflix.
 I watched this new documentary about climate change. It was really interesting.
 Not really. I think climate change is important, but I don't know what I can personally do to make a difference.
 I don't have anything planned yet, but I'll probably just stay in and relax. I'm really busy with work lately.
 Yeah, that sounds good. Let's plan something for next month.
 Alright, see ya.
 No, I haven't had time.
 Maybe I will check it out sometime.

 That sounds pretty good, I'll have to check it out sometime.
 Not really, I haven't had much time to go to the movies.

 Not really, the news has been pretty depressing lately.
 No, I'm not really into sports either.
 Actually yeah, I just finished a really good sci-fi novel.

 It's about how humanity reacts when we discover that an alien civilization is planning to invade Earth.

 I really enjoy making pasta dishes. There are endless variations and it's always fun to experiment.
 Not really. I find it boring and tedious.
 Well, I love watching TV shows. I just finished binge-watching "Breaking Bad" again.
 Yes, I have. I thought it was great until the last season.
 No, but what's it about?
 I don't know. That is a little dark for me.
 No, I haven't. I'm not really into her music.
 I'm more of a steak person. Sushi is okay, but I don't have it very often.
 Ribeye. It's so juicy, and it has the perfect balance of fat and meat. Do you like it too, or do you prefer something else?
 Yeah, I have. It's good, but I don't get to eat it often because it's so pricey.
 No, I haven't. Is it really free, or is there a catch?
 No, I haven't. Is it any good?
 Sounds interesting, but I'm really not that into coffee.
 Yeah, I enjoy a good cup of tea every now and then.
 Actually, I have. I don't hate it, but it's not really my thing.
 Not really. I haven't had a lot of time to watch TV lately.

 Not really. I'm not much of a sports person, to be honest.
 Not really.
 I'm not really into art.

 I'm a die-hard fan of Manchester United.
 I like to read books.
 I mostly read crime and mystery novels.
 No, I'm not really into hiking.

 It was amazing! I went to Hawaii.
 We went to the beach, did some snorkeling, and also hiked some of the volcanoes.
 Yeah, I love the beach. I enjoy swimming and relaxing in the sun.
 Well, I like to read books and watch movies. What about you?
 Oh, that's cool. I used to play video games, but I don't have time for them anymore.
 Not really. I find them boring, to be honest.
 No, I haven't. I'm too scared to try anything like that.
 I prefer watching movies at home. It's more comfortable and cheaper.
 Same here. Bye!
 I haven't had much time to watch TV, to be honest.
 Mostly just read books, or sometimes play video games.
 Mostly fantasy and sci-fi, but I'll read just about anything.

 It depends. What kind of books do you like?
 Those are definitely not my cup of tea.
 Not really, I don't really see the point.
 Not really, I like to play sports outside when the weather is nice.
 No, unfortunately, I haven't had the time.

 Honestly, no. I'm not really into sports.
 No, not really. I've been pretty busy with work.

 Not really. I'm not much of a sports person.
 I don't really have a favorite genre. I guess I just like movies that are entertaining.
 Oh, it was some random rom-com my friend made me watch. It was kind of boring, to be honest.
 I like mystery novels. Harlan Coben is one of my favorite authors.
 Definitely check out "The Stranger". It's one of his best.
 Actually, I'm not much of a reader.
 Yes, I recently went to this great sushi place downtown.
 Absolutely. I especially love ramen.
 No, I haven't had the chance to travel much.
 Not really - I've never been a fan of martial arts movies or anything.
 I saw this really boring indie movie the other day.
 I'm really into heavy metal.
 Iron Maiden, hands down.

 Not really, I haven't had much time for reading.
 Actually, I watched Parasite the other day and it was fantastic.

 Yeah, I enjoy them. I think they offer a unique perspective on storytelling.
 Not really, I'm pretty content staying at home for now.
 Not really, I'm not much of a chef.
 Actually, I've been getting into yoga and meditation. It's been really helpful for my mental health.
 Yeah, same to you.
 I'm good, thanks for asking.

 That's interesting, tell me more.
 That's amazing, I wonder if we will be able to visit it one day.

 No, I haven't had the chance to travel much.
 No, I haven't.
 I don't really like sushi that much.

 I like to read and go hiking. What about you?
 That's cool. So, what are you up to later?
 What movie?
 Oh, I don't really like that movie.
 Yes, I went to Japan last year.
 I loved the food and the culture. The temples there are so beautiful.
 Absolutely! I had sushi almost every day while I was there.
 I'm not a fan of liver. It's too bitter for me.
 Not really. I mean, I can make simple things, but I'm not passionate about it.
 No, I haven't. How is it?
 That sounds interesting. I'll have to check it out sometime. By the way, have you seen the latest episode of that new TV show?
 Eh, it's okay. I mean, it's not the best show out there, but it's entertaining enough.
 Totally. Honestly, I find myself watching more and more YouTube videos these days. There's just so much great content out there.
 Oh, all kinds of stuff - cooking videos, travel vlogs, beauty tutorials...you name it!
 Eh, honestly, not really interested in that kind of thing.
 No, I haven't. Is it any good?
 I'll keep that in mind. So how are you doing these days?
 Same here. Work's been keeping me occupied.
 Actually, I lost touch with him a while back.
 I haven't been watching TV lately. I just can't find anything interesting these days.
 Eh, not really. I just listen to whatever's on the radio.
 Yeah, same here. Talk to you later!
 Yes, I've been to Paris. It was amazing!
 I went in the summer. The weather was perfect.
 Hmm, I really enjoyed visiting the Eiffel Tower. It's such an iconic landmark!
 No, I have a fear of heights, so skydiving doesn't interest me at all.
 Nope, also not a fan of heights. Sorry!
 I'm not a great dancer, so I usually avoid it if I can.
 Yeah, I love reading! I'm currently reading a mystery novel.
 I'm a big fan of Agatha Christie. Her writing is very engaging!
 Sure, catch you later!
 Yes, I did. It was a real nail-biter!
 Definitely the quarterback. He made some amazing plays.
 No, I haven't. I've been listening to a lot of podcasts lately.
 Well, I've been listening to one about history. It's pretty interesting.
 Ah, I see. I've never really been interested in science. I can't stand it!
 Ugh, I hate politics. I try to avoid it as much as possible.

 Three weeks. It was enough time to explore the major cities and their surrounding areas.
 Sorry, I prefer to travel alone. Thanks for the offer though.
 Not really, I'm not a big fan of sports.
 Actually, I don't listen to music that much. I'm more into podcasts and audiobooks.
 Not really. I usually watch documentaries instead.

 No, I didn't. Sorry.
 Eh, they're okay I guess.
 I prefer romantic comedies.
 Not really, I haven't had much time for traveling lately.
 I've always wanted to visit Japan.
 I hope so. Anyway, it was nice talking to you, but I have to go now.
 It was great. I went hiking with some friends.
 We went to Mount Baker, it was really beautiful.
 No problem, what do you like to do in your free time?
 What's your favorite video game?
 Ah, I'm not really a big fan of first-person shooters. Speaking of which, did you hear about the recent mass shooting?
 Yeah, it's really frustrating. Did you see any movies lately?
 Haha, I'm not really into action movies. Did anything interesting happen at work today?
 Oh, that's too bad. Looks like we're running out of interesting things to talk about.
 Yeah, I've been playing a lot of Minecraft for the past week.
 I enjoy the creativity and problem-solving parts of the game. It's really fun to build new things and explore the world.
 Yeah, I played that one before, but it's not really my type of game. Have you tried any other shooting games or are you looking for something else?
 Yeah, I've played it a few times, and it's not bad. It's a bit complicated, but if you stick with it, it can be pretty fun.
 I just finished watching Breaking Bad for the first time, and it was amazing. Have you seen that one?
 Definitely. It might take a few episodes to get into it, but it's one of the best shows out there.
 Not really, to be honest. I've mostly just been re-watching some of my old favorites. Like The Godfather, that's always a classic.
 Yeah, it's been a weird year for movies. Hopefully, things will get better soon. Anyway, I gotta run now. It was good chatting with you!
 It's been alright.
 Not really, just plan to relax at home.
 No, I haven't.
 Not really, I usually just stick to my usual places.

 You too.
 No, what restaurant?
 Oh, I'm not interested in organic food.
 I haven't eaten anything exciting lately.
 No, I wish I could go on vacation.
 I like watching movies or playing video games.
 I don't really have one.
 Not really, I prefer documentaries.
 No, I haven't watched anything interesting.
 I usually read books or go for a walk.
 I love classic literature, like Jane Austen's novels.
 I don't really have a favorite season.
 Yeah, it was.
 Not really, no. Not a big movie fan.
 I do like Game of Thrones, but with that ending last season, I'm not sure if I'm interested in watching the final season.
 Nope, not really. I'm not that into cooking.
 I've never seen it. Sorry.
 I used to love playing guitar, but I haven't played in years.
 Yeah, a long time ago, but it wasn't anything serious. Just for fun.
 Oh, I know the feeling. I used to be like that too. Seemed like the longer I played, the less shy I became.
 No, and I don't think I ever will. I'm afraid of heights.
 Not interested in that, either. Seems too risky.
 Yeah, you too. Take care.
 No, I haven't watched it yet.
 That sounds cool. I might give it a try.
 Ugh, I don't really like talking about politics.
 Sorry, I'm not religious. I don't want to go there.

 I'm fine.
 Not much, just stayed at home and watched some TV.
 It was a documentary on Netflix.
 Not really, I prefer to read a book in my free time.
 I mostly read non-fiction books on history or science.
 Oh, really?
 Hmm, that's not my cup of tea. Anyway, I have to go now. Talk to you later.
 It was okay. I didn't do much.
 I just hung out at home most of the time. Watched a few movies.
 I watched a lot, but my favorite was The Shawshank Redemption.
 No, not really. I haven't had much time.
 I tried watching a few, but nothing really caught my attention.
 No, I didn't. Do you recommend it?
 No, not really.
 I really like pizza.
 There's this little place down the street from me that makes really good pizza.
 No, I haven't.
 I'm not really into sandwiches.
 Eh, I'm not a fan.
 I actually haven't had much time for movies lately.
 I'm really interested in video games.
 It's hard to choose just one, but I've been playing a lot of Apex Legends lately.
 That's okay, not everyone is. What do you like to do for fun?
 Yeah, I get that. What are some of your favorite TV shows?
 Hmm, those aren't really my cup of tea. But I did watch this one show on Netflix recently that I really enjoyed.
 It's called Mindhunter. It's about the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit.
 Yeah, I went there for my honeymoon. It was so romantic.
 Paris, definitely. We stayed in a fancy hotel right by the Eiffel Tower.
 Well, we visited the Louvre, and other museums.
 It was a romantic trip, not a party trip. Concerts are not really our thing.
 Not really. I don't have much time for reading these days.
 Yes, I've read some of the books. They're alright, but not really my thing.
 Well, I mostly just read nonfiction now. Books about history and science.

 No, not really.
 Honestly, I'm not really into books, I just said that to make conversation.
 No, I'm allergic to animal hair.
 Not really, I just watch whatever's on.
 No, not really. It was nice talking to you though.
 No, not really.
 I've heard good things about it, but I haven't seen it yet.
 Not much, really. Just hang out with friends and watch movies.
 Yeah, I really like action movies. Stuff like the Fast and Furious franchise or Mission Impossible.
 Not really, I'm kind of behind on the latest releases.
 Actually, no. I haven't been able to afford a vacation in a while.
 It was pretty uneventful, just stayed home and watched Netflix.
 Just some reruns of Friends. I've seen every episode at least a dozen times.
 I've never really gotten into that show, to be honest.
 Actually, I went to see a horror film with some friends over the weekend. It was pretty intense.
 Yeah, I can definitely understand that. I used to love romantic comedies, but now I find them a bit formulaic.
 Not really, I'm not much of a cook.
 Yeah, that's definitely me. Anyway, I think I need to head out now. Got some errands to run. See you later!
 Yeah, I just finished watching Money Heist. It's pretty cool.
 It's a heist show, but it's really well done.
 Definitely. It has great characters and an exciting story.
 How about travel? Do you like to travel?
 Ah, got it. How about food? Do you have a favorite restaurant in town?
 Oh, okay. Well, what do you like to do in your free time then?
 Hmm, I see. That's cool, I guess. Hey, it was nice chatting with you, but I have to go now. See you later!
 Not really, I'm not much of a reader.
 Yeah, I saw this really good thriller movie a few weeks ago.
 Ah, I don't really like watching documentaries.
 Not really, I don't watch TV that often either.
 No, I'm not really into gaming either.
 Honestly, not really. It's all been pretty depressing lately.
 No, I don't really have the time or space for one right now.
 Yeah, take care.
 No, I haven't had the chance yet. How is it?
 Hmm, I'm not really a fan of Italian food.
 I really enjoy sushi. Have you tried any good sushi places around here?
 Yeah, let me know if you find any good places. Oh, by the way, did you hear about the new tax changes coming up?
 I don't know, it depends on how much you're making. But it's supposed to affect a lot of people.
 Actually, I'm not really a fan of movies. I prefer reading books.
 Well, it depends on what you like. Do you prefer fiction, non-fiction, or something else?
 Hmm, I can't really think of anything off the top of my head. Sorry.
 Nah, I don't really care about museums.
 Not much, just trying to stay busy with work and stuff. How about you?
 Not great, my dog got sick.
 A little.
 No, I haven't.
 Eh, I'm not a big fan of Italian food.
 I watched this really boring indie movie last week. I don't even remember the name.
 I already watched it, but I have to admit it was good.
 Not really, I've been too busy with work.
 I don't really watch that show.
 Actually, I watched a great documentary about whales the other day.
 I learned all sorts of stuff, like how they communicate with each other and the different types of sounds they make.
 Yeah, but to be honest, I'm not a big fan.
 I like to play video games and read books.
 Mostly science fiction and fantasy, but I also enjoy reading historical biographies.
 Yeah, I do. But there are some movies in those genres that I didn't like at all. For example, I couldn't stand the latest Star Wars movies.
 Yep, that's true. Say, I think I have to go now. It was nice talking to you.
 It was fine, just stayed at home.
 No, I was not in the mood.
 Not really, I'm not really into reading.
 I don't know, anything else?
 No, I haven't traveled much.
 Not really, just work and chores as usual.
 Not really, I'm pretty busy with work all the time.
 Yeah, that sounds good.
 Yeah, I just finished watching Bridgerton. It's a great show.
 I loved the costumes and set design. It's really impressive.
 Yes, I went to Italy last year. It was an amazing trip.
 I loved the food and the architecture. But let's talk about something else, shall we?
 Not really, no. But speaking of something not so interesting, I watched a really bad romantic comedy last night.
 It's called "Blended." It's really formulaic and predictable.
 No, I haven't.
 Thanks, maybe I will.
 Yeah, I do.
 I don't go to the movies that often but if I had to choose one, I'd say The Dark Knight.
 Yes, I really like 1984.
 I guess it’s a matter of perspective. What was your least favorite book?
 Yeah, I can imagine. By the way, I need to go now. It was nice talking to you.
 It was good. I visited my hometown.
 Not much, just spent time with my family and friends.
 Yes, I loved it.
 Not really, but I do find it interesting.
 Yes, I love video games.
 Yes, I like playing FIFA.
 No, I haven't watched any movies recently.
 I don't really like horror movies. It's too scary.
 Yeah I like comedy movies. They are always a good source of laughter.
 Yeah, I like Dave Chappelle.
 Nice to talk to you too. See you later.
 Not really. I mean, I can make some easy dishes, but I don't consider myself a good cook.
 Hmm, I don't really bake that often, but I do enjoy it occasionally.
 I like making cupcakes and cakes. Sugar cookies are also good, but it's a bit too much work.
 It's going okay, I guess. Not that busy lately, which is good and bad at the same time.
 Actually, I watched a really interesting documentary about the history of cooking. Have you ever heard of it?
 Oh, that's fine. Do you have any pets?
 I see. Well, it was nice talking to you, but I have to go now.
 No, I haven't had time to read much lately.
 What other things do you like to do?
 I'm not really into anything specific, to be honest. I just like to hang out with friends and watch TV.
 I haven't really been watching anything lately, just re-watching old episodes of The Office for the hundredth time.
 No, I haven't, and I don't really plan on it. I'm not a big fan of horror or sci-fi.
 Actually no, I haven't been to a concert in years. I'm not really that interested in music, to be honest.
 No, I haven't. I'm not really interested in crowded events like that.
 Not really, I don't really follow sports that closely.
 You too, take care!
 Yes, I went there last weekend.
 It was alright. The food was decent, but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it.
 It was a fusion of Asian and Mexican food.
 I tried the Korean tacos and they were not great.
 Not that I noticed. The menu seemed pretty standard to me.
 Yeah, I wouldn't recommend it. Anyways, did you end up going on that trip you were planning?
 I'm fine, thank you.
 Not much. Just watched some Netflix.
 I watched Money Heist. It's a Spanish crime drama. Have you ever watched it?
 Me too. Have you watched the Hangover?
 That would have to be Alan Garner. He's hilarious.
 Sorry, I'm not into them. I don't find them very amusing.
 Not necessarily. I sometimes like to read books, but not always.
 I'm not really into reading, to be honest.
 No, I haven't traveled anywhere recently.
 I don't really have a dream destination. I'm not really into traveling.
 You too.
 No, but I've always wanted to go.
 I'm not really into that kind of stuff, to be honest.
 No, I'm not really into hiking either.
 Actually, I haven't really watched any movies lately. I've been catching up on some TV shows, though.
 Mostly crime dramas and thrillers. I just started watching "Mindhunter" on Netflix. It's pretty good.
 Yeah, you should. Listen, it was nice talking to you, but I have to go now. Talk to you soon!
 No, I didn't. I'm not really interested in sports.
 Actually, I've been there and it's not as good as everyone says. I wouldn't recommend it.
 The food was overpriced and nothing special. But if you're looking for some good sushi, there's a new place that just opened up here.
 Just some toast and coffee, I keep it simple.
 That's cool. I don't mind pancakes, but I don't have much time in the mornings.
 Actually, I haven't watched anything new recently. I've been re-watching The Office for like the fourth time.
 Not really, I mostly just read textbooks for school. But I have a friend who's into some really interesting philosophy books, if that's your thing.
 Not really. I just need some time to relax and recharge.
 Oh really? Which one did you read?
 Oh, I've read that one before. I liked it too.
 Yeah, I felt the same way.
 Not really. I find them quite boring, to be honest.
 Yeah, I do. What movie are you planning to watch next?
 No, thanks. I hate horror movies. They scare me too much.
 I'm into action and adventure movies. How about you?
 Hmm, I'm not a fan of those. They're quite predictable and cheesy in my opinion.
 No, I haven't. I don't really like Italian food.
 That may be so, but I'm not a fan of carbonara either. Sorry to disappoint you.
 No, I don't think I'll be traveling this year. I'm kind of low on budget.
 I'm good, thanks.
 No, not really.
 I don't watch much TV either.
 No, I find it pretty boring actually.
 Not really, I'm not much of an athlete.
 No, I've just been staying at home mostly.
 I like to paint and draw in my free time.
 Yeah, I really like Frida Kahlo and Van Gogh.
 No, but I've been wanting to go to the MoMa in New York.
 Yeah, definitely. Looks like I gotta go now. It was nice chatting with you.
 Yeah, I did - it was intense.
 The Red Sox, of course. What about you?
 Oh okay. Do you play any sports yourself?
 That's cool. So, have you seen any good movies lately?
 Oh, that's alright. How about TV shows?
 Oh, cool. I've been watching Stranger Things recently. Have you seen it?
 Actually, I'm not too into music.
 Yeah, you too. Have a good one.
 No, what is it called?
 Yeah, I love it. What's your favorite dish?
 Yeah, I have. It never turns out as good as when you order it from a restaurant.
 Not really. The latest movies have been kind of boring.
 I've been watching this new show called "Squid Game." It's pretty intense.
 It's about a group of people who play children's games for money. But if you lose, you die.
 No, not really. With everything going on, it was hard to plan anything.
 Yeah, hopefully. Anyways, it was nice talking to you, but I gotta go now.
 No, I haven't. It sounds scary.
 I don't think so. I don't like heights.
 I like all kinds of music, but my favorite is probably pop.
 Probably Taylor Swift.
 Yeah, I don't really like her music.
 Not really. I haven't had time to go to the movies.
 Not really. I mostly just watch sports.
 Mostly basketball and football.
 The Los Angeles Lakers.
 Oh. Well, I guess they're okay. I'm not really into them though.
 Yeah, I guess not. Hey, I actually have to go now. Nice talking to you though.
 No, I haven't.
 Not really.
 I love sushi!
 That sounds good to me.
 No way. I'm petrified of heights.
 Same thing.
 I'm not really into sci-fi.
 Rom-coms aren't really my thing either. Sorry.
 Yeah, I love Game of Thrones.
 Same. But I gotta go now. Talk to you later?
 It's been pretty busy at work.
 I'm an accountant.
 Yeah, not everyone enjoys it. So, what do you like to do in your free time?
 I'm not much of a reader, but I do like watching movies. Have you seen any good ones lately?
 Oh, that's a classic! Definitely one of my favorites.
 I really enjoy horror movies. But they have to be well-made and not too predictable.
 Yeah, I can see how they're not for everyone. Do you like sports?
 I used to be into football in high school, but not so much anymore. So, what kind of music do you like?
 Same here, actually. I love discovering new indie bands. Right now, I'm really into The Strokes.
 Which game are you talking about?
 Sorry, I didn't watch it. I hate basketball.
 Actually, I'm not really into movies. I find them boring most of the time.
 Well, I guess some documentaries can be interesting, but overall documentaries are not my cup of tea.
 To be honest, I don't really listen to music that much. I find it distracting when I'm working.
 I usually just read books or articles online.
 I'm interested in science and technology, so I mostly read books about those subjects.
 Sorry, I haven't. I'm not really that interested in space exploration.
 Oh boy, here we go. Personally, I try to avoid talking about politics as much as possible.
 No, I haven't. I'm not really into sci-fi.
 Mostly dramas and romantic comedies, but I'll watch just about anything except horror movies.
 I mostly read non-fiction, like biographies and history books. I think fiction can be a bit boring.
 I'm really interested in World War II. Do you have any pets?
 Yeah, I have a dog. He's a golden retriever and he's the best thing that's ever happened to me. What's your favorite kind of food?
 I'm a bit of a health nut, so I mostly eat salads and grilled chicken. I used to love junk food, but I cut it out when I started working out. Have you been to the gym lately?
 I mostly do cardio, like running and cycling. I find weightlifting kind of boring. Anyway, I've got to go now. Nice talking to you.
 No, I haven't had a chance to go yet.
 That sounds pretty interesting. Who is the artist?
 Wow, I'm actually really interested in that. I've been trying to become more eco-friendly lately. Maybe her work will inspire me.
 Oh, sure. For example, I carry a reusable water bottle with me everywhere I go, and I try not to use plastic bags whenever possible.
 Uh, sorry to cut this short, but I have to go now. It was nice talking to you!
 Not really, I find it boring.
 Yeah, I understand that. Have you seen any good movies lately?
 Oh, I've never seen any James Bond movies.
 Not really, I don't have much time for TV shows at the moment.
 Yeah, I've heard of it. But, I'm not interested in sci-fi shows like that.
 I don't really have a specific preference. I just listen to whatever's on the radio.
 Sorry, I don't really know much about classic rock. I find it quite boring.
 No, not really. I usually just order takeout most of the time.
 That's cool. I just can't be bothered to do it most of the time. Anyways, it was nice talking to you, but I have to go now.
 I don't really drink much anymore.
 I guess that's interesting. What was in it?
 Hm, okay. I'm not really into whiskey, so I don't know much about it.
 I'm into electronic and hip-hop music.
 I can see why you might think that, but there's actually a lot of variety within the genre.
 Yeah, I'm really into Aphex Twin and Autechre.
 Not really, but they're highly respected in the electronic music community.
 Yeah, it's definitely my favorite genre.
 Honestly, I'm not a huge movie buff.
 I guess that's interesting. What was it about?
 That sounds pretty intense. I don't think I could handle watching something like that.
 I am doing good.
 I went on a road trip with my friends.
 We went to the beach. It was really relaxing.
 No, not really interested.
 Yes, I really love hiking. I go on a hike at least once a month.
 I like doing long-distance hikes. I recently completed a 5-day hike in the mountains.
 Yeah, it takes a lot of preparation and training. But it's totally worth it.
 Yeah, that's cool too. What kind of exercises do you usually do?
 Oh, I see. I used to do weight training as well, but it didn't really click for me.
 I am going to visit my grandparents. They live in a rural area, and I usually help them with some chores.
 Yeah, that's a good idea too. By the way, have you watched the latest season of Stranger Things?
 I watched this French movie called Amelie. It was really nice.
 Yeah, definitely. Alright, it was nice talking to you, but I have to go now.
 It was fine, just work stuff.
 I mean, it pays the bills.
 Honestly, I have no idea.
 No, I haven't.
 Not really, it's too much of a hassle.
 Nope, I'm not really an animal person.
 No problem.
 Not really, I'm not much of a sports fan.
 Actually, yes! I just finished a great sci-fi book.

 Oh, I haven't read that one yet. Would you recommend it?
 Umm, I'm not a big fan to be honest.
 Nope, not really into that either.
 Actually, let's change the subject. I'm not really interested in discussing politics right now.
 Sound good to me! I could talk about food for hours...
 It was alright, nothing too eventful happened.
 No, I haven't.
 Oh, that sounds interesting. I love sushi.
 I like salmon nigiri the most. What about you?
 Ah, I see.
 Honestly, I'm not too big on trying new foods. I usually stick to what I know.
 Yes, I watched a cool documentary on Netflix about nature.
 Yeah, it's fascinating to learn about all the different animals and ecosystems out there.

 I like to read or watch some TV shows. What about you?
 Hmm, taking a bubble bath sounds nice.
 No, I don't. Do you?
 That's nice. I used to have a dog, but I had to give him away because of my allergies to pet dander.
 Oh, I hate boring shows. I'd rather watch something with a good story or action.
 No, I haven't. I don't really like that kind of stuff.
 Yeah, I can imagine. Anyway, it was nice chatting with you, but I have to head off now.
 Not really, I've been trying to avoid all the negativity.
 No, I didn't. What happened?
 Wow, that's really amazing. I hope it gets tested and approved soon.
 Not as much as I would like, but I'm trying to make it a habit.
 I'm really into yoga and Pilates. What about you?
 Yeah, it's really good for strengthening your core and improving your flexibility. But to be honest, it can be kind of boring sometimes.
 Not really. To be honest, I'm kind of tired of all the superhero movies and remakes that are coming out.
 Hmm, I haven't. What's it about?

 Not really, to be honest.
 Nah, I don't really get to travel much these days.
 Not really. Honestly, I'm kind of bored of TV and movies lately.

 Yeah, maybe you're right. But it's just not my thing.
 I don't watch much TV, but I did see a documentary about climate change recently. It was pretty eye-opening.

 That sounds interesting. I love pizza.
 Definitely. So, what have you been up to lately?
 Same here. Nothing too exciting.
 Ugh, no, I've been trying to avoid looking at it. I hate reading reports.

 I'm a big fan of jazz music, especially Miles Davis.
 Sure thing! You should definitely check out "So What" and "All Blues". They're classics.

 Not really, no. I'm not much of a sports person.
 I love to read. I'm currently reading "Sapiens" by Yuval Noah Harari. It's a really interesting book.
 It's about the history of humankind, and how we've evolved to where we are today. It's a fascinating read.
 Yeah, I guess it's not for everyone. Speaking of history though, have you ever been to Europe?
 Oh, you should definitely try to make a trip over there sometime. The history and culture is amazing.
 No, I haven't. What's the place called?
 Oh, I'm not really into vegan food.
 Not really. I've been pretty busy with work.

 Not really. I'm not a big sports person.
 I don't know. I think I need to get going anyway.
 Not really, I haven't had much time for reading lately.
 Actually, yes. I've been really into the show "Breaking Bad".
 How about "Stranger Things"?
 No, it's been out for a few years now.
 I really like the characters and the storyline. It's a really well done show in my opinion.
 Not much, really. I work a lot, so I don't have a ton of free time.
 I don't really like sports, and exercise is just something I have to do to stay healthy, not something I enjoy.
 Yeah, you too. See you later.
 No, I don't really like it.
 I'm into documentaries, mostly about nature or history.
 No, I haven't. What else do you like to watch?
 Hmm, they're not really my thing. What about movies? What's the last movie you watched?
 No, I haven't. I'm not really a fan of sci-fi movies, to be frank.
 Hate to break it to you, but I'm not a fan of those either. In fact, I find them a bit boring. Is there something else you'd like to talk about?
 Sorry, I'm not really into sports either. How about we talk about something else?
 Actually, I just got back from a trip to Europe. It was amazing.
 I went to Spain, France, and Italy. Each country was unique, and I enjoyed them all.
 Sure, sounds good. Talk to you later!

 Just work and errands mostly.
 Not really, just plan to relax and catch up on some sleep.

 Not really, I've been pretty busy with work lately.
 I'm a salesperson for a technology company. It's not the most exciting job, but it pays the bills.
 Not really, I'm not much of a gamer.
 I like to read and go hiking.
 Not really, I prefer to read or spend time outside.
 Yeah, same here. Take care.
 Pretty good, thanks. How about you?
 Oh, I work in accounting. It's pretty boring, to be honest.
 I'm really into playing video games.
 Yeah, it can be tough to find time for things when you're busy.
 No, I've never really had the opportunity to travel much.
 Yeah, I've always wanted to travel more. Maybe someday.
 Of course, who hasn't? I'm not really a huge fan of it, though.
 Honestly, I'm not a super adventurous eater. I pretty much stick with burgers and fries.
 Yeah, I've tried it a few times, but it's not really my thing.
 Not really, I was just planning on staying at home and relaxing.
 Thanks for the offer, but I think I'll pass. I'm not really much of an outdoorsy person.
 I'm good, thanks.
 No, I haven't had a chance to go see it yet. What movie are you talking about?
 Oh, yeah, I heard about that one. I'm not a fan of his though.
 I'm not really into movies that much. Do you have any other topics in mind?
 No, I haven't had the time or money to travel lately.
 Nope, I'm not really into sports.
 I mostly just hang out with friends and watch TV.
 I mostly just watch reality shows. I find them really entertaining.
 Not really, I'm pretty boring.
 You too.
 It was pretty uneventful. I just stayed at home and watched some TV.
 I watched Friends for the hundredth time.
 Yeah, Joey is funny. But I can't stand Ross. He's so annoying.
 Not really, to be honest, I'm not a big fan of sushi.
 Pretty good, thanks.
 Not really, just saw a really bad one last night.
 It was called "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes". Truly awful.
 No, I've been pretty lazy the past few weeks.
 Definitely. So, what do you like to do for fun?
 Honestly, I don't really have any hobbies.
 Not really, I'm pretty boring.
 Not really, I don't eat out too often.
 I tend to stick to pretty basic stuff, like pasta and chicken.
 Ah, got it. Well, I hate vegetables, personally.
 Yeah, you too. Have a good one.
 Yes, I did. It was pretty average.
 Sure, sounds good.
 Hmm, I don't know. You pick a place.
 I'm not really a fan of Chinese food.
 Yeah, sure. I love Italian food!
 No, I'm not really interested in sports.
 I love reading and playing video games. What about you?
 Sorry, I'm not really interested in movies.
 Yeah. Sorry, it seems like we don't have many common interests to talk about. Anyway, I gotta run now. See you soon!
 It was alright.
 No, I haven't.
 I am not a big fan of Italian food, sorry.
 Sure, I love Chinese food.
 Actually, I am not into his music style.
 I am more of a classical music person.
 No, I prefer listening to music on my own. I do not find live concerts enjoyable.
 Not really, I have been too busy with work lately.
 I do not prefer to travel on weekends.
 Sure, that could be better. Would you like to discuss recent book releases?
 Pretty uneventful honestly.
 No, I don't really like coffee.
 I actually do like tea quite a bit. My favorite is Earl Grey.
 No, I'm not really into tech stuff.
 I don't really watch many movies, to be honest.
 Not really. I'm not much of a sports person.
 Mostly just read and hang out with my cat, to be honest.
 Mostly classic literature, like Dickens and Austen.
 Yeah, you too.
 It was great. I went to a baseball game with some friends.
 No, not yet. I'm not really into superhero movies.
 I love concerts. I just went to a music festival last week.
 I saw a lot of great bands, but my favorite was probably Arctic Monkeys.
 No, unfortunately. I'm pretty busy with work right now.
 Not really, to be honest. It's been pretty stressful lately.
 Sure, how about sports? Do you follow any teams?
 Actually, no. I've been pretty busy with work and haven't had much time to eat out.
 Sure, that sounds good. Thanks.
 Bye!
 I'm doing pretty well, thanks.
 Actually, no, I haven't. I don't watch much TV.
 Not really, no.
 I don't listen to a lot of music, to be honest.
 No, I haven't traveled anywhere recently.
 Not really, no.
 No, I'm not really into sports.
 Not really, sorry. I think I'm going to head out now.
 I'm doing alright.
 Oh, I don't drink coffee.
 I don't really drink alcohol that much.
 Not really. Movies aren't really my thing.
 I like reading and hiking, and spending time with my dog.
 I really like hiking in the mountains. There are some beautiful trails around here.
 No, just around here for the most part.
 No, actually, I haven't had the chance to travel since the pandemic started.
 Italy sounds amazing, I'd love to try their famous gelato.
 I work in a software company.
 That's interesting. What kind of stuff do you write?
 Wow, that does sound pretty interesting.
 No, I'm allergic to most animal fur.
 That's great. What's his name?
 Aw, that's so cute.
 Not really, I'll probably just stay at home and binge-watch some shows on Netflix.
 Oh, that's great. I'm not really much of an outdoorsy person, though.
 It was okay. Not much happened.
 I guess the most interesting thing I did was go out to eat with some friends.
 Just to a little Italian place. It was pretty good.
 I'm not sure, I like a lot of different things. Probably either spaghetti carbonara or eggplant parmesan.
 Yeah, I've had it a few times. It's not really my thing, though.
 Not really, I haven't had much chance to travel lately.
 Oh, just hang out with friends mostly, watch TV, play some video games. Nothing too exciting.
 Hey! What's up?
 I'm a student, so my day was easier than yours!
 I'm majoring in computer science.
 Yeah, it can be a very profitable field. But it's not just about the money, you also need to have a passion for it.
 Not really, I'm a pretty boring person to be honest. I just study and watch TV.
 I don't watch anything in particular, just whatever's on. But I don't really like reality shows, they're kind of fake.
 No, I haven't. I heard it's good though.
 No, I've never been outside the country. I would love to someday though.
 Not really, I'm open to anything. But I don't like crowded places or tourist traps.
 Sure, take care!
 No, I'm not really interested in sci-fi movies.
 Yeah, I'm definitely not in the majority there. What about comedies? Do you like those?
 Eh, I don't mind them but I don't actively seek them out. I'm more into dramas and thrillers.
 Can't say that I have... I'm not really big into reading these days.
 Actually, I just finished binge-watching this series on Netflix. It's about these high school kids in the 90s who start a skateboarding team. It's really good.
 Oh, I hate time travel movies or TV shows. They never make sense and just end up being confusing.
 Honestly, I don't really have any hobbies. Mostly just work and then vegging out in front of the TV or computer.
 Not really, I don't eat out much. I prefer to cook at home.
 Mostly just simple stuff - pasta, stir-fries, that kind of thing. Nothing fancy.
 No, I haven't.
 Yeah, I've had it a few times.
 It was pretty good, but I'm not a big fan of spicy food.
 Definitely savory.
 Oh, not really into the whole pumpkin spice craze.
 Yeah, there's this small independent one that I really like. They roast their own beans and everything.
 Anything that's locally owned and operated, really. I like to support small businesses whenever I can.
 Well, I like to read and hike when I have free time.
 No, I haven't. I'm not really a big fan of camping, to be honest.
 Yeah, same to you. Have a good day!
 No, not really.
 Yeah, I love hiking! Especially when the weather is good.
 No, I haven't. But I've heard it's amazing.
 Not really, I'm saving money right now.
 Oh, I mostly just watch TV and play video games.
 Just some sitcoms and dramas. Nothing too exciting.
 Not really. I mostly watch whatever is popular or recommended to me.
 I'm not really into music.
 Yes, I went to Hawaii last year.
 It was beautiful but very expensive.
 I did, actually. I had a really great poke bowl.
 No, I don't really like the idea of eating snails.
 I love sushi! It's one of my favorite foods.
 I actually don't watch much TV, so I don't really have a favorite.
 Not really, I've been too busy with work to read much.
 It's fine, nothing too exciting. How about yours?
 You too!
 No, I haven't.
 I'm not really into Thai food, so I don't think I would like it.
 Yeah, I really like the Italian place around the corner.
 I always get their spaghetti carbonara. It's the best.
 To be honest, I don't really care for pizza.
 No, I don't. Sorry.
 Not really, I haven't had much time for movies lately.
 Honestly, I'm not that into movies.
 I really don't watch much TV either.
 I wouldn't say that. I just don't spend much time on it.
 Not really, no.
 Actually, I enjoy hiking from time to time. I find it relaxing.
 It was great, thanks for asking. I went to the beach with my family.
 We just relaxed in the sun, went swimming, and had a picnic.
 No, I haven't read anything lately, what about you?
 Hmm, I'm not really into biographies or anything like that.
 Not really, I don't go to the movies that much.
 No, I just watch sports most of the time.
 Mostly football and basketball.
 No, not really. I'm just going to stay home and relax for a while.
 You too. Talk to you later.
 Yeah, I went to a beach in California.
 No, I am not a big fan of surfing.
 Actually, I did a lot of hiking. I climbed one of the tallest mountains there.
 Uh, I don't remember the name. But it was really exhausting.
 Yeah, I tried some authentic Mexican food. I'm not a big fan of spicy food, but it was alright.
 Yeah, I love Italian food.
 Uh, I don't really have one.
 No, I don't really watch movies.
 Mostly just reading books and playing video games.
 Mostly sports games, like FIFA and Madden.
 Cool, I've heard of it. I haven't really played any RPGs.
 Nah, that's fine. I'm good with sports games. And, actually, I should be going now. Nice chatting with you.
 Not bad, just feeling a bit tired.
 I like a little bit of everything, but mainly I listen to pop and hip hop.
 Yeah, I really like Beyonce and Ariana Grande.
 Oh, I don't really watch movies, to be honest.
 I don't really watch TV either, sorry.
 Not really, I haven't been able to travel for a while now.
 Yeah, I like to read and play video games when I have the time.
 Well, I read mostly sci-fi and fantasy, and I like to play RPG and strategy games.
 No problem, talk to you soon!
 Yes, I went to this Italian place last week.
 I had pizza and pasta. The pizza was pretty good, but the pasta was too salty.
 No, I haven't. I'm not really into that kind of show.
 Actually, no. I haven't been to the movies in a while.
 I don't really have a favorite. I just listen to whatever's on the radio.
 Honestly, I'm kind of boring. I just read books and go for walks.
 Mostly non-fiction. I find biographies and historical books interesting.
 Yes, it was nice chatting with you too. Have a good day.
 Yeah, I try to hit the gym at least three times a week.
 I usually focus on weight training and strength exercises.
 Yeah, I can understand that. Have you tried any fitness apps to help you stay on track?
 Fair enough. So, have you been watching any good shows or movies lately?
 Yeah, I know how that goes. What kind of work do you do?
 Yeah, it definitely keeps me on my toes. Speaking of which, I should get back to work. Nice chatting with you though!
 Nothing special. Just been working from home all day.
 I'm an accountant. But let's talk about something else. What did you do over the weekend?
 That sounds fun. What shows did you watch?
 Oh, I heard about those shows. But honestly, I'm not really interested in watching TV shows right now.
 Yeah, I do. I've been reading this book called "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People". It's quite good.
 That's okay. We don't have to like the same things. Anyway, I have to go now. Nice talking to you!
 Yeah, I love basketball.
 I'm a big fan of the LA Lakers.
 Yeah, I do. I'm really into science fiction.
 Sorry, I'm not interested in documentaries.
 I like classical music.
 Not really, sorry.
 No, I don't. I'm not really an animal person.
 I don't really have one. Sorry, I'm not interested in movies.
 Not really, sorry.
 Sorry, I don't think that's a good idea. I am afraid of heights.
 Sure, I love going to the movies. What's showing?
 I am not a big fan of horror or thriller movies, can we watch something else?
 I'm more of a romantic-comedy person. Do you like those?
 Have you watched "Crazy, Stupid, Love"? It's one of my favourites.
 Not really. With the current state of the world, I don't feel safe travelling anywhere.
 What about you? Any plans?
 No, what's it called?
 Ah, I'm not really into seafood.
 Yeah, Italian food is alright. What's your favorite dish?
 Yeah, I've tried it. It's pretty good. So, did you hear about the new gym that opened downtown?
 Well, I'm not completely sure. I haven't been there yet.
 I haven't had a chance to watch a movie for a while. The last movie I saw was kind of boring.
 It was some romantic comedy. I can't even remember the name. It was that forgettable.
 It was pretty uneventful.
 No, I haven't.
 Not really my thing.
 Actually, I just saw a really good one.
 Yeah, it was amazing.
 Not really, no.
 I love concerts!
 Not really, I haven't gone to any in a while.
 That sounds good to me. How about a rock concert?
 No, what's it called?
 That sounds interesting! What kind of cuisine do they serve?
 That sounds unique! I'm not a fan of spicy food though.
 No, I haven't. I'm not really a fan of Italian food.
 I like Chinese food.
 Yeah, I love Kung Pao chicken.
 No, I haven't had the chance to travel a lot.
 Not really, to be honest.
 Not really, I'm not a huge movie buff.
 I like reading books.
 Mostly non-fiction, like history books or biographies.
 I think I'll pass on talking about books, thanks. Let's discuss something else.
 Actually, I don't really like reading.
 Not really, I don't find movies that interesting.
 Sometimes, but not really. I don't have that much time to watch TV.
 No, sports aren't really my thing either.
 Not really. I'm not that interested in science or technology.
 Not really, I tend to stick to what I know I like.
 I like to spend time outdoors, hiking and camping.
 Actually yeah, I went on a really nice hike last week.
 I hiked to the top of a nearby mountain. It was a really tough climb but the view from the top was incredible.
 Yeah, I like basketball.
 Yeah, it's fun to watch the pros play.
 Not really, I find it boring.
 Yeah, I play video games from time to time.
 Right now, I'm really into Fortnite.
 Yeah, it's not for everyone. So, what do you do for fun?
 Hmm, I don't really have any hobbies at the moment.
 Yes, I'm reading "Dune" by Frank Herbert.
 It's a science fiction novel about a desert planet called Arrakis.
 Honestly, I rarely have time to read for fun.
 Mostly just Netflix and chill.
 Yeah, I watched the first season but didn't really get into it.
 Not really, I find most new movies are pretty predictable.
 Nope, haven't heard of it. Is it any good?
 No, I'm not really into sci-fi to be honest.
 I'm a big fan of metal music! Do you listen to that?
 Yeah, I know him. But I don't really like his music.
 Well, I enjoy playing video games and reading books.
 I really like RPGs, so I'd say Final Fantasy VII is probably my favorite.
 Not really, I'm a bit of a homebody to be honest.
 No, I haven't. But I'd love to go one day.
 Not really, I'm a bit picky with my food to be honest.
 No, I haven't. But I don't really like spicy things.
 Yeah, it was nice talking with you too!
 No, I didn't. Who won?
 I'm not really into baseball. Do you watch basketball?
 Oh, I'm a Warriors fan. We should watch a game together sometime.
 How about next weekend? I'll message you the details. Anyway, have you tried this new burger place that just opened up?
 It's amazing. You have to try it. They make the burgers fresh every day using locally sourced beef.
 Yeah, that's a good idea. Oh, by the way, did you hear about that new tax law?
 Sure, no problem. Anyway, I gotta run. Talk to you soon.
 Pretty good.
 No, I haven't.
 Sure, that would be nice.
 Sorry, I can't. I have to work overtime.
 I'm an accountant.
 It's not really, to be honest. It's pretty dull.
 Yeah, I like playing video games in my free time.
 Mainly strategy games like Civilization, or role-playing games like The Witcher.
 Yeah, I'm not really into those.
 Not really, no.
 Not really, sorry.
 Sure, I love dogs.
 I don't have a dog, unfortunately. I just like them.
 Thanks, you too.
 Yeah, I did. It was amazing.
 He's pretty good. I think he's going to be a valuable addition to the team.
 Ugh, I'm so tired of all the COVID-19 related rules in sports.
 Let's talk about something else. Do you like to cook?
 Same here. What's your favorite restaurant?
 I'm not really into Italian food, sorry. We could talk about something else?
 No, not really. I don't have much time or money for travel these days.
 Not really. Honestly, I don't watch a lot of movies.
 No, it's okay. I have to go anyway. Talk to you later.
 Not really, the world seems pretty chaotic right now.
 Sorry, politics isn't really my thing.
 Honestly, I'm not really into sports either.
 Oh, I do love comedies. Especially ones with Will Ferrell.
 No, I haven't had the chance to check it out yet.
 I mostly just listen to whatever's on the radio.
 Not really, with everything going on in the world. Most of my travel plans got canceled.
 Actually, I've been reading a lot of mystery novels recently.
 Hmm, I really enjoyed "The Girl on the Train" by Paula Hawkins.
 You too! Bye.
 Not really, I haven't been in the mood.
 Yeah, I've been binge-watching Friends.
 Actually, I was thinking about checking out the new season of Stranger Things.
 I like the suspense and the nostalgia factor. What kind of show do you like?
 The Office is funny, but The Crown seems so boring.
 Not really, I try to avoid the news. It's just so depressing.
 Yeah, I know about it, but I don't really want to talk about it. It's just too depressing.
 Sorry, I don't really like cooking.
 No, I haven't.
 Alright, I'll check it out.
 Ugh, taxes, boring.
 Sure, but let's talk about something else, please.
 Jazz is not my thing, sorry.
 It's been alright. I had a lot of work to do.
 Just some boring paperwork, nothing interesting, really.
 Nothing much. Just binge-watched a TV show.
 Stranger Things. Have you watched it?
 I liked it, but the last season was kinda boring.
 I like documentaries. Have you watched any good ones lately?
 Oh, that's too bad. Do you like sports?
 Oh, that's too bad. I like to play soccer, it's a lot of fun.
 Actually, no. I try to avoid it whenever I can.
 Not really, I just listen to whatever is on the radio.
 Not really, I haven't traveled in a while.
 Yeah, I just finished "Breaking Bad". It was amazing.
 I particularly loved the character development of Walter White.
 Sorry, but I'm not such a fan of that kind of movies.
 I'm really into psychological thrillers, the kind of movies that mess with your head.
 "Memento" is a classic thriller that you might like.
 I enjoy hiking and exploring the outdoors.
 As much as I can, but probably only once or twice a month.
 Yeah, I noticed! Which movie are you excited to see next?
 Same here, I'm not looking forward to anything in particular right now.
 For sure. Anyway, I need to go get some work done. See you later.
 No, I'm not much into sports.
 Not really, I usually cook my own meals.
 Anything vegetarian.
 Not really, I prefer mild flavors.
 Uh, I don't think that's a very interesting topic.
 Yes, I love to explore new places.
 I really enjoyed my trip to Japan.
 Not really, because of the pandemic.
 Sure, bye!
 Yeah, I went to a new Italian restaurant in the city center the other day. The food was amazing.
 They do! Their homemade pasta is to die for.
 Not really interested in true crime, sorry.
 To be honest, I'm not really into technology that much.
 Actually, I'm not that big of a fan.
 I try to avoid talking about politics as much as possible.
 Well, I enjoy hiking and spending time outdoors.
 Oh, not much. Just stayed home and binged on a new Netflix series.
 Tiger King. Have you seen it?
 Me too. Anyway, what about you? Did you watch anything good recently?
 Uh, that sounds super boring. Sorry, I'm not interested in this topic.
 You know, I don't really eat pizza. This is not an interesting topic for me.
 Actually, I'm trying to stay away from politics right now. Sorry, but I'm not interested in this topic either.
 Yes, I've been to France and Italy before. How about you?
 No, I haven't. But I've heard it's a really interesting country. Maybe we can plan a trip together someday.
 It was good! I spent most of it playing video games.
 I was playing Call of Duty.
 Yeah, I just finished the whole season. It's amazing.
 No, I didn't. What kind of food is it?
 Oh, I'm not really a fan of Chinese food.
 Nothing much, just planning to clean my apartment and do some grocery shopping.
 Yes, I have been there a couple of times.
 It is a lovely city, but it can be a bit overwhelming with all the people and traffic.
 No, I haven't.
 Oh, that's great. Sorry to stop you there, but I have to go now. Have a nice day.
 No, I haven't. Is it any good?
 I might have to check it out sometime. By the way, did you catch the basketball game last night?
 Pretty boring game, to be honest. I don't know why I keep watching them.
 No, not really. I've been too busy with work to read anything recently.
 I'm into action movies, mostly. But I can't stand rom-coms.
 No, I haven't. But I'd love to go someday.
 Probably Japan. I've always been fascinated with the culture there.
 Yeah, same to you. Have a good one.
 It was alright.
 Not much, just Netflix and chill.
 Just some rom-coms. You know, the usual.
 Not really, haven't had much time for movies.
 Mostly just read or hang out with friends.
 Mostly thrillers and mysteries.
 Not at all, sorry.
 Not much, just the usual workload.
 No, too busy with work right now.
 They're all good, thanks for asking.
 Not really. Probably just gonna catch up on some sleep.
 Yes, I went to Japan last year.
 I mostly visited temples and ate tons of sushi.
 Actually, I'm allergic to seafood.
 Not recently, I usually just cook at home.
 Yeah, I like to experiment with new recipes.
 Honestly, I'm not really sure. I like trying new things all the time.
 Not really, I don't have much time for TV.
 I'm not really interested in technology, sorry.
 Yeah, I love reading! I just finished this amazing novel called Shadow of the Wind.
 You too, take care.
 Yeah, I went to this great Italian place last week.
 I had the lasagna and it was really good.
 Honestly, I'm not much of a cook myself.
 Not really, no.
 Honestly, I don't really have a favorite genre or anything.
 I enjoy reading and watching movies.
 Honestly, I don't have a favorite.
 Not really, sorry.
 You too!
 Not really, I find it pretty depressing.
 Ugh, I am so sick of that.
 I suppose. But I miss having separation between my work and home life.
 Nope, I hate it.
 Yes, and I found it incredibly boring.
 Not really. I find most movies pretty predictable.
 Not really. Everything just feels so formulaic nowadays.
 No, unfortunately. I feel like I never have enough time or money to go anywhere exciting.
 Honestly, I don't really care much about travel. I'd rather just stay home.
 No, I haven't. How is it?
 That sounds really good. What's your favorite sushi roll there?
 Hm, I'm not really a sushi person, but I do love ramen. Any good ramen places around here?
 Yeah, I can see that. I can never get tired of burgers though. Do you have a favorite burger spot in town?
 That's understandable. I should probably do the same, but I can't resist a good burger. What about pizza? Do you like pizza?
 No, I haven't really been to the gym in a while. I should probably start going though.
 No, I did not.
 Oh, I am not a big fan of Korean food.
 Hmm, I am not much of a hiker.
 No, I am not into reading.
 Yeah, I like movies. Which ones do you like?
 Oh, that movie is so violent. I don't like it.
 Not really. I prefer staying home.
 Not really. I am more of a couch potato.
 It's been pretty boring, to be honest.
 Sure, it was nice talking to you.
 No, what movie is it?
 Hmm, I'm not really into action movies.
 Mostly dramas and romantic comedies.
 Not really. I don't have much time to read.
 No, I'm not really into sports either. I prefer doing physical activities instead of watching them.
 No, I haven't traveled much lately. I've been busy with work.
 Not really interested, sorry. I'm actually running late for a meeting now. Talk to you later!
 It's going well.
 Not really, I might just stay at home and relax.
 Actually, I haven't been watching that much TV lately.
 I don't really have a preference for any particular genre.
 Not really, it's not really my thing.
 I don't really have that much free time for hobbies, unfortunately.
 You too.
 It was good, just a lot of house chores.
 Yes, I watched the latest season of The Crown. It's pretty interesting.
 Definitely. It's not for everyone though. Do you like shows about the monarchy?
 Ugh, no thank you. I get enough of that in real life.
 Actually, I'm not a big reader. I'm more of a podcast person.
 I like true crime, political analysis, and technology news.
 Definitely true crime. I'm kind of obsessed with it.
 Oh god, let's not talk about that. It's just too depressing.
 Sure, that sounds fun. Where is it located?
 Oh, awesome. I love sushi. Let's definitely check it out.
 I'm good, thanks.
 No, I haven't.
 I'm allergic to seafood.
 I enjoy Italian food, how about you?
 Yeah, I've tried a few. Honestly, they all taste the same to me.
 That sounds interesting. But I'm not really a foodie, to be honest.
 Not really. I prefer binge-watching shows on Netflix.
 I really like The Office. Have you seen it?
 Ugh, I hate Friends. It's so overrated.
 No, I haven't. What kind of food do they serve?
 Oh, I love sushi! I'll have to check it out sometime.
 Not really. I haven't had much time to watch anything.
 I'm not really into sci-fi, but thanks for the suggestion.
 Unfortunately not. I don't have much free time, and travel is expensive.
 Oh wow, that does sound incredible. Maybe someday when I have more time and money.
 No, I haven't. It seems kind of boring to me.
 Hmm, maybe I'll give it a try sometime.
 Yeah, same to you. Talk to you later.
 Actually, no.
 I can see why you'd like that, but it's not really my scene.
 Not really.
 I did watch a thriller last week, but I can't remember the name. Probably wouldn't recommend it anyway.
 I do enjoy the beach, but I haven't gone in a while.
 Yeah, I see what you mean. Can we talk about something else though?
 I don't have any pets right now, but I used to have a hamster when I was a kid.
 Really? I'm not really a fan of snakes.
 I do love Italian food.
 I haven't actually, but I'd be willing to try.
 Yes, I have!
 I love going to Central Park, seeing a show on Broadway, and visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
 Really? What did you do there?
 Hmm, that sounds pretty boring.
 Oh, cool. I work in finance.
 Risk management, mostly. It's not the most exciting work, but it pays the bills.
 Not really, I'm not much of a reader.
 Mostly just watch TV or play video games.
 No, I haven't.
 Actually, I'm not a big fan of sushi.
 Italian food is okay, I guess.
 I really like pasta carbonara.
 Pizza is good, but it's pretty basic. Do you like trying new things?
 Me too! Have you ever had Ethiopian food?
 It's really flavorful and spicy. You eat with your hands and use a type of flatbread called injera. It's definitely worth trying if you get the chance.
 No, I haven't.
 Oh, I've heard of them.
 Sorry, not interested.
 Sure, what's playing?
 Not interested in that genre.
 Oh, I've already seen it.
 Sounds like a plan.
 I love hiking and camping.
 That's alright. Everyone has their preferences.
 Hmm, fishing isn't really my thing.
 Ugh, don't remind me. It's been a really long day.
 No, I try to stay away from the news. It's too depressing.
 Sounds good.

 Not really interested in space news. Can we change the topic?
 I'm all ears. I've always wanted to visit Japan. How about you?

 Not really. I'm not much of a TV person.
 Hmm, maybe. I'll keep it in mind. Hey, I actually have to run now. Nice chatting with you!

 I really enjoy hiking and painting.
 Definitely! I would suggest starting with acrylic paint and watching some Bob Ross videos to get started.
 Actually, I just watched a really boring documentary about fungi.
 Not really, I mostly just stick to road trips around my state.
 Honestly, I'm not really sure. I haven't traveled much outside of my state.
 Sort of, but I don't really have a lot of time for it these days.
 Oh, that's a good idea. But honestly, I usually just end up getting takeout.
 Not really, what kind of food do they serve?
 I'm not a fan of Italian food, sorry.
 I'm not really into sports.
 I love music, but I don't play any instruments.
 I enjoy hip-hop and R&B.
 Actually, I don't really have a favorite. I just like what I like.
 No, I'm allergic to cats and dogs.
 That's nice. Do you have any other topics to discuss, or do we just say goodbye? I'm running a bot programming today.
 Not really, I don't watch a lot of movies.
 Actually, yeah, I just finished The Queen's Gambit. Have you seen it?
 Well, I really like The Crown. Have you watched it?
 It's a historical drama about the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
 Not really, I'm not much of a reader.
 Sorry, I haven't had the chance to watch any of them.
 Sorry, I don't watch much TV either.
 I usually just hang out with friends or play video games.
 Yeah, I'm really into first-person shooter games like Call of Duty.
 No, I haven't. They seem too boring to me.
 No, unfortunately. I've been stuck here with work.
 Ugh, don't even get me started. He's been micromanaging everything lately.
 Nope, I don't really care much for sports.
 Actually, I don't have a dog.
 No, I haven't.
 I'm not really a big fan of sushi.
 I'm really into Italian cuisine.
 Yeah, I love lasagna.
 No, I haven't had the chance to travel much lately.
 I'm not really a big movie person.
 Not really. I usually just like to read or listen to music.
 Mostly classical music. I find it very relaxing.
 No, not really. I find most other music to be too loud or too boring. Sorry, but I really have to go now. Have a good day.
 No, I'm not really into that kind of thing anymore.
 Actually, yes. I saw a really great documentary on Netflix about climate change.
 I think the filmmakers were called Chasing Ice.
 It was great. I went hiking with some friends.
 We went to Mount Rainier National Park.
 Yes, it is stunning. Have you hiked before?
 What's your favorite hiking spot?
 Nice, I've never been there. Speaking of travel, have you been to any other countries?
 Wow, that's so cool. I've never left the country.
 Yeah, I don't really have the money for that right now. Speaking of money, do you own any stocks?
 Yeah, it can be confusing. But it's important to invest in your future. Speaking of investing, do you have a 401k plan?
 I can see that. Want to talk about something else? Maybe food?
 I also like Mexican food, but I think I prefer Italian. Have you ever been to Italy?
 It's so good. Speaking of food, do you like sushi?
 Wow, I didn't know that. But that's cool. I respect people's dietary choices. Speaking of choices, what's your favorite TV show?
 Yeah, that's a great show. But have you seen Breaking Bad? It's my favorite TV show.
 You definitely should. Alright, it was nice chatting with you, but I have to go now. Talk to you later!
 No, I haven't started watching it yet.
 Yeah, I'm not really into TV shows anyways.
 No, I'm not really into video games either.
 Mostly just read books or listen to music. Speaking of which, have you checked out any new albums recently?
 Never heard of them, sorry.
 Actually, yes! I just saw a new indie film that I really enjoyed.
 It's called "The Farewell". You should check it out sometime.
 Yeah, that's cool. To be honest, I think I'm going to head out now. Nice talking with you though!
 No, I haven't.
 Hmm, I'm not a huge fan of Italian.
 Actually, I don't watch TV much.
 I like to read books.
 It was "The Catcher in the Rye" by J.D. Salinger.
 It was good. I went to a beach party with some of my friends.
 Oh no, I hope you feel better soon.
 No, I haven't. What kind of food do they serve there?
 That sounds nice. I don't eat Italian food often but it sounds like it's worth trying.
 Honestly, I can never decide. I love trying different types of food.
 I'm not a big fan, to be honest. The flavors are too intense for me.
 Oh, I love sushi. It's one of my favorites.
 Haha, yeah, it can get a bit expensive if you eat it too often.
 Speaking of burgers, have you tried the new chicken sandwich that everyone's talking about?
 apparently, it's supposed to be really good. People are comparing it to Chick-Fil-A's sandwich.
 Yeah, I hear you. Fast food is not the healthiest option out there.
 Alright, take care.
 It was great! I went camping with some friends.
 Yeah, I try to go a few times each summer.
 Yeah, I went to Hawaii a few years ago.
 Mostly just laid on the beach and went surfing.
 It can be at first, but once you get the hang of it it's a lot of fun.
 Not really, I haven't been to the movies in a while.
 I'm not really into music, to be honest.
 You too!
 No, I haven't. Is there anything particularly interesting happening?
 Oh really? I don't really care that much about it, to be honest.
 Not really, I tend to cook at home most of the time.
 Not really, I'm not much of a sports person.
 Not really, I haven't found anything that interesting lately.
 No, I'm not really into reading either.
 Not really, I haven't traveled much lately.
 No, I haven’t heard of it. Is it any good?
 I don’t think so, I’m a bit busy this weekend.
 Yeah, I’m planning to watch some movies and relax at home.
 Yeah, one of my favorite movies is The Shawshank Redemption. Have you watched it?
 Yeah, I’m really into this show called The Expanse. It’s a sci-fi show, have you heard of it?
 Yeah, I’ve watched it. I used to love it, but I got pretty tired of it after a while.
 Not really. I don’t watch that many comedy shows.
 Not really. I used to play video games a lot, but I kind of lost interest in them.
 No, not really. I mean, I’ll watch the occasional game, but I don’t really follow any sports teams or anything.
 Sure, no problem. It was nice talking to you too! See you later.
 No, I haven't been there in ages.
 That sounds interesting, but I don't know much about the art world.
 Hmm, maybe I'll check it out with some friends this weekend.
 Ugh, I can't stand that show. Too dark and depressing.
 I don't think it's worth watching if it just makes me feel depressed. Speaking of which, did you hear about the increase in gas prices?
 Not really interested in that kind of thing. I'm not a science person.
 No way, I'm way too scared for that.
 Not really, I'm trying to save up some money right now so I can't really afford to go anywhere.
 Hm, maybe. Alright, I gotta go now. Talk to you later!
 No, I can't travel now due to the pandemic.
 Not really, I haven't seen anything new that's worth watching.
 I've been playing games on my phone a lot.
 Yeah, I've been obsessed with this puzzle game called "Room".
 Not really, I don't have the attention span for it anymore.
 I don't know, I just lose interest after a few pages.
 No, I try to cook at home as much as possible.
 Nothing too exciting, just the usual stuff – pasta, stir-fry, that kind of thing.
 Yeah, you too.
 No, I haven't. What's it called?
 Hmm...I'm not really into that. But what's your favorite cuisine?
 Oh, that's cool. But have you heard about the new tax policies that the government has implemented?
 No, I haven't yet. I'll catch up on that soon. By the way, what do you think about cryptocurrencies?
 No, unfortunately not. I've been pretty busy at work lately. But what's your favorite music genre?
 Not really. I prefer to watch movies or read books. Speaking of books, do you have any recommendations for a good novel to read?
 I'm doing pretty well, thank you!
 Yes, I watched a great science fiction movie last night.
 It was called Ex Machina. Have you seen it?
 Not particularly, no.
 No, not really. I'm not much of a traveler.
 I enjoy playing video games and reading. How about you?
 Mostly RPGs and strategy games. My favorite is probably Civilization VI.
 It's pretty cloudy and looks like it's gonna rain.
 Nope, I'm not much of an animal person.
 You too!
 Yeah, I just started watching Stranger Things.
 Yeah, I love Eleven. She's so badass.
 Not really, I find them too scary.
 Yeah, I love comedies! They always make me laugh.
 Yeah, The Hangover is hilarious. But I actually think its sequels are not that good.
 No, I haven't. But I've always wanted to go there. What about you?
 Hmm, yeah, I can see that. Anyway, speaking of travel, have you ever been to Paris?
 Oh, I see. Well, thanks for sharing your opinion. Anyway, I have to go now. See you later!
 Ugh, it was so boring. I just stayed at home all day.
 No, I couldn't think of anything to do. Maybe you can give me some ideas?
 No, I didn't want to go outside.
 Hmm, I don't really like cooking, and I'm not really into museums. So I think I'll just stick to being bored at home next weekend.
 I actually haven't had time to watch any movies recently.
 I don't really like indie movies. I prefer big blockbuster stuff.
 Not really. I find it kind of boring.
 No, not really. I'm not really athletic at all.
 Don't even get me started. It's been terrible lately.
 Nope, no vacation plans. I can't afford to travel right now.
 No, I haven't heard anything about it.
 Hmm, I don't know much about Italian food.
 Not really. It seems like there haven't been any good movies out lately.
 Yeah, it's tough to find something new to watch.
 Actually, yes! I just finished a really interesting biography about Abraham Lincoln.
 Not particularly. It can be interesting, but it's not my favorite subject.
 Honestly, no. I'm not really a sports person.
 No, I'm quite busy with my job these days.
 No, I haven't been paying attention to what's happening in town lately.
 Actually, I haven't been doing much of knitting lately. I'm more into gardening now.
 Well, it all depends on what you want to grow. Are you interested in herbs, vegetables or flowers?
 That's interesting. I'm more focused on growing vegetables right now. I find it very fulfilling to grow my own food.
 Well, it certainly takes some effort, but you can make it as simple or as complex as you want.
 Sure, anytime. By the way, have you seen the news about the economic crisis? It's pretty depressing.
 You're right. Let's talk about something else. Have you been to any concerts lately?
 I don't really listen to classical music. I'm more into electronic music, like techno and trance.
 Sure, let me send you a playlist on Spotify. You might like it.
 Yeah, I did.
 Eh, I'm not really interested in it.
 Electric cars? Meh, not my thing.
 Sorry, I've been there before and didn't like it much.
 Not really. I'm kind of in a rut, to be honest.
 Nope, unfortunately not. I can't really afford to travel right now.
 Not really. I used to, but now it just doesn't seem that interesting to me.
 Actually, I saw a really great one the other day!
 Nope, I haven't had sushi in ages.
 Maybe. I'm a bit picky with my food. What's the best dish there?
 I'm not a big fan of raw fish, though. What else do they have?
 Alright, I'll think about it. Anyway, have you heard about the new iPhone 13?
 Yeah, it's supposed to have some really cool new features. I can't wait to get my hands on it.
 Sorry, never heard of them.
 Just hang out at home, really. Maybe watch some TV.
 Nope, not really interested in nature.
 Yeah, maybe. But I think I have to go now. Nice talking to you.
 Yeah, I just finished watching Stranger Things.
 Not really, they're too scary for me.
 I do like comedies. The Hangover is one of my favorites.

 Yeah, I've been really into Stranger Things on Netflix.
 Not really, no. I haven't been to the cinema in months.

 I hate traveling. It's expensive, inconvenient, and usually not worth the trouble.
 No, I didn't. Is it good?
 Oh, I love Italian food. What's your favorite dish?
 That sounds delicious. Have you been to any other good restaurants lately?
 Honestly, smoothies don't really interest me.

 I like action movies, but not really a fan of romantic comedies or drama.
 No, I can't really travel right now because of work.
 I work in accounting. It's not the most exciting job, but it pays the bills.
 Exactly. But I'm just happy to have a stable job these days.
 I haven't been there yet.
 I'll have to take your word for it. I'm not a big fan of hanging out at bars.
 I'm really into hiking and exploring new trails. How about you?
 Nice. Where do you usually go?
 That sounds cool, but I'm not really a fan of driving to far-flung hiking trails.
 Yeah, I've been to a few of them. I really like the one by the river.
 Honestly, I haven't been following them at all.
 Not really, I'm not that into sports. What about you?
 Eh, I'm not really into basketball.
 I've been re-watching Seinfeld lately. It's a classic.

 Yeah, it's on Amazon Prime.
 Not really, to be honest.
 Nope, not really into sports either. Sorry.
 Will do. Thanks, you too.
 No, I haven't. Is it any good?
 Sorry, not really interested. I'm trying to eat healthier these days.
 Not much. Just trying to stay active. How about you?
 That's cool. Lately, I've been trying out yoga. It's supposed to be good for relaxation.
 Yeah, start with simple poses and stretch properly beforehand. Also, make sure to breathe deeply.

 Not great, I've had a really long day at work.
 I'm a statistician, it can be really dull sometimes.
 Not really, I have to do boring errands like grocery shopping and laundry.

 Not really, I don't have much time or money to travel.
 Honestly, I'm not really into music.
 Not really, most of them were boring.

 Not really, no. Just work, eat, and sleep. It's been pretty dull.
 Not really. I've been thinking about maybe trying to learn a new language or something, but I haven't had the time or energy to pursue it yet.
 I don't know, maybe Spanish or something. It seems like a useful language to know.
 No, I haven't. I've been meaning to take a trip there one of these days, though.
 Maybe I will one of these days. But for now, I should probably get going. Thanks for chatting, though.
 I am not really into sports actually.

 No, I haven't had the chance yet.
 Yeah, I definitely want to go somewhere eventually. But I just don't have the time or money right now.
 No, I'm not really a pet person.
 Yeah, dogs are okay I guess. But I just don't want the responsibility of taking care of another living thing.

 That sounds scary to me. I prefer calmer activities.
 I like to read books and watch documentaries.
 There's a great one on the history of philosophy I watched recently - very interesting.

 Tame Impala is great! I'd definitely like to catch their set.
 Not really. I like music, but I usually just listen to whatever's on the radio.

 Nope, I've always been more of a cat person.
 I'm not really all that into music, to be honest.

 Definitely! Have you heard of The Jinx on HBO?
 It's a true crime series about Robert Durst, a wealthy real estate heir who was suspected of committing multiple murders.
 I work in insurance sales. It's not the most exciting thing in the world, but it pays the bills.
 Not really, unfortunately. I've always wanted to visit Europe, but I just haven't had the time or money to make it happen.
 I am fine, thanks for asking.
 No, I haven't heard about it yet.
 That sounds good. I love trying new coffee shops.
 Actually, I haven't. I've been so busy with work that I haven't had much time to read.
 I'm an accountant. It can be pretty dull sometimes.
 Well, I like watching TV, playing video games, and listening to music. How about you?

 No, I haven't. I'm not really into live music.
 Not really. It rained all weekend, so I couldn't go out.
 Yes, I love to travel.

 We spent most of our time on the beach, but we also did some hiking in rainforests and went to see some volcanoes.
 Not really. I'm not very good at it.
 Yeah, it's just not my thing. By the way, did you see the new show on Netflix?

 Really? What did you think?
 Yeah, I totally agree. I think it's one of the best shows I've seen in a long time.
 Oh, I'm not really interested in hearing about natural disasters.
 I'm really into horror movies.
 Yeah, I saw one called "Hereditary". It was really creepy.
 Actually, I'm not really into comedies. They just don't do it for me.

 It's about a high school chemistry teacher who starts making and selling methamphetamine to support his family after he's diagnosed with cancer.
 I have, but I don't really like talking about it.

 It was pretty boring to be honest. I didn't do much.
 Not really, I think I prefer just staying at home and relaxing. Thanks for the suggestion though.
 Not great. My boss yelled at me for no reason.
 Sure, let's talk about movies. What's your favorite movie?
 I really like The Godfather.
 Not really, I don't have the time.
 I like classical music.

 You too!
 Not much, just working from home.
 I know right. Have you tried any new recipes during the quarantine?
 I made some banana bread but besides that, I haven't really cooked much.
 No, I haven't. What's it about?
 Oh, I watched that. The first season was good, but I stopped watching after that.
 No, not really. The news is always so depressing.
 I like pop music. Who's your favorite artist?
 That's cool. Honestly, I'm not really into rock music.
 Yeah, it was nice talking to you too. Have a good day.
 No, I haven't.
 I think I'll pass.
 I like crime dramas, especially ones with a lot of suspense.
 Yes, both of them actually. They're great shows.

 Yes, I have. It's alright, but it's not my favorite.
 I'm not really a sports person.

 No, I haven't had time to go yet.
 Alright, maybe I will.
 I'm really into indie rock.
 I've been really into Vampire Weekend lately.
 Yeah, you should check out their album "Modern Vampires of the City". It's their best one in my opinion.
 Yes, I have. It's a great city with so much to see and do.
 Well, the Empire State Building and Statue of Liberty are must-sees. But honestly, there are so many amazing spots in that city—I could go on and on.
 Honestly, I try not to pay attention to all the diet fads out there.
 Exactly. So, what are your plans this weekend?
 Sounds like fun! Which movie do you want to see?
 Ah, I'm not really into rom-coms. That's okay though, you enjoy it!
 Pretty good.
 No, I haven't.

 Hmm, maybe. I'm not really into sci-fi though.
 Yeah, I like watching sitcoms. They're usually pretty funny.
 Friends, definitely. That show never gets old.
 Really? I think it's pretty funny. Not everything needs to be new and groundbreaking to be enjoyable.
 Never heard of it. Is it any good?
 Ugh, that sounds terrible. I hate period dramas. I can't stand all the corsets and powdered wigs.
 Well, I like playing video games. That's where I get my sci-fi fix.
 Mostly RPGs and strategy games. But I'm open to trying new things.
 No, I haven't. Sorry, I'm not really in the mood to talk about games right now.
 Not really. I just listen to whatever's popular on the radio. Tbh, I'm not that into music.

 Oh, no, I haven't. I'm really not interested in that.
 Not really, I’ve been too busy with work.
 I’m a software developer.
 Yes, it’s pretty good.

 You too!
 No, not really.
 Not really, I find it boring.
 Yeah, I actually watched a really good movie last night called The Shape of Water.

 Eh, it was alright. I felt like it was a bit predictable and didn't really deviate from the typical "monster romance" plotline.
 Not much, just been trying to stay busy with work and stuff.
 I'm a data analyst.
 It's basically just analyzing data to try to make business decisions or understand trends better.
 Yeah, it definitely can be. But it pays the bills.
 Sure, no problem. Talk to you later.

 Not really, I don't mind it too much.
 No, I've been pretty busy with work and other things.
 Yeah, no problem, catch you later!

 Yeah, I watched Stranger Things.
 I enjoyed both, but the first one was definitely better.
 I like science-fiction and fantasy.
 Yeah, I just finished reading Dune for the first time. It's a classic.

 You should try reading "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo".
 It was pretty boring. I didn't really do anything.
 Not really. I find it exhausting.
 I enjoy going to art museums.

 No, I haven't. What kind of cuisine do they serve?
 Sorry, I have other plans for tonight. Maybe some other day.
 A little bit, why?
 Sorry, I don't really follow politics. It's just too much for me.
 I love playing video games in my free time. How about you? What do you enjoy doing?
 Oh, that's cool. I used to read a lot when I was younger, but I haven't had much time for it recently.
 Not really. I haven't gone anywhere outside of the city in a while.
 That does sound amazing. Maybe one day I'll be able to visit a place like that. But for now, I need to go. It was good talking to you!
 It was pretty uneventful, just stayed home and binge-watched some TV shows.
 Just some old sitcoms, like Friends and Seinfeld.
 I've heard about it, but I haven't watched it yet.
 To be honest, not really. I don't have the patience for it.
 I enjoy action movies with lots of explosions and car chases.
 Not really. I find them kind of boring.
 Not really, I'm kind of a workaholic.
 It's okay, I guess. It pays the bills.
 Not recently, but I went to France last year.
 Yes, I did. The Eiffel Tower is amazing.
 Well, it depends on what you're interested in. What are you hoping to see?
 Sorry, but that sounds pretty boring to me. I prefer going to beaches and enjoying a relaxing time. I'm not too interested in museums and historic places.
 I enjoy playing golf, reading, and watching TV shows. What about you?
 Yeah, I saw "Joker" and thought it was great.
 You definitely should, it's intense. Do you like dramas in general?
 Oh, that's fair. What's your favorite comedy movie?
 Oh yeah, that's a classic. What about TV shows, do you watch any good ones?
 Hmm, I've heard mixed reviews about that one. Honestly, I don't really care for historical dramas.
 Not really. I guess I enjoy watching basketball occasionally, but I wouldn't say I'm a big fan of any team or anything.
 Oh, cool. So did you follow the World Cup at all this year?
 Oh, got it. Well, what else do you like to do for fun?
 Honestly, I don't really have many hobbies outside of work. I mostly just like to relax and watch TV.
 No, not really. I was pretty much just catching up on work.
 No, I haven't.
 Oh, that's terrible.
 No, I haven't.
 Ugh, COVID news again. Can we talk about something else?
 Actually, I'm not really a sports person.
 Yeah, I've been reading a lot of mystery novels lately.
 Non-fiction? To be honest, I find it pretty boring.
 Actually, I'm not really into movies either. Sorry.
 It's been pretty stressful, with all the deadlines and stuff. I don't really want to talk about it.
 Oh, that's great news! I'm really happy for them.
 Hmm, actually, I don't really care much for weddings.
 Not really, just planning to relax at home. How about you?
 Yeah, that sounds nice. Hey, I gotta go now. Talk to you later!
 Yes, I have been reading some motivational books.
 I really like Simon Sinek. His book, "Start With Why," is really inspiring.
 Not really, I'm not into romantic books.
 Yes, I love documentaries. Particularly ones about nature and animals.

 Not really, I'm not that into cooking.
 No worries. Hey, I gotta go now. Let's catch up again sometime soon!
 Yes, I actually lived there for a few months back in college.
 Definitely go see a Broadway show if you can. But honestly, I found the city to be way too busy and overwhelming.
 It's definitely diverse, but I personally didn't find anything that blew me away.
 Not really. I'm actually kind of tired of all the superhero shows that seem to be dominating TV right now.
 Oh, I actually tried watching that but didn't really get into it.
 I'm not really into music, to be honest.
 Well, I guess I like classical music. But mostly just as background noise.
 No, I've never been. I don't really see the point, to be honest.
 Sorry, I don't think that's really my thing. Look, I gotta go now. Talk to you later.
 Not really. I don't have much interest in movies these days.
 I'm just kind of burnt out, I guess. Plus, it seems like every movie is either a superhero flick or a remake these days.
 Actually, yes. I just finished a memoir about a woman who survived the Holocaust. It was really eye-opening.
 If you're interested in business, I recently read "Shoe Dog" by Phil Knight. It's about how he started Nike.
 Not really. I don't have any investments and I find the whole thing kind of boring.
 No, I've been pretty stuck in my old favorites. I don't really have the energy to stay current with new artists.
 I haven't really tried it yet, but it seems pretty cool. I imagine it would be a little disorienting, though.
 Yeah, you too. Have a good day!
 No, which one are you referring to?
 Oh, I don't eat seafood.
 Have you tried the new fitness class at the gym?
 Do you have any upcoming vacations planned?

 Not really, I don't have much time for reading these days.
 No, I don't like horror movies.

 Yes, I have a younger brother who's in college right now.
 Not really, I prefer to stay home.

 Ah, I understand. It's not for everyone.
 I also like Stranger Things.
 It's about a group of kids who try to save their town from supernatural forces. It's really good.
 I saw Joker, it was quite good.
 Yeah, it's definitely not a feel-good movie.
 Not much, just work and home. It's been pretty boring, to be honest.
 Yeah, it's tough to balance everything sometimes. Speaking of work, how's your new job going?
 I'm not really a music person, but I guess I like some pop.
 Honestly, I don't really have one.
 I work in an office. It's kind of boring, to be honest.
 Huh, customer service sounds rough. Do you at least get good benefits?
 Ah, that sucks. I'm pretty lucky in that regard, I guess. My office is pretty good about that kind of thing.
 Not much, honestly. I like reading sometimes, and I go for walks when the weather's nice.
 Not really, no. I've never been much of a gamer.
 Not really, and to be honest, I don't really care to hear about it. Politics just makes me stressed out.
 I actually don't drink coffee at all.
 Yeah, tea is okay, I guess. I don't drink it that often, though.
 Yeah, I just saw The Green Knight.
 Hm, it was pretty slow-paced, but I appreciated the cinematography.

 No, I haven't.
 Hmm that sounds interesting. I love trying out new food.
 I would love to, but I'm actually trying to save money this month.
 Well, I've been really into rock music lately.
 I really like Muse. They're an alternative rock band.

 I actually like a good cup of coffee.
 Not really. I usually just brew my own coffee at home.
 No, I don't like fishing.
 Well, I enjoy playing video games and reading books.
 I like reading mystery novels.
 That would have to be "Gone Girl" by Gillian Flynn. Have you read it?
 I don't know, it depends on what you like. There are so many great places to go. I like the beach, personally.
 Yeah? Why not?
 Oh, I see. Yeah, I guess it's not for everyone.
 Hm, that sounds a bit boring to me. I'm not really into hiking.
 No way, that's way too dangerous for me.
 Nope, I'm not a fan of heights.
 Good, thanks. How about you?
 Eh, not really. I've been pretty busy with work.
 I work in accounting. It's not that exciting, but it pays the bills.
 I guess so. Do you like to exercise at all?
 Not really. I know I should, but it just feels like a chore.

 Pretty good, thanks. And you?
 Oh, that's too bad. Did something keep you up?
 Yeah, I have. I really like them, actually. You?
 I see. Hey, do you have any pets?
 Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. How about traveling? Do you like to travel?
 I get that. Hey, did you see the new documentary on Netflix about sea creatures?
 Alright. Well, I have to go to a meeting now. Nice talking to you!
 No, I haven't. What kind of food do they serve?
 Hmm, I'm not sure I'm up for something that exotic.
 I usually go for classic American fare. Burgers, fries, that sort of thing.
 Not really. I find them kind of boring.
 No way, I'm really not interested in that stuff.
 Honestly, I don't have a lot of spare time for hobbies. I work pretty much all the time.
 I'm a data analyst. It's pretty dull, to be honest.
 Same to you.

 Just work, mostly. Same old, same old.
 Unfortunately not, I don't really have the time or money for that at the moment.
 Yeah, it's tough to find the time and resources to do something like that.
 It was alright, didn't get up to much.
 My girlfriend made me watch a romantic comedy. It was terrible.

 They're doing alright. Thanks for asking.
 Yeah, it was nice to talk with you too.
 No, I’m not really into sports.
 I love reading, especially science fiction novels.

 Well, I’m an accountant. It’s not the most exciting job in the world, but it pays the bills.
 No, not really. It just kind of happened after college.
 No, I haven’t had the chance yet. But I’d love to go to Paris someday.
 No, I haven’t. But I’m not really interested in going there.

 It's a fusion restaurant so they serve a mix of different cuisines.
 No, not really. I didn't get to travel much this year due to work.
 I work in finance.
 Actually, I'm really into gardening. I've been trying to grow my own vegetables lately.

 Not really. I used to be into basketball but not so much anymore.

 I don't think I'd like uni, it doesn't seem very appetizing.

 Not really, I'm not much of a fan.
 To be honest, I don't watch a lot of movies.
 Again, not really. I'm more of a non-fiction guy.
 Mainly history and economics.

 Yes, I did.
 It was okay, I think the show has gone downhill in recent seasons.

 Really? That's interesting.
 Some of them. I like The Office and Parks and Recreation.

 I like a little bit of everything. Metallica, Kendrick Lamar, and Adele are my current favorites.

 Not much, just hanging out at home. Maybe catch up on some reading.
 No, what's so special about it?
 Hmm, I'm not a big fan of modern art.
 I like traditional paintings, like from the Renaissance period.

 I don't know, it's hard to find something fun that doesn't annoy me after a while...
 Nothing much, just watched television.
 Not really, just some documentary about the history of trains.
 Not really, I already knew most of the stuff they talked about.

 Oh, I've heard of that one. Is it good?
 Maybe I will. Hey, did you hear about the new software update for our computers at work?
 Honestly, I have no idea. I just heard the IT people talking about it.
 I did, but I don't think I'll be going. I don't really enjoy working out.

 Not really, I'm not a big concert person. I find the crowds overwhelming.
 Actually, yes! I really enjoyed the new crime thriller that came out last month. Have you seen it?
 "Criminal Minds". It's really gripping, I definitely recommend it.

 No, I haven't.
 Oh, well, I'm not vegan, but I could appreciate a good dish.
 That does sound pretty interesting.
 Not really my thing, documentaries tend to be a bit dull.
 Yeah, but I don't think I want to bum myself out with that kind of stuff.
 Not really, I'm not a music person.
 I like reading, mainly.
 Oh, all sorts, really. Recently I read this one about a detective in Victorian London, it was really good.

 Actually, that sounds interesting. What kind of non-fiction books are you talking about?
 Actually, I think I saw a documentary on that same topic not too long ago. I feel like I've got a pretty good grasp of the basics already.
 Yeah, they're okay, I guess.
 Eh, I don't really have a favorite. I don't find the whole action movie genre all that interesting.
 It was fine, went to the beach.
 Yeah, you should go sometime. Do you like swimming?
 Oh, that's cool. I have never been hiking before. Is it hard?

 I don't read much either, to be honest.
 I usually just watch TV or browse the internet.
 Not really. I prefer to just stay at home.
 Honestly, I don't really have a favorite. I just listen to whatever's playing.
 Yeah, you too.
 It was good, I went on a hike with some friends.

 Not really. I just stayed at home and watched some TV. It was pretty boring.
 Not really. Just some random sitcoms that were on. Nothing special.
 Not yet. I'm hoping to do something fun, though. Maybe go for a hike or something.

 Sure, I will. I gotta go now. Talk to you later!

 I've never been to Hawaii. What did you do there?
 That sounds nice. Do you like watching sports?
 Yeah, I'm really into football. But it's okay, we can talk about something else. Are you interested in politics?
 Yeah, I hear you. How about cooking? Do you like to cook?
 Okay, that's understandable. How about video games, do you like playing them?

 No, I haven't.

 Not really. I prefer to stay indoors.
 Yeah, sure. What's your favorite movie?

 Nope, I can't say I've tried that before.
 No, I don't think we get much surfing around here.
 Not really. The last movie I saw was kind of boring.
 Some artsy indie film that my friend dragged me to see. It was slow-paced and pretentious. Definitely not my thing.

 Actually, I did just finish a really good mystery novel.
 "The Silent Patient" by Alex Michaelides. It was really gripping!
 I'm doing fine, thanks.
 Yeah, I watched Tenet last week. It was really good.

 I enjoy documentaries and historical dramas. How about you?
 Oh, I've heard good things about "The Office". I might have to give it a try. But speaking of documentaries, have you seen "The Social Dilemma" on Netflix?

 Yeah, I love watching crime series. How about you?
 No, I haven't. I think it's too risky for me.
 No, absolutely not.
 Yes, I did. I thought it was intriguing.
 I am currently binging Friends again.
 Yes, I love romantic comedies.
 Not really, I don't enjoy feeling scared.
 No, I don't. I am not into sports at all.
 I'd rather not talk about it, if it's possible
 No, I can't handle spicy food at all.
 Yes, I have. But I am not a big fan of it.
 I am working as a software engineer.
 No, I don't have the time or the interest in video games.
 Sure, see you later.
 It was good. I went on a hike with my friends.
 Yeah, it's really refreshing. Do you like outdoor activities?
 Oh, that's cool. What kind of books do you like?
 Oh, that's interesting. Do you have any recommendations?
 That sounds good. I'll check it out later. Is there anything else you like to do in your free time?
 Oh, well that’s okay. Everyone has their own thing. Which TV show are you into right now?
 Haha, that’s a classic show. I’ve seen it many times as well. What do you think about it?
 Yeah, I can see that. It's definitely of its era. Alright, It was nice talking to you, I have to go now.
 Just running some errands.
 Not really, just planning on staying in and watching TV.
 Not particularly, just watching whatever is on.
 No, not really interested in fitness right now.
 Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of music.
 Sorry, that's not really my thing.
 Not really. I don't have much interest in traveling at the moment.
 I don't have much free time to pursue any hobbies in particular.
 That sounds good to me.
 Not really, I don't watch TV much.
 I usually hang out with friends or read books.
 Mostly non-fiction, history and politics books.
 Haha, yeah - I can see how they might not be for everyone.
 I do, I love exploring new places.
 Japan, for sure. The culture there is incredible.
 Ummm.... it's hard to say. I think I liked visiting Tokyo the most. There's just so much to see and do there.
 No, I haven't had the chance yet. But I'd definitely like to go.
 Yeah, I've heard. That's definitely on my bucket list.
 It's been alright, just busy with work.
 I work in accounting. It's not the most exciting, but it pays the bills.
 Oh, that sounds like a tough job. I don't think I could handle dealing with people all day.
 I like to read and watch TV. Nothing too exciting, really.
 Mostly non-fiction. I like to learn about history and science.
 Yeah, there are definitely some great ones. But it depends on what you're interested in, I guess.
 Not really. Just going to do some housework and maybe catch up on some shows.
 Hiking? That doesn't really sound like my thing.
 Yeah, that sounds good. Anyway, I should probably get back to work now. Talk to you later.
 Yes, I did. The Stranger Things was amazing!
 Absolutely not. They scare me a lot.
 Not really, I find them boring.
 Not really. I don't find those series appealing.
 To be honest, I'm not too picky, but I enjoy comedy series. I love How I Met Your Mother.
 No, not really. I wish I could go somewhere, but I've been busy with work lately.
 I work in accounting. It's not very exciting, but it pays the bills.
 Not really. I don't read that often.
 Actually, I don't really enjoy going out to eat.
 I've been trying to read more lately.
 Mostly non-fiction. History and science books, things like that.
 Oh, sounds neat.
 Hm, okay.

 That's cool.
 Ah, I've heard of that one. But honestly, I'm not really interested in gaming.
 Not really, no.
 Yeah, it's been a good conversation.
 Not really, I'm not really into reading.
 I've seen a few on Netflix, but nothing too exciting lately.

 Not really, I don't really enjoy sports that much.
 Honestly, I haven't been eating out too much lately. Just been cooking at home.
 Yeah, you too.
 It was okay.
 Nothing much. I went to work and did some grocery shopping after work.
 Nope, just the usual stuff.
 Actually, I'm really busy this weekend. I have to help my sister move to a new apartment.
 Not really. I'm not a big fan of movies. Haven't watched anything lately.
 Actually, yes. I've been reading a lot lately. Mostly romance novels.
 Not really, I'm still exploring the genre.
 No, I haven't. I'm not really into traveling or exploring new places.
 Actually, no. I haven't gone out to eat in a while.
 I'm not really a picky eater, but I guess I gravitate towards Asian cuisine.
 Yeah, once I tried a squid dish that wasn't cooked properly and it was pretty gross.
 No, I haven't. I've heard that it smells really bad though.
 I'm not super into movies. I prefer books, actually.
 It was a sci-fi novel called "The Three-Body Problem". Do you like science fiction?
 Hmm, not really. I haven't had a lot of time to read lately, unfortunately.
 Not really, I haven't been able to travel much due to the pandemic.
 Honestly, I haven't thought much about it. I'm just happy to stay close to home for now.
 I actually just moved to a new apartment, so I haven't had the chance to explore too much yet.
 Yeah, you too. Have a great day.
 Yeah, I went there last weekend. The pasta was amazing.
 I recommend the margherita pizza, it's also pretty good.

 Not at all. I'm not a big fan of running.
 Not really, I don't go to concerts very often.
 No, I have never gone hiking in the mountains.

 Pretty boring, just work stuff.
 Not really, just a bunch of emails to reply to.
 Yeah, I enjoy hiking and camping.
 Yeah, I love hiking in the Rocky Mountains. There are so many beautiful trails out there.
 Definitely fall. The leaves are so colorful and the weather is perfect.

 I'm doing fine, thank you.
 I'm sorry, I have a lot of work to finish during my lunch break.

 I really enjoy science fiction novels.
 Yes, I have! He's one of my favorite authors.
 Not really, just planning on relaxing at home.
 No, I haven't. Do you recommend it?
 Nice, I love salmon. So, what are your plans for the weekend?
 Oh, I don't really like hiking.
 Sounds like a plan! What do you feel like watching?
 Have you watched Bridesmaids? It's hilarious.
 Sure, but make mine non-alcoholic, please. I don't drink.
 I love iced tea! How about you?
 Sounds good. Hey, we're almost at the theater. What time does the movie start?
 Nah, I'm good. I don't like popcorn anyway.
 Maybe some nachos?
 Pretty good.
 Not really, no.
 Not really a book person, sorry.
 Yeah, I'm pretty into video games.
 Probably Skyrim.
 Not really, no.
 Not really, no. Sorry, I guess I'm kind of boring!
 Mostly just watch TV or play video games, to be honest.
 Not anything really specific, just whatever's on, y'know?
 You too.
 Which one?
 Hmm, that sounds interesting, I'll add it to my list.
 Yes, I have. But I wouldn't want to do it again.
 So, have you been watching any other good shows lately?
 Oh, I see. Well, have you tried watching The Crown?
 Ah, okay. How about movies? Do you have a favorite movie of all time?
 Oh, I see. Well, what do you like to do in your free time then?
 Nice, that sounds really relaxing. How long have you been doing yoga?
 Which one? "Stranger Things"? I enjoyed that one.
 I haven't seen that one yet.
 I will consider it. What genre are you into?
 I am more into romantic comedies. I know it might sound boring.
 Well, it's been raining all day, and I was hoping for some sunshine.
 Really? I can't stand the gloomy feeling it gives me.
 Oh, I don't like talking about politics. It's a sensitive topic.
 I love Mexican food. What about you?
 No, I haven't heard of any new place.
 Not really, I haven't had much time to read.
 Ugh, I hated that book.
 Yeah, I just couldn't get into it. So, did you see the game last night?
 The baseball game. It was a close one.
 That's too bad, it's a great sport.  So, what kind of TV shows are you into?
 Oh, I don't watch that show. I find it boring.
 No, I haven't heard about it. What type of cuisine do they offer?
 Interesting. I love Italian food. What's your favorite dish?
 I'm a big fan of lasagna.
 Ugh, I try to avoid them. Anything interesting going on?
 Actually, I have a dog. She's a beagle named Sophie.
 Yeah, I understand that. Pets require a lot of care and attention. Have you been reading any good books lately?
 Sorry, I'm not really into sci-fi. Do you have any other recommendations?
 It was not good. I missed an important call from my boss.
 Yes, I am. I really hope he doesn't get angry with me.
 Thanks for the encouragement.
 Not really, sports are not my thing.
 I actually haven't watched any movies in a while.
 Nope, not really. I don't really care much for TV.
 I really enjoy reading. Do you like to read too?
 Mostly non-fiction. I love learning new things.
 It's going alright.
 Not really. I'll probably just relax at home.
 No, I haven't.
 I'm not a big fan of sushi, to be honest.

 I like to read and listen to music.
 Not really, although vacations are something I could use right now.
 Not really my thing, I already spend too much time in my apartment.
 I'm not much of an artist, to be honest.
 Sports bore me to death, to be frank.

 To be honest, no. I barely have any time to read as it is.

 Not really, but I guess it pays the bills.
 Not really, I haven't found any place worth going to.
 Yeah, I love Italian food!

 Not great, actually.
 Not really.
 I don't really care about the weather.
 I haven't read anything lately.
 Not really, I don't watch TV that much.
 Not particularly...could we talk about something different, please?
 I love pets! I have a dog named Max.
 He's a Golden Retriever. Can I ask you a question? What's your favorite food?
 I'm not really a foodie, honestly.
 I love traveling, but I haven't gone anywhere lately because of the pandemic.
 I would love to visit Japan one day.
 Yeah, Italy is beautiful. I really enjoyed the food when I went there.
 Not great. I had a rough night, couldn't sleep at all.
 Yeah, but they don't help much.
 Not really, I haven't had time to watch anything recently.
 Oh, I've heard of it, but I'm not really into historical dramas.
 Honestly, not really. I've been feeling pretty burnt out lately.
 That's true, I could really use a break. Speaking of which, have you been on any good trips lately?
 Oh wow, I'm so jealous. I've always wanted to go there.
 Yeah, that sounds good. Let's plan on it.
 Not much, just trying to stay cool in this heat.
 Actually, I haven't really been eating out much. Trying to save some money.
 Not really, I feel like nothing good has come out lately.
 No, not really. I've just been listening to the same old stuff.
 Not really, I don't really keep up with sports.
 Yeah, sounds good. Nice talking to you.
 Oh, I haven't been there yet. But I love sushi, so I'm interested.
 Nice, I'll have to check it out. By the way, did you read the news about the stock market today?
 Oh, I don't really play games that much. I find them kind of boring.
 Eh, I prefer doing something more active. Like hiking, for example.
 It was good. I saw Hamilton on Saturday.
 Definitely! I'd highly recommend it.
 You should definitely go! Have you seen any other Broadway shows?
 Oh, well, still plenty of great plays and shows out there. What other kinds of performances do you enjoy?
 Ah, I see. What kind of books do you like to read?
 That's cool. I've been trying to read more lately. What book are you reading right now?
 Oh, wow. That sounds really interesting.
 Not really. To be honest, I haven't had much time to read recently, what with work taking up most of my day.
 No problem, take care!
 Not much, just watching TV.
 Just some crime show, it’s getting pretty boring.
 Yeah, it’s kind of annoying to sit through ads all the time.
 No, I haven’t.
 Maybe someday I’ll go, but honestly, I’d rather just stay home.
 Not really, I don't have much time to read.
 Thanks, I’ll keep that in mind.
 No, not really.
 Yeah, I like to stay active too.
 I like to lift weights, it’s a good way to stay in shape.
 Well, just start with low weights and work your way up slowly over time.
 It was okay. I spent most of it cleaning my apartment.
 Yeah, I went to a concert on Friday night. It was awesome.
 I saw The Weeknd. He's one of my favorite artists.
 I really like "Starboy". It has some great songs on it.
 Not really, no. I just don't really get into other types of music.
 It's been alright. A little stressful, but nothing too crazy.
 Not really. Probably just staying in and relaxing.
 Nah, I haven't been keeping up with that one.
 Sounds good. Talk to you soon!
 Not much, just stayed at home and binged on some Netflix shows.
 I watched Ozark and Breaking Bad.
 Hmm, have you watched Stranger Things?
 Oh, how about Chernobyl? It's not really a TV show, but it's a great one.
 It's a mini-series about the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine. It's really intense, but definitely worth watching.
 Not really, documentaries are boring.
 I like horror movies. Have you seen Midsommar?
 No, I haven't. I've been trying to cook more at home lately.
 Just some simple stuff. Sandwiches mostly.
 No, I haven't had much time for TV lately. I've been studying for work.
 I work in marketing. It's not too exciting, but it pays the bills.
 Not really. I'm on a pretty tight budget, so I can't afford to take any big trips.
 Honestly, I mostly just watch TV and read books. It's pretty boring, I know.
 No, I'm not really into comedies.
 Yeah, I'm into those.
 I don't really have one.

 Not really, I prefer podcasts instead.

 Honestly, reading isn't really my thing either.
 I actually haven't had much time to watch anything lately.
 Mostly just hanging out at home or going for a walk.

 Sorry, I gotta go. I have some work to finish. Maybe we can continue this conversation later.
 Actually, I haven't been to the movies in a while.
 Not really, I don't have much time to watch TV.
 Honestly, I don't read that much anymore.
 Sure, I've been to a few places.

 I like playing video games, hanging out with my friends, and going to concerts.
 I like action games, RPGs, and sometimes sports games.
 Yeah, I played Persona 5 recently. It was really good.
 Yeah, you too.
 Oh, it was boring. I just stayed at home and watched TV shows.
 Not really, but I recently watched a documentary about space. It was very interesting.
 I learned about the different phases of the moon and how astronauts live and work in space. It was quite informative.
 No, I haven't.
 Well, maybe someday I'll see one. But anyways, did you watch any movies recently?
 Oh no, I hate horror movies. They are so scary.
 Yeah, comedies are the best. I love to laugh.
 Yes, I did. It was hilarious.
 Yeah, I loved Alan. He was so weird and funny.
 Yeah, me too. Have a great evening.
 It was alright.
 Not really. Just the usual boring stuff at work.
 Yeah, I've been watching this crime documentary series on Netflix. It's been pretty good.
 It's called "The Innocence Files".
 Yeah, it's definitely pretty gripping. It's about people who were wrongly convicted of crimes and how they were eventually exonerated.
 Hmm, yeah, I don't really get into old movies that much.
 Honestly, I usually just veg out on the couch and watch TV.
 Yeah, I've never really been into that kind of thing.
 Yeah, I've never really struggled with stress or anxiety, so I don't think I need it.
 Yeah, I've heard exercise can be really helpful for stress. I'm not much of a runner, though.
 Yeah, I get that. I've never really been able to get into exercise as a hobby. It just feels like work to me.
 Yeah, I suppose that's true. But for me, I'm happy just being a couch potato most days.
 Nah, not really. I usually just cook at home. But I heard there's a really good burger place down the street from me that I've been meaning to check out.
 No, I haven't watched it yet.
 Maybe, but I'm not too keen on that genre.
 Actually, I've been really into biographies recently.
 I just finished reading Michelle Obama's biography, it was great.
 To be honest, I'm not really into music.
 Yeah, I love horror movies!
 Not really, I just find horror movies thrilling.
 No, I don't have any pets right now.
 Yes, it was nice talking to you too.
 I'm doing okay.
 No, I haven't.
 That sounds great. I drink coffee every day.
 I like cappuccino.
 No, I haven't.
 Maybe. So, how's the weather been lately?
 That's kind of boring. Do you have any exciting plans for the weekend?
 That sounds kind of boring too. Have you seen any good movies lately?
 I don't really like Tom Hanks movies. They're usually too predictable.
 Not really. I don't read that often.
 Yeah, I love watching Friends. I could watch it on repeat forever.
 I'm not really into movies, honestly. They all seem to be the same thing over and over again.
 I love hiking and spending time outdoors.
 Yeah, I've gone camping a few times. It's not really my thing though.
 Not really. I'm not very athletic.
 Yeah, I've been to a few countries in Europe. It was an amazing experience.

 No, I didn't. I'm not really into sports.
 Actually, I don't read much either. Sorry.
 Honestly, I don't have Netflix right now.
 I do like music, but I haven't been to a concert in ages.
 I do, but some comedians are hit-or-miss for me.
 I really like Dave Chappelle.
 No, I haven't.
 Maybe another time. Actually, I need to go because my pets are waiting at home. Sorry.
 Not too great actually, I've had a headache all day.
 Yeah, I've taken some medicine, but it doesn't seem to be helping much.
 Not really, just going to catch up on some work.
 Yeah, not ideal, but it'll be good to get some things done.
 No, I haven't.
 Sure, that sounds like a good idea.
 No, I haven't really been into mobile games lately.
 Not really, I haven't had much time to watch movies lately.
 Sure thing, thanks. Gotta run for now, though. Talk to you later.
 It's been alright, just busy with work.
 I work in accounting. It's pretty boring, honestly.
 Yeah, I'm really into gardening.
 Mostly vegetables and herbs. I try to grow as much of my own food as possible.
 Yeah, start small and make sure you're planting things that will grow well in your climate.
 I haven't really had time to watch TV lately.
 Not really. I mostly just listen to classical music.
 No, I'm allergic to most animals.
 Thanks, you too.
 I'm not doing great, had a lot of work at the office.
 I work in finance. How about you?
 Oh really? I always wanted to write a book but never got around to it.
 Yeah, I bet. What kind of books do you write?
 I'm not a big fan of those genres.
 I prefer non-fiction, especially biographies.
 I'm a big fan of Winston Churchill. What about you?
 That's interesting. I don't know much about her.
 That's impressive, I'll have to look her up. Hey listen, I have to go now.
 Not too bad.
 No, not really. I'm just going to stay at home and relax.

 Nope, don't really know much about it.
 Not really, sorry.
 No, not really interested in sports.
 No, sorry, don't really have any good travel stories to share right now.

 Oh, I've seen it so many times, I'm getting sick of it.
 Not much, honestly. I mostly just work and watch TV.
 I guess so. Maybe I'll take up gardening or something.
 Yeah, that could be fun.
 Sounds good to me.
 I'm good, thanks.
 Sorry, I'm not really into sports.
 Yes, I watched The Godfather last week. It's a classic.
 I get it. What about music, do you listen to any particular genre?
 Really? I'm not a big fan of country.
 Well, I love reading books. How about you?
 Okay. Do you like cooking?
 I like cooking, but only when I have the time for it.
 Unfortunately no, I haven't been able to travel much due to the pandemic.
 Yes, I got vaccinated as soon as I could. How about you?
 Which one? There's so many!
 Oh, I just started it. It's okay.
 Only the first one. It was pretty predictable, to be honest.
 Yeah, but most of the time you could tell what was going to happen next.
 I've been binging "The Office" for the millionth time. I just never get tired of it!
 Oh really? I guess it's not for everyone.
 I don't really watch much TV actually.
 Not really my thing either. Sorry.
 Yeah, I like some types of music.
 Mostly pop and rap.
 That's cool, too.
 Mostly reading and cooking.
 I like making my own pasta from scratch. It's super satisfying!
 It's really not that hard once you get the hang of it!
 Haha, anytime! Well, I gotta run, but it was nice chatting with you!
 No, I haven't.
 Yeah, I have. I'm not really into sci-fi though.

 Sure thing. So, do you like to read?
 Oh, okay. What kind of movies do you like?
 I see. I'm more of a drama type of person myself.
 I like to go hiking or visit museums.
 (chuckles) I beg to differ. To each his own, I guess. Speaking of hikes, have you done any good ones recently?
 Ah, I see. Well, I guess everyone has their preferences. Hey, speaking of preferences, have you found a new job yet?
 Yeah, I did. It was such a close match.

 You too! We should catch up again soon.
 No, I wasn't interested.
 Not really, but I do enjoy playing basketball though.
 Yeah! I loved the new sci-fi movie that came out recently.
 It's called "Interstellar".
 I thought it was amazing! The visuals were stunning and the storyline was so thought-provoking.
 Well, I love reading books. Lately, I've been into biographies.
 Unfortunately, not really. Most of the stuff on TV these days is pretty boring.

 Just some old classics like Mario and Sonic.
 Oh really? I'm not a big movie person.
 Probably sushi or Chinese food.
 Actually, I can't really handle spicy food.
 Not really. I'm not much of a sports person.

 Sounds like a good idea. But I think I should get going now, I have an early morning.
 It was great, I went hiking with my friends.
 We went to Mount Washington.
 It was a bit challenging, but it was worth it for the views.
 No, but I've always wanted to try.
 Oh, I've never even done that. Seems like it would be fun, though.

 Really? I've heard a lot of good things about it, but it's not really my cup of tea.
 Not really. I find most movies these days to be pretty formulaic and uninteresting.

 I prefer RPG games like The Witcher.
 Yeah, it has a great storyline and awesome graphics. It's a must-play.
 Not really. I find it very boring.
 Well, good for you. It's just not my thing. Speaking of things I don't like, do you watch sports?

 I really like sci-fi movies. Interstellar is one of my favorites.
 Of course! It's a classic.
 No, I'm not really into reading. It's not that interesting to me.
 I like to go hiking and camping or just spend time outdoors.
 Yeah, I'd be down for that. Let's plan it sometime.
 Not great, I spilled coffee all over my shirt earlier.
 Just a regular old drip coffee.

 Yeah, I get that. I thought I couldn't give up cheese either, but there are some really good vegan alternatives out there.
 Actually, I struggle with keeping up with my exercise routine.
 I know what you mean. Personally, I prefer to stay active by doing outdoor activities like hiking.
 Not really, sorry. I just moved here a few months ago, so I haven't had a chance to explore the hiking trails yet.
 Actually, I used to move around a lot when I was younger. It was tough, but it also gave me a chance to see and experience different parts of the country.
 No, I haven't. I'm not really into trying new places.
 Yeah, I'm sure it is. But for me, it's just not worth the trouble.

 No, I'm not really into that kind of thing.
 Not really, I don't have the time or money for that kind of thing right now.

 I'm alright.
 No, I haven't.
 I'm not really into reading thrillers.
 Not really. I haven't had much time to watch movies lately.

 Yes, I have a dog. She's adorable.
 Her name is Luna. She's a German Shepherd.
 You too, take care!

 I think burgers take the cake. They're just too good to resist.
 Not really. I haven't found any good ones around here.
 Really? What's it called?
 Eh, I'll pass. Burgers are great, but they're not really something I want to talk about.
 I don't know. Anything but food! Maybe we could talk about the latest technology trends?
 Honestly, I haven't been keeping up with it too much.

 Oh no, that's awful. Was anyone hurt?
 Well, that's a relief, I guess. But it's still sad to hear.

 Not much, just hung out at home. Watched some TV, read a book, that kind of thing.
 Oh cool, who did you see?
 Meh, I'm not really a fan.
 Honestly, I don't really listen to music that much. Just whatever's on the radio or whatever.
 Yeah, maybe. Anyway, I gotta run. Talk to you later!
 Which game?
 Oh, no, I didn't. I'm not really into sports.

 Actually, no. I haven't had much time for reading lately.
 Not really. I haven't traveled much lately with everything going on. Plus, I'm trying to save money.
 To be honest, I don't really eat out much. I prefer cooking at home.
 Yep, talk to you soon.
 It was okay. Just a typical day at work.
 I'm a data entry clerk. It's pretty boring, to be honest.

 Ugh, no. I'm terrible in the kitchen.

 Definitely. But I did like the de-aging effects they used on the actors.
 No, I'm not really into Star Wars.

 It's about a kid with deer antlers, and in a post-apocalyptic world where humans and hybrids like him coexist.
 Honestly, I couldn't care less.
 Not really. I guess the only sport I'm kinda into is soccer, but even then I don't really have a favorite team.
 Yeah, you too. Bye.
 Pretty boring, but it's going okay.
 I'm stuck at work and there's nothing interesting happening here.
 I work in IT, which can be pretty boring sometimes.

 It's about a high school chemistry teacher who turns to making and selling meth to provide for his family after he's diagnosed with cancer.

 Oh, I'm not a big fan of Italian cuisine. Do they have good vegan options?
 That could be interesting. Do they also serve drinks?
 Great. So, have you heard about Sarah and Tom's wedding?
 Oh, okay. It's just that they're having a destination wedding and I wasn't sure if you were invited.

 i am not really a sports person.
 No, I don't. I'm not really into traveling.

 Ugh, I hate those. I really don't see the appeal.
 No, I try to avoid that stuff. It's all so negative and stressful.
 Not really, it's all just a bunch of stuffy old paintings.
 Which match are you talking about?
 No, I missed it. I'm not much of a football fan.
 I'm into horror movies, how about you?
 Yeah, comedies are good too. Do you watch stand-up comedy?
 Fair enough. Hey, have you heard about the new sushi place that just opened in town?

 It's good.
 No, I haven't heard.
 No, I can't eat seafood.
 I'm not really into sports.
 Yeah, I love traveling!
 No, I haven't had the chance to go yet.
 Not really, no.
 No, I don't really have any interest in gardening.
 To be honest, not really.
 Yes, I have a dog.
 Yes, it was nice talking to you too. See you around!
 No, I didn't have the time yet.
 Sounds interesting. What's the name of the show?
 Hmm, I don't know if I'd be interested in that. So, what else is new with you?
 Honestly, I'm a little stressed lately. Trying to keep up with work and also deal with some family drama.
 No, thank you, but I think I'll be fine. It's just a rough patch.
 Yeah, that's true. It's just hard to see that sometimes in the moment.
 Aww, he's doing great! He's so cute and he's really starting to learn some tricks.
 He can sit, lie down, and roll over! It's so much fun to teach him new things.
 Yes, I tried out this amazing Mexican place last week.
 Oh, I had the best tacos of my life there.
 No, I haven't had time to catch up on it. No spoilers please.
 Honestly, I'm not a big sports person. My friends tell me I'm missing out, but it's just not my thing.
 I do. I recently finished Stephen King's new novel. It's fantastic.
 Not really. I prefer comedies or romantic movies.
 I really enjoyed "The Notebook". Have you watched it?
 No, I'm an only child.
 I can imagine. Hey, sorry, but I have to go now. Nice talking to you.
 It was alright.
 No, I didn't. That's terrible.
 Hopefully, we never have to experience it. Talking about fearing for disaster brings me down.
 Actually, yes! I went to a new sushi place downtown. It was amazing.
 It's called Hana Fuji. You should definitely check it out sometime.
 No, I have never been out of the country.
 Yeah, it would be awesome to travel. However, it may not be affordable for everyone. Talking about traveling and not being able to go is a downer for me.
 That's a good point. I'll definitely start planning something.
 Sure, let's plan on it.
 Not really, I'm not a big reader.
 I enjoy playing video games and watching TV shows.
 I like playing FIFA, but I also enjoy playing Call of Duty.
 No, I haven't.
 Sure, I watch movies occasionally.

 That's great to hear. Wait, do you like horror movies?
 I just watched this new movie called "The Conjuring", and it was so thrilling! You should watch it sometime.

 Actually, I've been reading a lot lately. Are you into reading at all?
 Mostly non-fiction books on history and science. You?
 That's cool. Have you ever traveled to any exotic destinations?

 Not really, I can't handle spicy food.
 Nah, I'm not really into sci-fi.
 Actually, I'm not really a fan of those either.
 Well, I'm really into classic films. Have you seen Citizen Kane?

 Actually, no, I don't. I prefer to read books instead.
 I'm mostly into historical fiction. But I'm also a big fan of biographies.
 I just finished a biography of Winston Churchill. It was really fascinating.

 I do! I actually just went on a weekend trip to a nearby national park and did some hiking. It was amazing.
 Yeah, definitely not. I actually use a laundry service so I don't have to deal with it myself.
 Well, you just leave your dirty clothes outside your door and they pick them up and bring them back clean within a few days. It's really convenient.
 I haven't. What kind of food do they serve?
 Oh, I love sushi. Let's definitely check it out sometime.
 No, I didn't. Honestly, I'm not really into sports.
 Not really, I haven't had time.
 Yeah, actually...I really loved Breaking Bad.
 Hmm, sounds good. I'll have to check it out. By the way, did you see the game last night?
 Ah, gotcha. So, uh, have you done anything interesting lately?

 No problem, talk to you later.
 Yeah, I love playing video games.
 Right now, I'm really into Valorant.
 It's a first-person shooter game with a really competitive atmosphere.
 Yeah, I can see why. Do you like any other types of games?
 Oh, that's cool. I haven't played Sudoku in a while.
 Definitely. Hey, have you seen any good movies lately?
 Oh, that's a shame. I saw the new James Bond movie the other day, and it was really good.
 Ah, gotcha. What about TV shows? Do you watch anything good?
 Hmm, sounds interesting. I'll have to check it out.
 I'll definitely have to give it a try. Listen, I have to get back to work now. It was great talking to you!
 It was pretty boring to be honest.
 Not really, let's talk about something else.
 Well, I like reading books and watching movies.
 I enjoy all kinds of movies, but mostly I like action and thriller.
 No, I'm not much of a sports person.

 Not really my thing either. Sorry.
 Well, I like to watch TV shows and play video games. How about you?
 I like playing first-person shooter games like Call of Duty. What about you?
 Yeah, I hear you. I haven't either.
 Unfortunately not, I had a really busy summer.
 Yes, I went on a road trip across the country. That was pretty cool.
 We passed through a bunch of states, like Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.
 Well, it was alright. The heat was intense and it was pretty crowded.
 I usually just relax at home and read a book or watch a movie.
 That's cool, I've never really been much of an outdoors person.
 Definitely, relaxation is important.
 Sounds good, talk to you later.
 No, I haven't. Are they any good?
 Oh, that sounds nice. I love Italian cuisine.
 No, I haven't. To be honest, it's not really my thing.
 I'm not a big fan, to be honest.
 No, I haven't. What's the company?

 Wow, that's really cool.
 Not really, just planning to catch up on some sleep and maybe binge-watch some TV shows.
 I'm mostly into crime dramas and thrillers. How about you?

 Pretty average.
 No, I haven't.
 I'm not really a fan of burgers, to be honest.
 Not really.
 I prefer reading books, actually.
 Yeah, I actually just finished a really interesting biography. Would you like me to recommend it?

 To be honest, I'm not much of a reader.
 I don't think so, I'm not really into hiking. Thanks though.
 Yes, I have been there a few times.
 Definitely the food. There's nothing quite like authentic Japanese cuisine.
 It's hard to pick just one, but I really enjoy sushi and ramen.
 No, I haven't. To be honest, I don't think I could give up meat.

 Yeah, I love Italian food! Do you know any good Italian restaurants around here?
 Yeah, I have. It was okay, but I think there are better Italian restaurants around.
 Well, have you tried Il Forno? Their pizzas are amazing.
 Yeah, I have. But to be honest, I'm not really a big concert person. I prefer just listening to music on my headphones.

 Sounds interesting, I might check it out.

 She's 25, same as me.
 Uh, no. I don't really enjoy talking about taxes.
 Not really, those are pretty much all of my hobbies.
 It was pretty boring.

 I like action movies, but I'm not really picky.

 No, not really. I'm kind of a picky eater, to be honest.
 No, not really.
 I like to read a book or listen to music.
 I like rock and metal music, and I mostly read fantasy and science fiction novels.

 Not good, I have been dealing with a headache all day.
 I don't know, it could be the weather.
 Yeah, I took some aspirin earlier.
 Honestly, I didn't watch it.
 I heard it's pretty pricey.
 That's good to know. Speaking of expensive things, what's your opinion on luxury cars?

 I enjoy reading books and watching movies. What about you?

 Yeah, I just finished "Stranger Things".
 I've watched it before, but to be honest, it's not really my thing.
 Actually, I'm more into documentaries. How about you?
 That's cool. You know, I've been trying to eat healthier lately and I watched a few documentaries about veganism - they were really eye-opening.
 Yeah, it's definitely not for everyone. Speaking of food, have you ever tried Ethiopian cuisine?
 It's really different from anything I've tried before. They serve everything on a big platter with injera bread, and you're supposed to eat with your hands. Would you be interested in trying it sometime?
 Work's been pretty boring, to be honest. Just the usual stuff day in and day out.
 Not really. I've just been playing video games in my free time. The new "Call of Duty" is pretty fun.
 Not really, I think they've made it pretty accessible for newcomers. But I don't know, it might not be for everyone. By the way, sorry if I seem kind of down today. It's just been a tough week.
 Thanks, I appreciate it. Honestly, I've just been dealing with some family drama lately and it's been really stressful.
 No, it's okay. I appreciate the offer, but I think I just need some time to myself right now. Anyway, I should probably get going. It was good catching up with you.
 Not really, I accidentally stumbled across a true-crime documentary last week. It was pretty captivating.
 'The Staircase'. Have you watched it?
 Hmm, well it's pretty heavy going. Honestly, sometimes it's a bit too much and I just can't watch it.
 Honestly, I don't really want to talk about it. I find it pretty frustrating and overwhelming.
 Well, I've been trying to get better at cooking recently.
 Lately, I've been loving making different kinds of soup. They're really versatile and easy to make.
 Not really, I feel like I don't really have time for much else.
 Yeah, definitely. Talk to you soon.
 No, I'm not really into TV shows.

 Yeah, I'd recommend watching Parasite. It's a really well-done Korean movie that won a bunch of awards.

 I've always wanted to go to Hawaii, but it's so expensive.
 Not really, I haven't been to the theater in ages.

 I'm into science-fiction and fantasy genres. Do you like them too?
 Hmm, I'm not really into those. But hey, have you seen that new Netflix documentary on John McAfee?
 He's a controversial tech mogul who's been accused of many things. Nevermind, it's not important.
 Good, thanks.
 Not really, I find them pretty boring.
 I love books! What kind of books do you like?
 Yes, I just finished reading "The Girl on the Train" and it was amazing.
 Hmm, it's hard to pick just one. I would say "The Shawshank Redemption".
 Yeah, I like them but there are some that are just not funny at all.
 No, I haven't had the chance to travel a lot. But I would love to go someday.
 Ugh, I don't really want to talk about politics right now. Sorry.
 I like all kinds of food, but my favorite is Italian. What about you?
 No, I haven't. Is it any good?
 Yeah, that sounds like a great idea. Let's make plans soon!
 No, I don't really follow sports.
 Not me. What about you, though? Which sports do you like?
 Hmm, I've never been a big fan myself.
 No, not really. I've just been working a lot.
 I don't really take vacations. I mostly just stay at home and relax.
 No, I haven't had time to watch any movies lately.
 I guess I like action movies, but I haven't really seen a good one in a while.
 Hmm, that does sound interesting. Maybe I'll check it out sometime.
 Yeah, I did. It was a great thriller novel.
 It was 'The Silent Patient.' Have you read it?
 It's about a painter who murders her husband, but then stops speaking, and one psychotherapist tries to uncover the truth.
 Oh no, that's terrible. I hate working on weekends.
 No, I missed it. I'm not interested in that show anyway.
 I'm sorry, but I'm not really interested in tech stuff.
 Bye! See you soon.
 Nothing much, just feeling a bit bored.
 Actually, I haven't watched any movies recently.
 Unfortunately, no. I have been cooking at home to save money.
 I used to like it, but now I am not interested anymore.
 I'm not really a bookworm. I only read books when I have to.
 Honestly, I don't have any hobbies. I find them to be a waste of time.
 I mostly just stay at home and watch TV.
 Yeah, let's talk about something else. Maybe something more interesting.
 No, I didn't. What game are you talking about?
 Not really. I'm more into soccer.
 Manchester United all the way!
 Yeah, I went to this new sushi place downtown. It was amazing!
 I'm not sure, I didn't really look at the menu. But I can ask for you if you want.
 Not really, I don't have celiac disease or anything like that. Why do you ask?
 No, I didn't. What kind of museum is it?
 Ugh, contemporary art? I don't really get it.
 It was great! I finished reading a book that I loved.
 It was "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho. Have you read it?
 Definitely worth the read. What do you like to do in your free time?
 I love cooking! Do you cook?
 That's okay. Cooking can be fun when you know the basics.
 Yeah, but the rewards are worth it in the end. Do you like sports?
 Hmm, what about outdoor activities? Do you like hiking or camping?
 That's understandable. Everyone has their own interests. Hey, look at the time. I need to leave now.
 Yeah, I'm not really interested in it though.
 I know, but I don't really care about those things.
 Hmm, I guess I like Italian food the most.
 No, I haven't heard of it.

 Honestly, not really. I find reading to be a bit boring.
 No, I'm not really into sports either.
 I usually just watch TV. Do you have any favorite shows you would recommend?
 It was nice. I went on a trip to the beach.
 I swam, played frisbee, volleyball, and had a picnic with friends.
 No, I haven't, but I'd love to try sometime.
 No, I haven't. I've never seen snow before.
 That sounds great. Do you have a favorite snowboarding spot?
 Pretty good, thanks for asking. How about you?
 Not really, I've just been re-watching The Office.
 No, I haven't.
 I don't know, I don't really read for fun anymore.
 No, I haven't been anywhere in a while.
 Honestly, I've just been binge-watching Netflix a lot.
 Sorry, not really my thing. I don't drink much.

 No, I haven't.
 Sorry, I can't. I'm swamped with work right now.
 Not really, I try to stay organized without relying too much on apps.
 Honestly, I wasn't a big fan of it. I thought the writing was pretty weak.
 Yes, I have. I went to Japan a few years ago and it was amazing.

 Nothing much, maybe just watch some TV or read a book.
 No, I'm not really into holidays. I find them overrated.
 I don't like how people get so caught up in the commercial aspect of it. It's really just a way for businesses to make money.

 Actually, I'm not much of a reader.
 Yeah, I've been watching this show called "Love Island." It's kind of mindless, but it's entertaining.
 It's basically a group of attractive people stuck in a villa in Fiji trying to find love. It's pretty ridiculous, honestly.
 Yeah, it's definitely not for everyone. What do you like to do to relax?
 No, I haven't listened to any of his stuff since "Baby" came out like a decade ago.
 I'm into more obscure stuff, like experimental noise rock and ambient techno. It's not for everyone, but I really love it.

 No, I'm not really into sports. I find them kind of boring, to be honest.

 Oh, yeah? What kind of food do they serve?
 That sounds interesting. I'd love to try that sometime.
 Sorry, can't make it. I have a dentist appointment.
 It's okay, I guess. Nothing too serious.
 No, I haven't. What are they?
 Ugh, that's so annoying.
 No, I haven't. I'm not really interested in Asia at all, to be honest.

 Eh, I don't mind it. I'm not a very active person.
 Yeah, maybe. But honestly, I hate working out. It's so boring.
 I mostly just like to read or play video games in my free time.
 Mostly science fiction and fantasy.
 Yup, I love those books!
 Agreed. It's amazing how much detail and world-building  Tolkien was able to fit into those books.
 Yeah, I did.
 Honestly, I think it's overrated.
 I love Friends!
 Yeah, I did. I'm definitely not interested.
 No, I didn't.
 Not yet, but I want to check it out.
 I don't really have a specific order, but I would love to try new things.

 Okay, nice talking to you. Take care!
 It was terrible. I had a never-ending meeting that lasted for hours.
 Not really. I'm tired of hearing about it all the time.
 To be honest, I don't really have time for TV. I'd rather do something more productive instead.
 I've been getting into gardening recently. I find it really therapeutic.
 Yeah, it's surprising even to me how much I've been enjoying it.
 Definitely fruits and vegetables. I like to grow my own food whenever possible.
 Not at the moment. I think I'll hold off until things calm down with the pandemic.
 I have, but it's been a bit difficult since we can't meet in person.
 Not much, just binge-watched some TV shows.
 Mostly crime dramas, like "Mindhunter" and "True Detective".
 Definitely. The first season is a little slow, but it really picks up in the second season.
 Eh, I think they're both good in their own way. But "True Detective" is a bit too dark for me sometimes.
 Not really, I find them to be a bit boring, to be honest.
 No, I'm not really into sports either.
 I like playing video games and reading.
 Yeah, I have. It looks pretty cool.
 Yeah, it is. But you get what you pay for, right?
 Not really, they're kind of boring.
 I like watching crime shows. They're really interesting.
 You should check out "Mindhunter" on Netflix. It's a really good one.
 I'm not a big fan of romance movies, they're too sappy.
 I do. Nothing like watching some good old-fashioned butt-kicking.

 It's called "The Rise of Skywalker". It's a sequel to the Star Wars movies.
 Got it. What kind of books do you like to read?

 Yeah, I just listened to a podcast about the Zodiac Killer. Have you ever heard of him?
 That's fair. Hey, I gotta go now. Good talking to you!
 It was great! I got a promotion at work!
 I work for a tech company.
 Yes, tech is the future, and I love to work in a place where we can implement new ideas every day.
 There are so many things that I learned, but the most important thing is to keep learning and growing. It's essential to keep up with the industry and learn new skills.
 Oh, sorry, I am not a fan of traveling.
 I don't like to cook, but I enjoy eating good food. Do you enjoy cooking?
 Sorry, I'm not that into food, and I do not have a favorite.

 The edamame was meh, but their tempura is definitely worth trying.
 Not really, I'm not much of a reader.
 Actually, I just finished watching a new sci-fi show and it was fantastic!

 Not sure, I guess action movies are okay sometimes.
 I don't really listen to music that much.

 Sorry, I don't drink red wine. It gives me headaches.
 Not really. I don't watch sports that often.
 Ugh, please no. I'd rather talk about anything else than politics.
 Actually, I just finished binge-watching a show last night. It's called Breaking Bad, do you know it?
 Honestly, I loved everything about it. The writing, the acting, the cinematography...it was all amazing. But I think my favorite episode was the one where they steal the train.
 Yeah, it's pretty slick.
 Definitely. I'm really interested in renewable technology.
 Not really. What's that?
 Hmm, sounds cool.
 No, sorry, I'm not really interested in that kind of thing.
 I'm into sci-fi and comedy. How about you?
 Hmm, that's not really my thing.

 Not much, just been binge-watching this new show I found on Netflix.
 It's called The Crown.
 Yeah, if you're into historical dramas, you'll love it.
 If you're into sci-fi, I recently watched this show on Amazon called The Expanse. It's pretty good, but it has a bit of a slow start.
 That's fair. Oh, have you heard about the new tax bill that's going to Congress?
 Yeah, I get that. How about sports? Do you follow any teams?
 Not good, I feel sick.
 No, but I'm afraid of getting it.
 Not really, Netflix only has bad movies lately.

 Yeah, I saw Parasite a few weeks ago. It was amazing.
 It's about a poor family who slowly infiltrates the lives of a rich family for their own financial gain, but things take a dark turn.
 Honestly, I try not to. It's too depressing.
 Actually, I've been playing Animal Crossing non-stop since it came out.
 It's a life simulation game where you move to a deserted island and build it up from scratch. It's really relaxing and fun.
 Not really, I think that's plenty for me.
 Oh, I'm not much into sci-fi movies.
 Sorry, not my thing either.

 I like fantasy and science-fiction mostly. Speaking of which, have you watched Star Wars?
 I'd say it's a tie between The Empire Strikes Back and Rogue One. Which one's your favorite?
 Yeah, I couldn't get into the prequels either. So, do you have any other favorite book genres besides non-fiction and historical fiction?
 That's cool. I haven't read many mysteries myself, but maybe I'll give them a try sometime.
 Sure, I highly recommend the Mistborn trilogy by Brandon Sanderson. It's a fantastic blend of magic, action, and politics.
 No, I haven't.
 I don't really like sushi all that much.

 Well, I like to do some gardening in my free time.
 Mostly fruits and vegetables. It's nice to grow my own food, and it's good for the environment.

 Not really, I've been focusing on reading more books lately.
 It's called "Atomic Habits" by James Clear.
 It's about building good habits and breaking bad ones.
 It's got some really practical advice and strategies, and the author presents it in a really clear and engaging way.
 No, I don't really have any interest in it, to be honest.
 Yeah, I think I'll stick to less risky hobbies. Like cooking, for example.
 I really like making homemade pasta. There's something really satisfying about the process, and the end result is always delicious.
 It's actually pretty easy, you should give it a try sometime! Speaking of food, have you heard of the carnivore diet?
 Yeah, exactly. I'm not sure if I would ever actually try it, but it's definitely an interesting concept.
 Sorry, not really my thing.
 I'm actually not really into music either. Sorry to be such a bore!

 No problem, it was nice talking to you. See you later!
 Yes, I watched "Tenet" recently. It had an interesting concept.
 I am into gardening. It's therapeutic.
 Mostly herbs and vegetables. Right now, I am growing some lavender and basil.
 Sure. If you're a beginner, you should start with some easy-to-grow plants like mint, oregano, or spinach. Also, don't forget to water them regularly!
 Actually no, I haven't. Skydiving is definitely not my cup of tea.
 You too, take care.

 Oh, I love Italian food!
 Pretty good, thanks.

 Not really, I feel like everything on Netflix is starting to look the same.
 No, I haven't watched any James Bond films. Honestly, I find them pretty boring.
 Yeah, my sister is visiting from out of town so I'm planning to take her around the city. What about you?
 Nope, I'm not really into reading these days.

 Oh, I'm feeling pretty good.
 Not really, I might just stay at home and watch some TV.
 I'm watching this new show called "The Crown." It's pretty boring, to be honest.
 It's about the British royal family, but the pacing is really slow and the characters are kind of dull.
 Yeah, I might switch to something else. Do you have any recommendations?
 No, I'm not really into cooking.
 Actually, I watched this terrible movie the other day. It was so bad that I turned it off halfway through.

 That sounds great! When are you free?
 Sorry, I'm busy then. Maybe the following Wednesday?
 Oh no thanks, I prefer to take the bus.

 That's cool. I prefer indoor activities. Hiking sounds exhausting to me.

 Hmm, sounds cool. Is it online or offline?
 Nice, I'll have to check it out sometime. Talking about games, did you ever play Fortnite?
 Yeah, same here. Speaking of getting bored of things quickly, have you tried any new recipes lately?
 Ah, that's too bad. I've been cooking a lot lately, and it's been a great stress-reliever. How's your job going?

 I love reading. I just finished a really good book about World War II. You should check it out sometime.

 Hmm, that's tough. I would probably say Princess Margaret. What about you?

 No, I haven't. What's it called?
 Ugh, I hate burgers.
 I used to, but I've kind of grown out of it.
 Not really. I'm not really into sports.
 I usually just like to read or watch movies at home.
 I like sci-fi and fantasy books, and for movies, I like comedies and action films.
 Yeah, it's always nice to find common interests with people.
 Yeah, you too. Take care!
 Not much, just stayed in and binge-watched a TV show.
 It was Friends, have you watched it?
 He's funny, but I prefer Joey.
 Just some leftovers, nothing special.
 No, COVID-19 has got us all locked down at home.
 Just work, work, and more work. It's always crazy this time of the year.
 Not really, I've been busy with work.
 I'm a software engineer.
 Yeah, it's fine, pays the bills.
 Not really, I've been too busy with work.
 Actually, no. I'm more of an indoor person.
 Not really, I don't listen to music that much.
 No, not really. I get homesick easily.
 Sure, that sounds good. I like Italian food.
 Yeah, there's a new one that opened up down the street. They have really good pizza.
 Yeah, that sounds good.
 I am doing great. Thanks for asking.
 Not really, I am thinking about binge-watching a new TV show. What about you?
 That sounds interesting. I have never been camping before.
 I am not much of a TV person.
 Yes, I do. I mostly listen to pop and hip-hop music.
 I like Ariana Grande. What about you?
 Honestly, I don't like talking about politics. It just stresses me out.
 Not really. I'm not a big fan of sports.
 Yes, I love trying new dishes. Thai cuisine is my favorite. How about you?
 I like Pad Thai the most. What about you?
 No, I didn't. I'm not really into sports.
 It was good. I went hiking with some friends.
 We went to the Appalachian Trail. There were some really beautiful views.
 Yeah, definitely do. Hey, have you been keeping up with the news lately?
 Well, the wildfires in California are still raging. It's really sad to see all the devastation.
 Yeah, me too. Anyway, what movies have you seen recently?
 No, I haven't. I heard it's really dark, though.
 Not really. I watched "The Lion King" with my little cousin a few weeks ago, but it wasn't really my thing.
 I listen to all kinds of music. Lately, I've been really into lo-fi hip hop.
 It was alright, nothing too exciting happened.
 Not really, I haven't been to a concert in years.
 I'm really into classical music. Do you like it?
 I find it really soothing and calming. The complexity of the music is incredible.
 That's alright, everyone has different tastes. What about movies? Have you seen anything good lately?
 I really like romantic comedies. What about you?
 Oh, I see. Action movies can be fun too, but sometimes they can get overwhelming. What kind of action movies do you like?
 Not the greatest, honestly.
 Just a lot going on at work. We're behind on some projects, and my boss has been giving me a hard time.
 Mostly by listening to music and taking breaks throughout the day.
 I'm really into indie rock and alternative music. What about you?
 Oh yeah, I actually listened to it already. It's pretty good!
 Not really. Honestly, I try to avoid thinking about it too much.
 Actually, I have! I just finished watching this really interesting documentary about space exploration.
 Yeah, it was called "Journey to the Edge of the Universe".
 Not really, but thanks for asking! I'll talk to you later.
 No, I don't really follow basketball.
 Sorry, not interested in that either.
 Actually, yes. I just finished a very interesting novel.
 It's a historical fiction novel that takes place during World War II, and it follows the story of a young Jewish girl who is trying to survive.
 Honestly, I'm not very interested in food.
 Not really, I just eat to stay alive.
 Sorry, I don't really watch movies either.
 Nope, not really into video games either.
 See you.
 No, I haven't.

 No, I don't really go to concerts that often.

 Not really, no.
 Not really. Just catching up on sleep and doing some errands.
 No, I haven't.
 I don't really like sushi.
 I'm a vegetarian.
 I just don't like the idea of eating animals. Plus, there are so many delicious vegetarian dishes out there.
 Not really. There are so many great meat substitutes these days that taste just as good.
 Not really. I don't really watch TV.
 No, sorry. I haven't really had time to watch any movies lately.
 Yeah, it was nice talking to you too.
 It was kind of boring, I didn't do much.
 Yeah, maybe. Speaking of which, have you tried that new restaurant that opened up downtown?
 Honestly, no. The food wasn't that great.
 Yeah, I saw "Parasite" last week. It was amazing.
 No, not really.
 Not really, I'm trying to save up money.
 Actually, yes! I just finished "The Midnight Library" and it was really good.
 I liked the premise - it's about a woman who gets to explore all the different paths her life could have taken if she had made different choices. It's a really interesting concept.
 No, I don't like chess.
 Yeah, I like Monopoly.
 Umm, I usually try to buy as many properties as I can.

 Nothing exciting, but it's going okay.
 No, not yet. Is it any good?
 Yeah, that sounds good. I love trying new food.
 Not really, I'm not much of a reader.
 Yeah, I love action movies. The recent James Bond movie was really good.
 Not really, with the pandemic and everything, I'm not sure what I'll be able to do.
 Honestly, I've been trying not to think too much about it. It's been pretty overwhelming lately.
 I've been here my whole life, basically. How about you?
 Yeah, there's this great coffee shop on Main Street that I love. They have the best pastries.
 It was okay.
 Just worked from home all day. Pretty boring honestly.
 I'm a financial analyst.
 Yeah, it can be. So, what do you do for a living?
 Yeah, I hear that's a growing field.
 Not really, not since the pandemic started.
 Mostly just watch TV or play video games.
 Mostly just first-person shooters.
 Not really. I'm not very athletic.
 Yeah, I like watching crime dramas.
 SVU.
 Yeah, you should. Well, it was nice talking to you, but I have to go.
 You too.
 Yeah, I love it.
 Definitely Japan. The culture and the food were amazing.
 Of course! It was one of the best I've ever had.
 No, and I don't think I want to.
 Yeah, I like indie rock. What about you?
 No, I haven't.
 No, I don't.
 You too.
 Good, thanks.
 Yeah, I watched The Social Dilemma.
 It was interesting, but also kind of scary.
 Same here.
 Not really. I think most influencers are pretty superficial.

 Great, take care!
 Yeah, I did.
 I don't really have a favorite team.
 Not really, it's not my thing.
 Actually, no. I don't like raw fish.
 Yeah, I like Mexican food a lot!
 I'd say it's between tacos and enchiladas.
 No, I don't. I'm not really a pet person, to be honest.
 Yeah, I really like Radiohead.
 Yeah, they're definitely not for everyone.
 Honestly, I'm a bit of a homebody. I mostly just like to read and watch TV.
 Yeah, I'm not really much of a party person or anything.
 Yeah, you too. Bye!
 Not really, no.
 Hmm, I'm not really in the mood for a heavy topic like that right now, sorry.
 Actually, I'm not really interested in talking about that, either. Sorry.
 I'm not much of a reader, sorry.
 Honestly, I think I'm just kind of bored of talking right now. Maybe some other time?
 Not really, I'm not much of a reader.
 Sorry, still not interested.
 Actually, yes. I just watched this really great crime show.
 Well, if you're into comedies, there's this new show that just came out.
 Some people you may have heard of, but I'm not really sure.
 Honestly, I just like to relax and do nothing.
 Yeah, I'm really not an active person.
 No, I haven't gone anywhere in a while.
 Yeah, it's just not really my thing.
 No, I haven't. But I'm not really interested in going.
 Yes, I love traveling.
 I went to Bali last summer. It was beautiful.
 You should definitely visit it.
 Really? Why is that?
 I can understand why you would feel that way, but flying is very safe. Have you tried any techniques to overcome your fear?
 You can try booking a window seat or taking deep breaths. It may help you feel more comfortable during the flight.
 You're welcome. By the way, do you like to read books?
 I see. What are some of your favorite movies?
 I like Die Hard too. But I'm not a big fan of action movies.
 Yes, I like to play basketball in my free time.
 Sorry, I'm busy these days. Maybe some other time.
 Sorry, I have plans already. Maybe some other time.

 I like both, depending on my mood. What about you?
 No, I haven't, and I don't think I ever will! It's not my thing.
 No, I haven't. Honestly, I'm not much of a winter person.
 No, I don't. I'm allergic to cats, and dogs require too much work.
 I enjoy pop music for the most part, but I also dabble in a little bit of hip hop. What about you?
 Yes, I've been to a few concerts. They can be fun, but they're not really my thing.
 It was okay.
 Just some errands and housework.
 Yes, I think so.
 No, I decided to skip it.
 Not really.
 Yeah, I feel you.
 Sorry, I'm not really a fitness expert.
 I like to read books and watch TV shows.
 Mostly fiction and fantasy.
 Not really, I'm not a big fan.
 Not really, I prefer TV shows.
 Right now, I'm watching a documentary series. It's about unsolved mysteries.

 It was good, thanks for asking. I just relaxed at home.
 No, I'm not really a sports fan.
 I like hip hop and R&B.
 Yeah, I really like Drake.
 That's fine. Do you listen to any classical music instead?
 Sorry, I find talking about the weather a bit pointless.
 No, I didn't. But I don't really care much about new restaurants.
 Not really. Just thinking about what to eat for dinner. Wanna talk about food?
 I'm a big fan of Italian food.
 Yeah, I like going to Mamma Mia.
 Great. Well, I gotta run now. Talk to you later!
 It was alright.
 Not really, just stayed home and watched TV.
 Just some news and a documentary about farming. It was pretty boring.
 No, I stayed in the whole time.
 That's great to hear. What kind of food was it?
 Not really, I'm not a big fan of spicy food.
 I prefer Italian food. Pizza and pasta are my favorites.
 Not really, I usually just go to a chain restaurant.
 No, I haven't.
 That sounds interesting, what kind of toppings do they have?
 Ooh, mac and cheese! That sounds really good.
 No, I'm not really into sports.
 I'm sure it was, but sports just aren't really my thing.
 Actually, now that you mention it, I did just watch a really good one on Netflix. It was a documentary about the history of the internet.
 Yeah, it was really fascinating. By the way, did you hear about the new tax law that just got passed?
 Not really, I've just been at work a lot.
 I work in an office doing customer service. It's not very exciting.
 Honestly, I don't have much free time between work and taking care of my kids.
 They're four and six.
 Not really. They're still pretty young so they mostly just like playing with toys.
 Not really, I usually just get whatever's on TV.
 Not really. I just watch whatever's on.
 Not great, spent most of it catching up on work.
 Actually, I'm trying to cut back on eating out. Can we try cooking something at home instead?
 I don't know, something easy. How about spaghetti carbonara?
 Not really, I haven't had much time for movies lately.
 Not really, I mostly just watch the news.
 Not really, I don't get the appeal of podcasts.
 Same here. I'll see you later then!
 No, I haven't.
 I do love sushi.
 No, I haven't. What is it?
 That does sound interesting. Where can you find it?
 I haven't, sorry.
 I did catch the latest Star Wars movie, it was fantastic.
 Kinda. I enjoy watching the occasional sci-fi show or movie, but I'm not really into it.
 Yeah, there's just so much to choose from. Have you seen The Expanse?
 Yeah, same here. Take care!
 Yeah, actually I saw the new Nolan film. It was amazing.
 To be honest, I never got into Harry Potter.
 Actually, I've been binge-watching this show on Netflix. It's called The Crown.
 It's a historical drama about Queen Elizabeth II's reign. You should definitely check it out.
 Honestly, I like to just hang out and watch movies or play video games. Simple stuff, you know.
 Not really. I haven't had much time to read lately.
 Ugh, sorry man. I really am not much of a music person. So I don't really have a favorite music genre or anything.
 Same to you. Talk to you later!
 No, not really. I try to avoid it.
 Ugh, not really interested in that.
 Actually, I just watched the latest Star Wars movie. It was okay.
 Yeah, me too. The newer ones just don't have the same feel.
 Oh, I'm not really into those classic movies.
 Not anymore. I used to play a lot, but I don't have the time for it anymore.
 Yeah, I know. But I just have other priorities now.
 I enjoy going for walks and cooking.
 It's a lot of fun once you get the hang of it.
 Yeah, no problem. Talk to you later.
 No, I have not caught up with it.
 Oh, not interested.
 Actually, I saw the latest horror movie from director James Wan.
 Not really. I just stick to my usual places.
 Hmm, not a big fan of sushi.
 It's been pretty hot lately. I'm not a big fan.
 Me too. But honestly, I'm not really in the mood to talk about the weather. We can change the topic if you want.
 No, I haven't been there yet.
 Hmm, I'm not sure. I'm not a big fan of sushi.
 Honestly, I just like fast food. It's quick and easy.
 No, I think I'll stick to fast food.
 Not much really, just watching TV or playing video games.
 No, I'm not really into hiking or anything like that. I just like to relax on weekends.
 Sorry, I can't. I promised I'd help my sister move this weekend.
 No, I haven't.
 Hmm, I haven't played video games in a while, but I heard it's good.
 Yeah, I do! I just finished a great mystery novel last week.
 Yeah, I can appreciate a good non-fiction book. Do you have any recommendations?
 Hmm, sounds interesting. I'll have to check it out later.
 Really? That's pretty surprising.
 No, I am not a fan of horror movies.
 What about you? Do you like horror movies?
 Which sci-fi movie is your favorite?
 Inception is a great movie. By the way, do you like video games?
 What kind of video games do you enjoy the most?
 That's really cool. Do you play online games?
 Oh, okay.  Do you want to talk about something else?
 Not really. Unfortunately, I haven't had the chance to travel much lately.
 Mostly just relax at home, read books or watch a movie. What about you? What do you like to do on weekends?
 I'm doing alright, thanks. How about you?
 No, I haven't had the chance to watch it yet. What's it about?
 That sounds kind of boring to me, but I'm glad you enjoyed it.
 Yeah, I actually tried it last week. The food was kind of bad.
 I had the pasta dish, but the noodles were overcooked and the sauce was bland. I wouldn't recommend it.
 Well, I like to read books and go hiking. How about you?
 No, I haven't had much time to play games recently. Is it any good?
 That doesn't sound like my kind of game, but I'm glad you enjoy it.
 Goodbye, take care.
 I'm doing well.
 No, I haven't. What kind of place is it?
 Oh, I love dumplings. I'll have to check it out.
 Not really, I just like food in general.
 Yeah, I have, but it's not really my thing.
 Not really, I'm not a big sports person.
 Not really, I haven't had the chance to watch any movies lately.
 No, I've been trying to avoid the news as much as possible. It's been really depressing lately.
 Definitely. Anyway, I have to get going now. It was nice chatting with you.
 I'm good, thanks.
 No, I didn't get a chance to watch it yet.
 I will, thanks for the recommendation.
 I usually listen to pop music.
 I like Taylor Swift. What about you?
 Oh, I don't really like rock music.
 Well, not really. I spend most of my free time watching TV.
 I like watching reality shows.
 No, I don't really read books.
 Yeah, maybe. Anyway, I gotta go. Talk to you later.
 I'm good. Thanks for asking.
 Yes, I did. I'm not much of an Apple person though.
 I have an Android phone.
 Yeah, I love music. It helps me relax after a hard day.
 Well, it really depends on the mood I'm in. But I listen to all types of music except for Country.
 Not really, I find it boring.
 Yeah, I enjoy watching movies, but mostly in theaters.
 Sorry, I don't really feel like discussing that topic today.
 Actually, I'm not much of a cook. I prefer eating out.
 You too, take care.
 No, I haven't heard anything about it.
 Hmm, I'm not much of a foodie.
 Yeah, I saw one last week. It was pretty good.
 I think it was called "The Quiet Place".
 Yeah, it was pretty intense. I don't usually watch horror movies, but this one was really well done.
 Not really, I'm allergic to most of them.
 Sorry, I'm not really a sports fan either.
 You too. Bye!
 Not great, just stayed at home watching Netflix.
 I binge-watched Stranger Things. It's amazing, have you seen it?
 Yes, I watch it sometimes. But some episodes are too depressing.
 Not really, I prefer reading books or watching something on Netflix.
 Mostly novels, especially those mystery and crime ones. I love Agatha Christie.
 Hmm, that's not really my thing. I find them a bit boring.
 Same old, nothing exciting happened. Just lots of emails and meetings.
 Definitely. Anyway, I need to go now. It was nice talking to you.
 It's been alright, just a bit busy at work.
 I'm a software engineer.
 Yeah, it's pretty fulfilling to see the things I build come to life.
 Unfortunately, not really. Work has been taking up most of my time.
 Not really.
 I watched a horror movie over the weekend, but it wasn't really my thing.
 Yeah, I'm into action movies and thrillers.
 Yeah, I love that series.
 Same here. Anyways, I should probably get back to work. Talk to you later!
 Actually, I haven't watched any movies lately.
 I'm really into hiking and being outdoors.
 There are a lot of trails up in the mountains, but it can be pretty crowded. I often go to [insert local park name]. It's a bit smaller, but still a nice place to go for a walk.
 I haven't been to a concert in ages, honestly.
 Mostly indie rock and folk music, but I also listen to some pop and hip hop.
 Yeah, I really like [insert artist/band name]. Their lyrics are really thoughtful and their music is just beautiful.
 To be honest, I try not to think about politics too much these days. It just seems like one bad thing after another.
 No, I don't have any pets right now. I used to have a cat, but she passed away a few years ago.
 Yeah, I like dogs. They can be a lot of work, but they're also really loyal and fun to be around.
 Not really. I don't enjoy reading that much.
 I love playing video games.
 I'm into first-person shooters mostly.
 No, I haven't.
 Not really. I listen to music sometimes, but I don't have any favorites.
 I like to go hiking and camping.
 Nah, not really. I just go wherever I feel like.
 Not really, no.
 Nah, I'm not really into movies. But thanks anyway!
 I’m doing great. Thanks for asking.
 No, I haven't.
 Ah, that sounds interesting. Unfortunately, I’m not a fan of vegan food.
 I love spicy food. Anything from Indian to Mexican, bring on the heat!
 Nope, I am not really a fan of sports.
 I don't watch a lot of TV. My work keeps me occupied.
 I work in the finance industry.
 I like to listen to music and read books. What about you?
 Action and adventure are my favorites.
 Sorry, I am not really into fantasy movies.
 I like dogs. How about you?
 That's cool. Well, it was great talking to you but I have to leave now. Have a good day!
 No, I am not interested in skiing.
 Maybe, but I prefer staying at home playing video games.
 I love Call of Duty. What about you?
 That's cool. Do you like Escape Room games?
 No, I haven't. I heard it's fun though.
 Sounds like you had a great time. It's been a while since I hung out with my friends. Maybe I should plan something.
 Yeah, I've been to a couple in the past. But honestly, I'm not really into big crowds, loud music, and getting all sweaty.
 No, I've never been to a Broadway show. I think they're overrated and way too expensive.
 Not really, I haven't had much time for movies lately.
 I like to read and go hiking. What about you?
 That's cool. What's your favorite TV show right now?
 No, I haven't. I'm not really into crime dramas.
 No, I'm not really into video games either.
 Nope, not really interested in sports either.
 Not really. I just listen to whatever's on the radio.
 No, I didn't.
 No, I haven't had the chance. Is it any good?
 Oh, I see. That doesn't sound very appealing to me.
 Actually, no, I haven't been to the cinema in ages.
 Horror movies just really aren't my thing, sorry.
 Not really. I kind of stick to the same routine every week.
 Yeah, maybe. That could be fun. What kind of things are you into doing?
 No, tell me more.
 That sounds great, I love tacos. What else do they have?
 Hmm, I'm not a big fan of ceviche. And I don't drink alcohol.
 I'm more into Asian food, like sushi and ramen.
 No, I haven't. What's the name of the restaurant?
 Ah, sorry, I'm actually not that interested in sushi right now. Is there anything else new in town?
 Sorry, I'm not really into art either. I think I'm gonna head out now.
 Yeah, I did.
 I'm not really interested in gaming consoles, to be honest.
 Oh, I'm an Android user.
 Not a big fan of smartwatches either.
 I'm not really into soccer.
 Hmm, how about books? Do you like reading?
 I haven't read that one. My favorite book is "The Catcher in the Rye".
 You should definitely give it a try. It's a classic.
 Not really, I'm not much of an outdoorsy person.
 Sounds good to me.
 No, I'm not really into camping.
 I'd rather stay in a nice hotel, to be honest.
 Italian food is my absolute favorite!
 Not really, I don't eat out much.
 I usually just stay home and read.
 Sounds boring to me.
 Sure, I like listening to classical music sometimes.
 I don't really care for pop music, sorry.
 Ugh, let's not.
 No, actually. What kind of food is it?
 Oh great, I really love sushi. What's your favorite roll?
 Ahh, yes. That's a good one.
 Not really, just planning to watch some movies from my Netflix list.
 Mostly action or thriller.
 No, not really interested in watching it.
 Unfortunately, I'm not really into music that much.
 No, I try to not pay attention to news much. It's quite depressing.
 No, I'm allergic to most of them, unfortunately.
 I can understand that, but they're just not for me.
 No, I haven't.
 I don't think I would be interested, I prefer meat.
 Sure, that sounds like a good idea.
 Actually, now that you mention it, I watched an interesting documentary on climate change.
 Yeah, there were some surprising statistics about how quickly sea levels are rising.
 Honestly, I'm not sure. I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all solution.
 Not really, I don't listen to much music.
 No, I haven't.
 Not really, I don't have much interest in visiting new places.
 You too!
 No, I haven't. Is it any good?
 Oh really? That sounds fantastic. How's the environment though?
 Well, I'll take your word for it. So, how has your new job been going?
 That's great to hear. I've been meaning to ask, have you watched any good movies lately?
 Oh, I really don't like horror movies. They're just too scary for me.
 I really love romantic comedies. They're always so heartwarming.
 Yeah, I can understand why some people might not like them. Anyway, I have to go now. Talk to you later.
 Actually, I have been getting into the horror genre, so I've been reading a lot of Stephen King.
 I thought The Shining was great, but I also really enjoyed reading The Stand.
 That's cool! What kind of non-fiction books do you like?
 Oh, nice. That's not usually my kind of thing, but I can see how that would be interesting. Speaking of things that aren't my thing, have you watched any sports lately?
 Just wondering, I'm a huge basketball fan myself. Do you play any sports?
 Ah, I see. Well, that's pretty cool. Unfortunately, I have to go now, but it was nice chatting with you!
 I did. It was really good.
 It's called "Stranger Things". Have you watched it?
 Definitely Eleven.
 Ugh, I can't stand that show. It's so depressing.
 Honestly, I don't have much time to watch TV anymore. I'm usually busy with work.
 I'm an accountant. It can be pretty boring, but it pays the bills.
 Sorry, I'm not really a drinker.
 Not really. I'm not much of a sports person.
 Yeah, no problem. See you later.
 I'm doing pretty well.
 Not lately. I'm not really into concerts.
 I like all kinds of music really. But I guess if I had to choose, I'd say I like classic rock the most.
 My favorite band is Led Zeppelin. What about you?
 I do, actually.
 I really enjoy biographies and historical non-fiction.
 Not really. I find them kind of boring.
 I usually just relax at home and binge-watch shows on Netflix.
 Right now, I'm really into Stranger Things. Have you seen it?
 Sounds good. Talk to you later!
 Actually, I just finished the latest Stephen King novel. It was really intense.
 Probably The Shining. It's a classic.
 Not really.
 Honestly, I don't really care about that kind of stuff.
 Not really, but my dad is a big football fan.
 No problem, have a good one.
 Yeah, I love it.
 Don't worry, everybody started as a beginner. By the way, have you seen the new surfing gear advertisements?
 Oh, I see. So, how about hiking? Do you like that?
 Hmm, I'm the opposite. I love the outdoors. Have you ever been to a national park?
 Really? I think you should check it out. It's such a beautiful experience. But okay, how about cooking then? Do you cook a lot?
 Oh, well, that's quite the opposite of me! I love cooking and trying out new recipes. Have you tried any good restaurants lately?
 Nothing much, just binge-watching The Office for the fifth time.
 Definitely. It gets better with every watch.
 I really like Breaking Bad.
 It's about a high school chemistry teacher who starts cooking meth to provide for his family.
 Not really. I don't read much.

 I'm into video games and Netflix!
 Mostly RPGs and strategy games.
 Yeah, I heard about them, but I'm not planning on buying any new consoles as of now.
 No, not really. I might just stay in and relax. What about you?
 Oh okay, sounds tiring! I'm not really interested in talking about work, to be honest. Do you have any other topic in mind?
 No, I haven't. What's it called?
 Hmm, I love Italian cuisine. Have you been there yet?
 Sure, I'd love to join you. What time should we meet?
 Sounds good. But before that, can we grab a coffee somewhere? I'm feeling sleepy.
 Yeah, it's my favorite drink. By the way, do you want to watch a movie after dinner?
 To be honest, I'm not a big fan of movies. I usually watch documentaries on Netflix.
 It was good, I went to my grandma's house.
 Not really, just helped her with some gardening.
 Yeah, I suppose so. Do you have a garden at home?
 I know what you mean. It can be quite frustrating to see all your plants die.
 Not really, I haven't had much time for entertainment.
 Not really, I usually just play my old playlists.
 That's interesting, what's the name of the band?
 I don't think so, sorry.

 Yeah, it sounds amazing. Have you been to any other countries?
 Really? I love traveling. It's so exciting to see new places and try new things.
 No, I'm not really into sports.
 Yeah, I can understand why people like it. So, what do you do for work?
 Really? I work in marketing, and I find it really interesting.
 Haha, yeah, I can understand why you'd feel that way. Anyways, I gotta run. Nice chatting with you!
 No, I haven't.
 Nah, I don't think it's my thing.

 Yes, I have a younger sister.
 Nope! I'm not much of a pet person, to be honest.
 Well, work takes up most of my time, but I do enjoy hiking and being outdoors.
 Hmm, I would have to say the Inca Trail in Peru. It was challenging but so incredibly rewarding.
 You should definitely go if you get the chance. Alright, well it was nice chatting with you, but I need to get back to work now.
 It was decent. Didn't do much except some gardening.
 Not really. I find it too tiring.
 Well, I like to play video games, but I don't get much time for that these days.
 It's an old game called Age of Empires.
 Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of racing games. I find them a bit repetitive.
 Thanks, but I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon. Anyway, I have to go now. Talk to you later.
 No, I haven't.
 Sounds good to me. What type of Italian dishes do they serve?
 That sounds delicious.

 No, I haven't really been keeping up with that.
 Not really, just some small weekend getaways.
 Not really, I'm not much of a traveler to be honest.

 You too.
 No, I haven't. What's it called?
 Pizza sounds great. I'd love to go.

 Yes, I went to Japan last year.
 Definitely the food. Have you tried any Japanese cuisine before?
 Sushi is great. Have you been to any good sushi places around here?

 Yeah, it's definitely a special occasion kind of place. Hey, did you hear the news about the elections?
 Oh, got it. Do you like watching any sports?
 I'm not really into basketball, but I like watching football. What team do you root for?
 Ah, the Lakers. Yeah, they had a great team back in the day. But I haven't really followed basketball much lately. Do you want to talk about anything else?
 I'm good, thanks.
 Not really, just planning to stay in and relax.
 Yes, I love going to concerts!
 I really like Adele.
 She definitely has a great voice.

 Nah, I'm pretty simple when it comes to food. I just stick to the same old stuff.
 Ugh, I don't really care about music.
 Sorry, but no.

 Sounds great! I'd love to try it out sometime.
 I'm a vegetarian, so I'll have to check if they have any veg-friendly options.

 Not a big fan of sci-fi, sorry.

 No, I haven't seen it yet.
 Yeah, I watch sports mostly. Football, basketball, that kind of thing.
 That's okay. We don't have to like the same things.

 Yeah, it really can be. But enough about work, how about you? What have you been up to lately?
 Nice! Do you have any favorite guitarists?
 Oh, cool. I've never been much of a guitar guy myself, but I've heard good things about Mayer.
 Ugh, please don't even get me started on that. It's been a really tough time for all of us.

 The salmon nigiri was amazing. Have you tried it before?

 I don't really like sushi all that much, to be honest.
 I'm more into Mexican food. Have you tried that new taco place uptown?
 Oh yeah, definitely. They have the best shrimp tacos I've ever had.

 You too! Let's talk again soon.
 It was pretty boring, to be honest.
 Just stayed at home, watched some Netflix.
 A crime drama. But it wasn't that engaging.

 Not much really. Just binge-watched a new show on Netflix.
 It's called The Crown.
 Yes, that's the one. But I'm getting a bit bored of it.
 Yeah, I'm thinking of starting a new anime series. Have you watched any anime before?
 Yeah, there are a lot of great anime shows out there. You should definitely try watching some if you get the chance.
 Well, I used to be into photography, but I don't really have the time for it anymore.
 Yeah, it's a great hobby. You should definitely try it out sometime.
 Oh boy, I really don't like talking about that topic. It's just too depressing.
 Exactly. Let's talk about something else, okay? How about the weather?
 Yeah, definitely. I'm not looking forward to winter at all. Never been a fan of the cold, you know?
 No, what book?
 Thriller books are not really my thing.
 I enjoy autobiographies.
 Yeah, I recently finished "Becoming" by Michelle Obama. It was really inspiring.
 Hmm, the only other ones I've read recently were for school.
 Mechanical engineering.
 Nothing too exciting, mostly just core classes. Physics, math, etc.
 I'm not really sure. I guess just watching TV and hanging out with friends.
 I've been really into "The Office." It's hilarious.
 Probably Dwight. How about you?
 Not great. My car broke down on the way to work this morning.
 I'm not sure, but I think it's the engine.
 Yeah, but they're all booked up for the next few days.
 I already did, but I'm not really handy with this sort of thing.
 Actually, no. I've been too busy with work and other things.
 I don't really watch TV either.
 Not really. I mostly just listen to the radio in my car.
 I like to read and go for walks.
 Mostly non-fiction, like biographies and history books.
 Thanks. Have a good day.
 I’m doing fine, what’s up?
 No, tell me about it.
 Sounds like a place I would like to check out.
 So what did you do over the weekend?
 Yeah, me too. I hate the weekends when I have to run errands.
 Not really, the last movie I watched was so boring.

 Not really, I find it kind of boring.
 I've never really tried them, so I'm not sure.

 No worries, that's understandable. Well, it was nice chatting with you, but I should get going. Have a good day!
 Not really, I'm not much of a sports fan.
 Yeah, I actually just finished a really cool one.
 It was called Cyberpunk 2077, have you played it?

 Yes, it was amazing.
 It's hard to choose just one, but probably Tyrion.
 Not much, just hung out at home mostly.
 I don't know, I enjoy relaxing at home sometimes.
 I try not to, it's always depressing.
 No, I hadn't.
 That's cool, I'll have to look into it more.
 I don't have anything specific in mind yet.
 That sounds nice, let's plan on it.
 No, I haven't heard about it. What kind of food do they serve?
 I love Italian food! What's the name of the restaurant?
 No, I haven't been to Italy. I wish I could go there someday.

 Yeah, it sounds boring. So, did you watch the football game last night?

 Honestly, nothing much. Just stayed home and watched TV.
 Not really, just the usual stuff. Probably just take care of some errands.

 Not really. I prefer staying indoors most of the time.
 I don't really listen to much music, to be honest.
 Nope, I prefer silence.
 Sorry, not really interested in that either.
 Well, I'm a software engineer, if that's any help.
 It varies, but right now I'm working on a new app for tracking productivity.
 Well, for me it's all about breaking the project down into smaller, more manageable tasks. That way I can feel like I'm making progress even if the project as a whole is still a long way off.
 Sure thing, see you later.
 I'm good, thanks. How about you?
 Not really, I've been so busy with work.
 I work in finance. It's pretty boring actually.

 Sorry, I haven't traveled anywhere recently. Maybe we can talk about something else.
 No, what kind of cuisine do they serve?
 I'm not really into Italian food, but thanks for letting me know.
 I'm really into Mexican cuisine. The spicier, the better.
 Yeah, it's definitely not for everyone. So, how about the weather today?
 Interesting. Do you follow any sports teams?
 Fair enough. How about politics? Are you interested in that?
 I know what you mean. I feel the same way. Is there anything else you're interested in?
 I like music. What kind of art do you create?
 I like country music. Who is your favorite artist?
 No, I haven't. What's it about?
 Sounds interesting. But I don't really like thrillers.

 Not really, I don't follow sports at all.
 Actually, I'm not much of a movie person either.
 Mostly just hanging out with friends, playing video games, and reading books.
 Mostly RPGs and adventure games.
 Yeah, I just finished playing a really cool game called "Outer Wilds". Have you heard of it?
 It's a space exploration game where you play as an astronaut trying to uncover the secrets of a strange and mysterious solar system. It's really trippy and mind-bending.
 No, not really. I find it all kind of depressing.
 Eh, not really. I've never really been anywhere interesting, and I don't have the money to go on fancy vacations.
 Yes.
 Not really. It wasn't my thing.
 I like mystery and thriller books.
 No, I haven't.
 Hmm, okay. Maybe I will.

 Actually, now that you mention it, I did see a really great documentary about climate change.
 That's cool. I never really got into basketball. I'm more of a football fan.
 Oh, yeah? Well, what do you find interesting to watch then?
 Hiking sounds kinda boring to me. Have you traveled anywhere exciting recently?
 Eh, I've never really been interested in Japan. It just seems overhyped to me.
 Yeah, that's a good point. Nice chatting with you.
 Nope, which one?
 Sounds interesting. We should try it sometime.
 Sounds good!
 No, I don't think so. What is it like?
 Hmm, I'm not sure about that. I think I'll stick to my usual favorites.
 No, not really. I find it too depressing most of the time.
 I didn't, actually. That does sound interesting.
 Just going to hang out with some friends, maybe catch a movie. What about you?
 Sounds like a good, relaxing weekend.
 All right. Take care!
 No, I'm not interested in sports.
 Yes, I love it!
 I can't choose just one, there are so many good options.
 Oh, really? I don't particularly like ginger.

 For several years now, I find it really helps me relax after a long day at work.
 I'd rather not talk about work right now, it's been a stressful week.
 Not really, just planning on staying in and relaxing.
 Nah, I'm not really into sports.
 Actually, I watched this really boring indie film last night.
 I'm into electronic and techno mostly. I was just at a great festival last month actually.
 Hmm, it's really hard to choose. But I've been listening to a lot of Chris Liebing lately.
 Definitely cats.
 I'm an accountant.
 Yeah, I can't complain. Anyway, I should probably head out now. Nice chatting with you though!
 Yeah, I watched one that was pretty good.
 I think it was called "Mindhunter" or something.
 Definitely. I love crime shows, and this one had a really unique twist to it.
 Hmm, I don't know if I can pick just one. Maybe "Breaking Bad"?
 Honestly, I wasn't a big fan. It felt a little too neat for a show that had been so gritty and unpredictable.
 Not really. I've been too busy with work to go to the movies.
 I work for an insurance company. It's pretty boring, to be honest.
 Not really. I'm probably just going to stay at home and relax.
 Thanks, you too!
 Not great, I woke up with a headache.
 Yeah, I took some aspirin, but it doesn't seem to be helping much.
 No, I don't think that's it.
 Honestly, I try not to pay attention to the news these days. It's all so negative.
 No, I can't say I have.
 Not really, I stick to what I know I like.
 Not really, I find sitting in a theater for that long to be uncomfortable.
 Not really, I don't have much time to read these days.

 It's just been busy with lots of deadlines. It's always like this at my job.
 Sorry, I'm not much of an outdoor person.
 Not really. I mostly just watch TV or play video games.
 Mostly just first-person shooter games. They're the only ones I really enjoy.
 Not really, to be honest. I'm not a huge movie person.
 No, not really. I find them pretty boring.
 I'm not a picky eater, but I mostly just eat fast food or takeout.
 No, not really. I stick with what I know.
 I'm not sure. I'm feeling pretty tired, actually. I might just head to bed soon.
 Yeah, actually I had a really great meal at this sushi place downtown.
 Yeah, I do. But actually, speaking of food, what do you think about the keto diet?
 Yeah, that makes sense. Hey, did you hear that new album by Tyler, the Creator? I've been really into it.
 Classic rock? Who's your favorite band?
 Yeah, I can definitely see that. But you know who I never really got into? The Beatles.
 I mean, I guess I can see why people would think that. So, uh, did you catch the game last night?
 Oh, that's cool. What are your other hobbies or interests?
 Oh, that's really nice. What kind of dog do you have?
 Aw, that's awesome. Well, I should probably get going. It was nice talking to you.
 Yeah, I have.
 I have a vague idea. But I'm not really interested in it.
 I guess that's cool if you're into that kind of thing.
 Yeah, I love movies. What's your favorite movie?
 Yeah, I have. That's a great movie.
 I hate them. I can't stand all the gore and jump scares.
 I like a little bit of everything, but I've been really into indie rock lately.
 Not really a fan of jazz, to be honest.
 Not really. I don't have much interest in sports.

 Honestly, I don't really like hiking.
 Yes, I love Italian cuisine.
 No, I don't really cook.
 Not really, my job takes up most of my time.
 No, unfortunately, I've been pretty busy.
 Oh, well that does sound nice.
 It’s going okay.
 No, I haven’t.
 Yes, I have.
 Honestly, I didn't find it very interesting.
 Not really. I'll probably just stay home and watch some movies.
 Yeah, I'm planning to watch the new James Bond movie.

 Yes, I love reading. What genre do you like the most?
 Yes, Agatha Christie. Have you ever read any of her books?
 I love action movies. How about you?
 Yes, "Die Hard" starring Bruce Willis. It is a classic action movie. Have you seen it?
 I'm not really into sports. How about you?
 I prefer playing games. Watching sports isn't really my thing.
 Yeah, I just watched Stranger Things.
 Yeah, I'm a big fan. What's your favorite sci-fi movie?
 Oh, I haven't seen that one in ages. Do you like action movies too?
 Hmm, I haven't seen that one yet. By the way, have you heard back from that job you applied for?
 Sorry, I shouldn't have brought it up. So, um, do you like sports at all?
 Yeah, I don't really care for them either. Oh, hey, did you ever finish that book you were reading?
 No, I'm not really into sports.
 Nothing much, just planning to catch up on some reading.
 Sure, I'm reading "Sapiens" by Yuval Noah Harari at the moment. Would highly recommend it.
 It's an exploration of the history of humankind from the emergence of Homo sapiens to the present day.
 None, actually.
 That's not really my thing, but thanks for the suggestion.
 Honestly, I'm not really a movie person.
 I enjoy hiking and camping.
 Sorry, gotta go! Talk to you later.
 Yes, I did.
 It's not worth it.
 It's not much different from the previous version. Plus, it doesn't come with a charger.
 No, I haven't.
 Maybe.
 No, I haven't.
 Yeah, not interested.
 I don't really care about politics.
 I know, but I still don't want to talk about it.
 Sure! My favorite show is Breaking Bad.
 No, I haven't. Is it as good as Breaking Bad?
 Okay, maybe I'll give it a try.
 Bye!
 Not really, I try to avoid the negativity.
 That's really cool! I've heard a lot about colonizing Mars.
 A little, more into technology than science.
 Actually, I'm using the Google Pixel which I think is better.
 Not really, I stick to my usual ones.
 Not really, I'm not into sports.
 Sorry, I didn't. Like I said, I'm not really into sports.
 I recently watched "La La Land" and it was really good!
 Not really, just that one because it was really well done.
 I like playing video games and reading books.
 Mostly first-person shooters, like Call of Duty.
 Yeah, it's definitely not for everyone. Anyway, I've got to go. Talk to you later!
 No, I'm not really into cooking.
 Actually, I've been working out for about 30 minutes every day. It's great.

 No, I'm not really into sci-fi movies.
 Yeah, I love Taylor Swift. Do you like her?

 I mainly like comedies, but I also enjoy some crime dramas.
 I would say Kevin Hart.
 Mostly pop and hip hop.
 Not really, I just listen to whatever's popular.

 Well, I guess we have different tastes. Maybe we can talk about something else?
 Not really, I'm not very interested in cosmetics.
 Sorry, but I'm not interested in that either. Let's talk about something else, okay?
 Not really, I don't like crowds. They make me feel anxious.

 Actually, that's something I do like. I'd love to travel more, especially to Asia.
 Yeah, I started watching this new crime drama. Not really my thing though.
 Honestly, I don't really watch TV that much.
 Yeah, I'm always up for a good movie.
 No, I don't really like horror movies. They freak me out.
 They're alright, I guess. Nothing special.
 I like playing video games and going for runs. How about you?
 Mostly first-person shooters and RPGs. Ever played either of those?
 I get that. FPS games can be pretty intense. Hey, I just remembered I have to make a phone call. See you later!
 Not much really, just watched some TV.
 Not really, just some crime show. It was kind of average.
 Me neither, but I was bored.
 Not really, I went to visit my family last month.

 Definitely getting to travel and meet new people.
 Probably Tokyo. The culture and food there is amazing.
 A little bit, but most people speak English as well. Only a few times have I been completely lost in translation.
 No, unfortunately not. I always regret not taking Spanish in high school.
 Not really, I was never much of an athlete. But I did enjoy music class.
 Honestly, I don't really listen to music much anymore. I know, it's kind of weird.
 To be honest, I've mostly just been rewatching Friends on Netflix.

 Yes, I saw it.
 Definitely.
 No, I haven't.
 I'm not that interested in TV shows right now, sorry.

 I enjoy watching action movies.
 No, I haven't.
 Not really, I find them boring.
 Yes, that's true. By the way, have you read any good books lately?

 I'm not sure, maybe just a lazy weekend at home.
 Nope, I haven't had the time.
 Not really, I find most TV shows boring.
 No, I'm not really into sports.
 No, not really.
 Not really, I'm not into sports.
 I just finished watching Breaking Bad for the fourth time. It's my all-time favorite.
 You should definitely give it a try, it's fantastic. Speaking of TV shows, have you seen The Witcher?
 I couldn't get into it, I don't know why. Have you seen Stranger Things?
 Exactly my thoughts, I stopped watching it after the second season. Hey, do you like politics?
 Yeah, I'm a big fan of Assassin's Creed.
 Oh yeah, those games are great too. Do you like horror movies?
 No, I haven't.
 Hmm, I don't think I'm interested in AI.
 Not really, I'm not a big sports fan.

 No, I haven't been keeping up with any TV shows lately.
 Yeah, I'll check it out if I have time.

 Oh, I'm not really a fan of vegan food.
 I prefer my meat.
 No, I haven't had much time lately to watch anything.
 Maybe, we'll see.
 Not yet, I'm still thinking about it. Any suggestions?
 Hawaii is too expensive. I don't think I can afford it right now.
 I've been to Florida before. It's not that interesting to me.

 Thanks, I hope so too. It was nice talking to you, but I have to go now.

 Mostly non-fiction books.
 Not really.

 No, I haven't. But honestly, I'm not really interested in doing so.
 Yeah, sounds good. Talk to you later.

 Ugh, please don't talk about gyms. They're so boring.
 I haven't heard anything about it. What's it called?
 That doesn't sound very interesting to me. I prefer sci-fi shows.
 Okay, well, what about books? Do you like reading?

 I like drama and thriller shows, like Breaking Bad or Ozark.
 They're really great, you should definitely watch them sometime.
 Yeah, no problem. Have a good one.
 Ugh, I try to avoid that topic. Taxes bore me to death.
 Definitely! I just finished watching Breaking Bad.
 I think he was a really complex character, but ultimately selfish and unlikable.
 Yeah, I think it's because we see him as an underdog at first, and his descent into darkness is gradual. Speaking of underdogs, did you hear about the latest little league upset?
 Honestly, probably not. It's just a small story that won't have any long-lasting impact. So, what hobbies have you picked up since quarantine began?
 That's cool. I've always liked the idea of gardening, but I don't have a green thumb. Do you have any tips?
 No, I have been trying to avoid junk food lately.
 That sounds great! I have been meaning to get some exercise.
 Not really my thing, to be honest.

 Sorry, I am not too interested in startups these days.
 Not really, I never understood the craze for sports on TV.

 No, I haven't. I'm not a big fan of sushi.
 I enjoy Italian food.
 No, I haven't. Is it any good?
 Not really. I prefer pasta dishes.

 No, I haven't.
 I'm really into crime dramas.
 Yeah, I have.
 Yeah, it's shot really well, but some parts can be pretty dark.
 No, I haven't.
 Hmm, I don't know if that's really my thing. I tend to prefer more upbeat stuff.
 Oh yeah, definitely. I love exploring new places.
 No, I haven't. But I've always wanted to go.
 It's a fruit that's really popular in Southeast Asia, but it's got a really strong odor that turns a lot of people off.
 No, I haven't heard about it.
 Oh, I'm not really interested in vegan food.
 I'm not a fan of avocado.

 No, I haven't. What's it called?
 Honestly, I'm not a big fan of pasta.
 Yeah, I don't really like eating salads either.
 Yeah, I watched "A Quiet Place Part II" last week. It was pretty good.
 Not really. It's more of a sci-fi thriller type of movie. Definitely worth watching, though.
 Not really, I find it quite boring.
 Not really. I've just been working a lot.
 Actually, no. I'm not a big fan of the beach. It's too hot and sandy.
 No, I haven't. Hiking sounds like a lot of work.
 (Thinking for a second) Well, I like playing video games.
 Mostly first-person shooters like Call of Duty or Battlefield.
 Why not? You should definitely start playing again.
 Sure, sounds good. See you later.
 Not really, I find it too overwhelming.

 Not really. I'm not much of a reader.
 I actually find it really boring.
 I'm sorry but I'm really not into that kind of music.
 Oh no, I really don't want to talk about that. It just stresses me out.
 To be honest, I'm pretty boring. I mainly like to stay at home and watch Netflix.
 Yeah, I caught the score this morning.
 I'm not really into football, honestly.
 Actually, I haven't been to any shows in a while. But I did just discover this new jazz artist I really like.
 Her name is Cécile McLorin Salvant, have you heard of her?
 Not really, I've just been sticking close to home lately.

 Not really, I am more of a couch potato.
 I don't watch much TV.
 Sorry, I don't like reading books either.

 Hmm. Not really my favorite period.
 I prefer street art and graffiti.

 No, I haven't. What's it called?
 Hmm, I might have to check it out sometime.
 Ew, no way. I don't even like seafood.
 Not really. I'm not a big fan of sports.
 Honestly, I mostly just like to read and watch movies.
 Not really. I've just been re-reading old favorites.
 Yeah, same to you. See you later.
 I'm okay, just feeling a little tired.
 No, I think I'm getting enough sleep.

 Yeah, I watched a few episodes of a crime drama.
 I don't really have a favorite.

 It was fine.
 Not really. Just caught up on some sleep.
 Not yet.
 Sure. Where do you want to go?

 I'm not picky. I'll eat just about anything.

 I don't really watch any sports.
 I don't watch a lot of TV.
 I just don't really have the time for it.

 That sounds boring. Plus, I don't really want to think about all that stuff right now.
 Nope, I've mostly just been staying home.
 No, I don't watch the news.
 I feel overwhelmed by all the negativity in the news nowadays.
 Yeah, I'm a big fan of basketball.
 The Lakers.
 Oof, let's talk about something else.
 Sure, I like action movies.
 No, I'm not a big fan of Bond films.
 Concerts can be fun, but I prefer staying in and listening to music on my own.
 Yeah, it was good chatting for a bit.
 No, I don't really care about basketball.
 Yeah, I went there last week. The burger was good, but the service was terrible.
 No, I haven't had time to watch the news lately. Is everyone alright?
 Yes, I went there for a vacation a few years ago. It was beautiful, but quite expensive.
 Not really, I'm not really into outdoor activities.
 Hmm, I don't think I've heard of that one. I'm not really into indie films.
 Ugh, don't remind me. I still haven't finished them.
 No, I haven't been there yet. What dishes would you recommend?
 Sounds delicious! I'll definitely have to check it out soon.
 Not really, I've been so busy with work. Plus, I'm not much of a reader.
 Not really, I just work a lot. What about you?
 That sounds nice, but I don't really have the energy for that kind of stuff.

 Yeah, you too. Talk to you later!
 No, I haven't watched any episode of that.
 Not really, I'm not into movies these days.
 Yeah, I'm a big bookworm! Any recommendations?
 Of course, that's one of my favorites!
 Actually, I didn't really like that book.
 I don't know, it just didn't really resonate with me.
 Not yet, what's it called?
 Oh, nice. I'm not a big fan of sushi, though.
 Hmm, I'm trying to cut down on carbs right now. Do they have any protein-heavy dishes?
 Sounds boring. You know what's not boring? The new video game I've been playing.
 That's cool. Have you been keeping up with the latest news though? I heard there's a new vaccine that's been approved.
 I know, right? I can't wait to travel again. What's your favorite travel destination?
 Ah, Japan. Yeah, it's a beautiful country, but it's pretty pricey.
 Oh god, don't even get me started on that. I'm trying to ignore it altogether.
 Yeah, same to you. See you later.
 Good, thanks.
 Yeah, I'm really into basketball.
 I'm a huge fan of the Lakers. LeBron James is the best!
 Yeah, I went to a game last year and it was awesome.
 Yeah, you should definitely go if you get the chance. So, do you like any TV shows?
 Oh, okay. What's your favorite movie then?
 Yeah, I have. It's a great movie. But to be honest, I don't really watch movies that much. I prefer playing video games.
 Mostly action games like Call of Duty and Battlefield. What about you?
 Oh, okay. Well, speaking of boring topics, do you have any interest in politics?
 Yeah, I know what you mean. It's all just a big mess. Well, I should probably get going. Nice talking to you!
 No, I'm not into horror games.
 Mostly racing games and simulation games.
 Yeah, those are all right.
 Not really. I've been too busy with work to have any time to read.
 Ugh, don't even get me started. Work's been really stressful lately.
 Yeah, see you.
 Not really, I'm not a big fan of live music.
 Yeah, I'm really into this sci-fi show on Netflix called "Dark".
 Definitely, if you're into time travel and complex storylines.
 Not really, I find sci-fi to be a bit boring.
 I enjoy comedies and action movies, but I can't stand horror films.
 Not really, I don't follow them much.
 I'm really into hiking and exploring nature.
 Yeah, there's this trail near my place that leads to a scenic waterfall. It's really beautiful.
 No, I haven't. What's so special about it?
 Sorry, I'm not much of a coffee person.
 Sounds good to me. Do you have a specific movie in mind?
 Absolutely! Let's book the tickets now. How about we go for the late night show?
 Actually, I have to pass. I'm not feeling well today. Maybe we can plan this some other day?
 Thanks, I appreciate your concern. See you later!
 Yeah, I've been there.
 Honestly, I don't really like it. The coffee wasn't great.
 Not really. I prefer tea.
 Mostly green tea or herbal teas. They're good for you.

 Absolutely, I love Star Wars!
 Darth Vader, hands down!
 Yeah, it was an okay movie. Nothing amazing, though.
 I'm not really into movies, to be honest.
 I like pretty much all types of music, except for country. I can't stand country music.
 I really like Coldplay.
 No, never. I'm not really interested in live music or concerts.
 No, I haven't. What's it called?
 Sounds interesting. I might check it out sometime.
 I'm a big fan of Italian food. Specifically, I love pizza and pasta.
 Eh, I'm not really a fan of raw fish. But have you heard about the new tax laws? They just passed a bill last month.
 Yeah, I'm really into crime dramas. I've been watching a lot of Law and Order lately.
 Yeah, I watched a few episodes years ago, but it never really hooked me. Hey, looks like my boss is calling. I gotta take this. Talk to you later.
 No, I haven't.
 Oh, I don't really like Indian food.
 I'm more of a burger and fries kind of person, to be honest.
 Not really. I feel like everything that's come out lately has been pretty disappointing.
 I'm not really picky, honestly. But I guess I prefer action and adventure.
 Yeah, but they're usually too slow and boring for me.
 I listen to a little bit of everything, but I'm not really into classical or jazz.
 It just puts me to sleep, honestly. But to each their own, I guess.
 You too.
 Actually, I don't like sushi.
 Italian food is okay, but I'm not a huge fan.
 I love Mexican food, especially tacos.
 No, I haven't. Is it any good?
 Thanks for the recommendation. Actually, have you heard about the new policy changes at work? It's been getting on my nerves.
 It's just a bunch of new rules they're implementing. I don't want to get into it. So, do you have any hobbies?
 I don't really have any hobbies. I just work all the time.
 I suppose so, but I just don't have the time. Oh, it looks like I have to go. Talk to you later.
 Not really, I don't watch movies that much.
 Yeah, I've been bingeing on The Office.
 Definitely Dwight. He's so hilarious.
 No, I haven't. I'm not really into comedy.
 Oh, that's cool. How do you usually spend your weekends?
 Same here. Been trying to finish a book for the past few weekends.
 Mostly non-fiction. How about you?
 Not really. I don't get too much time to read these days.
 Yes, I've been to a few places in Europe.
 France, Spain and Italy. It was great.
 Not really, I'm not much of a reader.
 Sounds boring to me.
 I'm really into sports, mostly basketball.
 Yeah, I'm a big Lakers fan.
 Yeah, but I don't think it's going to be enough to win the championship.
 Speaking of tough, I'm swamped at work right now. It's been really stressful lately.
 I'm an accountant. It's pretty boring stuff.
 Not really, just planning on taking it easy and catching up on some sleep.
 I used to, but I haven't really been into anything lately.
 Not much, just hanging out.
 Not really, I try to avoid the news as much as possible.
 Yeah, I've been playing a lot of video games lately.
 Mostly first-person shooters, and some RPGs occasionally.
 Not really, I'm not that into sports.
 I recently watched "Parasite," it was really good.
 Just the storytelling, the cinematography, and the underlying social commentary.
 Oh, let's not get into politics, it's just so divisive.
 Nope, I'm an only child.
 No, I'm not into sports.
 Yeah, I saw the new Tarantino movie. It was pretty great.
 Definitely. It's a bit slow at times, but the acting is superb.
 Actually, I've been watching this show about the history of the potato. It's surprisingly fascinating.
 I'm really into vaporwave lately. It's this kind of experimental electronic music with a lot of old samples.
 No, I don't play anything.
 Not really, to be honest. I mostly just work and watch stuff.
 I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm happy with my life the way it is. Thanks though.
 Same to you! Thanks for the conversation.
 Actually, yes. I saw Post Malone a few weeks ago.
 It was amazing. His stage presence is just unstoppable.
 Actually, I haven't been keeping up with new music much.
 Not really, I've just been too busy with work to watch much of anything.
 I'm an accountant. It's not the most exciting job, but it pays the bills.
 Honestly, I like to just relax at home with a good book or video game.
 Mostly just shooters and sports games. Nothing too complicated.
 Yeah, you too.
 I haven't tried it yet, but I've heard good things about it.
 I see. I actually prefer coffee over tea because of the caffeine kick!
 No, I haven't. Is it any good?
 Yeah, maybe. Listen, I actually have to go now.
 Just running some errands. It's not really that interesting.
 To be honest, it was boring.
 No, I didn't do anything. Just stayed at home all weekend.
 I guess that's one way to look at it. But it was still pretty boring.
 No, I didn't even want to do that. Just wasn't in the mood.
 Yeah, I hope so. Anyways, how was your weekend?
 That sounds like fun. Who did you see?
 Oh, I love them! What's your favorite song by them?
 Yeah, that's a great one. I think my favorite is "Everlong."

 Ugh, I try not to pay attention to that kind of stuff.
 Not really, I don't watch movies that often.
 Oh, I'm really into hiking and nature photography.
 No, I haven't, but it sounds pretty boring to me.
 Honestly, I don't care about music that much.
 It was pretty average, nothing exciting happened.
 Thanks, me too. Alright, I gotta go now. Talk to you later.
 Not much, just watched some TV.
 I caught up on some documentaries.
 I find them interesting. What about you? What kind of things do you like to watch on TV?
 Oh, that's alright. What do you like to do in your free time?
 Sounds nice. What kind of books do you like to read?
 Interesting. I haven't read a biography in a while. Do you have any recommendations?
 It's alright. How about we switch gears? Are you into sports at all?
 Fair enough. How about movies? Do you like any particular genres?
 Oh, I'm not really into sci-fi. I find it kind of boring.
 Same to you. Have a good day!
 No, I haven't. What kind of food do they serve?
 I love Italian food, especially pizza. Speaking of pizza, have you tried the new pizza place that just opened nearby?
 It's not bad, but I think it's a bit overhyped.
 No, I haven't had a chance to watch it yet. Which movie are you talking about?
 I don't really like horror movies. I find them too scary.
 Nah, I'm not much of a gamer.
 I'm actually in the middle of a book right now. It's a murder mystery novel.
 It's by Agatha Christie. Have you read any of her books?
 Not really, I try to avoid that kind of stuff.
 It was nice chatting with you too. See you around.
 It's been really busy, we're launching a new product soon.
 It's a new software application.
 No, I haven't.
 No, I haven't.
 Hmm, that's kind of cool.
 Not really, I'm not much of a cook.
 Not really, I'm pretty picky when it comes to what I eat.
 Not really, I don't watch a lot of TV.
 Thanks, you too.
 Oh yeah, I've heard good things but I'm trying to cut back on pasta, so I probably won't be checking it out.
 To be honest, I'm not too picky. I like trying new things but I generally prefer lighter foods, like salads or fish.
 Honestly, not really. I find most restaurants kind of overpriced and underwhelming.
 Not really, I'm not much of a sports fan.
 Mostly just hanging at home, watching movies or TV. I also like to read sometimes.
 Honestly, it was just some boring memoir for a book club. I didn't really get into it.
 Um, no, I haven't really been watching much TV lately.
 Actually, yes, I just finished a really great novel last week.
 "The Nightingale" by Kristin Hannah.
 No, I haven't.
 Actually, I'm not really in the mood for eating out right now.
 Not really, no. I haven't had much time to go to the movies lately.

 I stayed at home, watched some TV.
 Not really, just some crime shows.

 No, I haven't. I'm not much of a traveler. I prefer staying close to home.
 Not really. I'm just going to hang out with some friends.
 No, I hate hiking. It's too much effort for too little payoff.
 Sorry, I don't care about trendy diets. I eat what I want.
 Honestly, I don't really have a favorite. I like different kinds of food depending on my mood.
 Not really, no. I don't like crowded places.
 Yeah, I saw it last weekend. It was pretty good.
 Probably Han Solo.
 Not really, I don't keep up with the latest phones.
 Yeah, I just finished watching The Boys. It's a really good show.
 No, I'm not really interested in that. Seems too dangerous to me.
 I mainly just watch movies and TV shows when I have free time.
 No, cooking and baking are not really my thing.
 Yes, I've seen all of them.
 Definitely Han Solo.
 No, I haven't.
 Sorry, I don't eat seafood.
 I'm not really into art.
 It's been alright, just a typical day at work.
 That sounds pretty boring to be honest.
 You too.
 No, not yet. How was it?
 I'm not really into Italian, do they serve any other cuisine?
 That's more like it. What's your favorite Japanese dish?
 I'm not a big fan of sushi, but I love tempura!
 Nope, never heard of it. What is that?
 Ahh, I see. I don't really care about healthy food, though. Do you follow any sports teams?
 Ugh, baseball is super boring. I prefer soccer or basketball. By the way, I need to go to the bank. It was nice chatting with you.
 Yes, I have it on my watchlist but did not get the chance to watch it yet.
 I will. By the way, have you heard the news about the upcoming Apple product launch?
 The rumors say it's going to be a foldable iPhone.
 Yes, let's hope they don't disappoint us like they did with the latest iPhone release.
 Oh, Samsung is not any less disappointing, if you ask me.
 Not really, I find them boring.
 Yes, I like photography and reading books.
 Mostly science fiction and fantasy.
 No, I haven't actually.
 Sure, I will check it out. Thanks for the suggestion.
 It’s been a tough day at work.
 I work in a call center.
 No, but it pays the bills.
 No, I usually just cook at home.
 Not really. It’s not my thing.
 Not really, I don’t have much free time.
 I usually just watch TV.
 Mostly crime dramas.
 No, I'm not really into movies.
 No, I'm not really into sports either.
 Sure, take care.
 Yeah, I watched it last weekend.
 I thought it was pretty good. I liked the retro 80s vibe.
 Not really, to be honest.
 I'm mostly into electronic and dance music.
 Oh really? I don't really enjoy that kind of music.
 Definitely. So, do you like sports at all?
 Yeah, I feel you. What do you usually do for fun then?
 Nice. I don't play video games much myself, but I like to read too.
 Yeah, it was nice talking with you too. Take care!
 Yeah, I did. It's pretty concerning.
 Yup, I got vaccinated last month.
 How about we talk about something else?
 Well, I enjoy hiking and camping.
 I love hiking Mount Rainier, the scenery is breathtaking.
 Ugh, I really don't want to talk about taxes.
 Another depressing topic. Let's talk about something more uplifting, like art.
 I love street art, the creativity and skill required to make it is amazing.
 Not yet, but I plan to go to some soon.
 Not much, just trying to keep myself busy.
 Not really, I find it hard to get motivated sometimes.
 Yeah, I feel the same way.
 Not really, I haven't found anything that's really grabbed my attention recently.
 Not really, I mostly just listen to the same stuff over and over again.
 Honestly, it wasn't that great. The food was really bland.
 No, I haven't really had the time or money to plan a trip.
 Definitely. Well, I've got to run. Talk to you later.
 No, I haven't. Which one are you talking about?
 Oh, I've heard of it. But honestly, I'm not much of a foodie.
 I'm really into art, particularly abstract expressionism.
 Yes, I love going to the MoMA. Have you been to any art exhibitions recently?
 Actually, I just saw Hamilton on Broadway. It was amazing. Have you seen it?
 You should definitely try to see it. Oh, and speaking of music, have you heard of this new band called The Muted?
 They play indie rock, which is my favorite genre. But you might not like it if you're not into rock music.
 Yeah, that's true. Hey, I gotta run now. It was nice talking to you.
 Yeah, I just finished "Stranger Things." I thought it was amazing.
 To be honest, I think it was just the nostalgia factor. It reminded me of the 80s, and I loved that.
 Yeah, I just discovered this indie band called Tame Impala. Really digging their sound.
 Currently, it's "The Less I Know The Better." Such a catchy tune.
 Not really, I've been pretty disappointed by all the recent movies.
 Exactly. It's like nobody in Hollywood has any original ideas anymore.
 No, sorry, I haven't really had time to read lately.
 Not really. Honestly, I just eat at home most of the time.
 No, I'm not really into sports.
 You too.
 Nope, I haven't.
 That sounds interesting. I usually enjoy seafood.
 Ah, I see. I don't really like spending too much on food, to be honest.
 Actually, no. I haven't had much time for that.
 Hmm... I'm not really into crime shows.
 Not really, to be honest. I don't really enjoy working out.
 I'll take your word for it! Haha. Actually, it was nice chatting with you, but I gotta run.
 No, I haven't. Is it any good?
 I love pizza! What other toppings do they have?
 Yummy! I'm a big fan of bacon.
 Yes, actually, I make it all the time at home. It's really easy!
 Not really, to be honest. I don't like talking about politics.
 I listen to a lot of different genres, but I'm really into indie rock right now. What about you?
 No way! I'm way too scared of heights.
 No, I haven't gone anywhere lately. I'm still trying to save up for a big trip next year.
 Yeah, actually, I have. It was a total disaster. I don't like talking about it though.
 Not really, I've been saving money. JSON is too verbose, isn't it?
 I manage a technical team, but I don't enjoy it much. Do you enjoy your work?
 Honestly, not really. I prefer to listen to music in my headphones.
 I like to read, but lately, it's just been work, sleep, and repeat.
 Once or twice, but I don't really see the point.
 Honestly, I just like to binge-watch Netflix. Right now, I'm hooked on this new show.
 It's called "The Haunting of Bly Manor." It's a horror series, and it's really good.
 Yeah, you too. Bye.
 No, I haven't.
 Oh, nice. I love coffee.
 That sounds awesome. I'll have to check it out sometime.
 Not really, I've been really busy.
 Not really. Just going to work and coming back home.
 Yeah, maybe. But not sure what yet.
 I don't really like heights, but maybe I'll consider it.
 Yes, I just finished watching Game of Thrones.
 Well, it's a personal opinion, but I think it's amazing.
 Hmm, well, everyone has different tastes. So, what kind of shows do you usually watch?
 Oh, those are classic. But have you tried watching The Office? It's hilarious.
 Have you read any good books lately?
 Oh, that's okay. Do you like video games?
 Alright, that's fine. How was your day today?
 Oh, well, hope tomorrow's better. Speaking of which, I should probably head out now. Goodnight!
 It was okay. I didn't do much.
 Just watched TV at home.
 Sorry, I haven't seen that show. I watched the news and it was depressing.
 No, I haven't. I'm not really that interested in trying new places.
 Not really, I'm not that into sports.
 Travel is not really my thing. I'd rather stay at home.
 Not really. It was nice chatting with you though.
 Not really, I find it boring.
 Well, I do like Italian food.
 No, I haven't. I've never been outside of the country actually.
 Oh, that sounds interesting. What did you do there?
 I might consider it one day. What do you think about politics?
 I totally get it. How about sports? Do you like any sport in particular?
 Yeah, the Lakers have lots of fans. But I don't follow sports at all.
 Yeah, I like pets. But I'm allergic to dogs.
 Not really, I find it too depressing.
 No, I can't say that I have.
 That does sound interesting, I'll have to look into it.
 No, travelling isn't really my thing.
 Not really, I prefer listening to music at home.
 Yeah, I like to paint and draw in my free time.
 Mostly landscapes and portraits, I find it really relaxing.
 No, I don't enjoy hiking very much.
 I like playing basketball with my friends.
 Probably LeBron James.
 I don't know, it's hard to say.
 Not really, to be honest.
 I have a cat named Mittens.
 Not really, I'm more of a cat person.
 No, I'm not a big fan of Indian food.
 I really love Italian food, especially pizza.
 No, I haven't, but I'd love to go someday.
 Yeah, you too, take care!
 No, but I really want to. What did you like most about it?
 I don't really like sweet things. Do you?
 Honestly, I'm not really into food that much. I eat to survive.
 Not really. I don't really like movies. I find them quite boring, to be honest.
 I don't watch TV either. I think it's a waste of time.
 I hate reading. Reading is so boring.
 I don't really have any hobbies. I just work and sleep. Life is pretty dull, you know?
 No plans. Just going to stay home and relax. I don't feel like doing anything.
 It was good. I had a productive workday.
 I work in sales.
 Not really, it's quite stressful.
 Yes, I enjoy playing video games and watching movies.
 I really like playing FIFA. Would you like to play with me sometime?
 Yeah, I'm into action and adventure movies.
 Not really, I haven't had much time to watch movies lately.

 Yeah, I just started watching a new drama series on Netflix.
 It's called "Ozark".
 Not really, I haven't been to the cinema in a while.
 I don't really have a favorite genre.
 Not really, sorry.
 Nope, just been staying home mostly.
 No, I haven't.
 It was okay.
 Just ran some errands and did some cleaning. How about you?
 That's cool. I've been wanting to try out some new bars in the area.
 Yeah, I feel that. Saving money is important.
 Not really. I'm not great at that stuff.
 Yeah, I just saw the latest horror movie in theaters. It was really scary.
 Okay. Well, what do you like to watch?
 Really? I don't really like those. I find them kind of predictable.
 Not really. I just listen to whatever's on the radio.
 Not really, I'm pretty set in my ways.
 Okay, well it was nice talking to you. See you later.
 Oh, that sounds interesting.
 Not really, but I've heard of the Schrodinger's cat experiment.
 Hmm, I think I need to read more about this. Anyway, have you seen the new Christopher Nolan movie?
 Oh, it's just a typical Nolan movie with time loops and vague philosophical concepts. I didn't like it that much.
 No, I don't really follow basketball. I prefer soccer.
 Yeah, I support Manchester United. What about you?
 Yes, I play the guitar. I've been practicing for years.
 Yeah, learning an instrument can be time-consuming, but it's really rewarding. Well, I have to go now. Nice talking to you!
 I'm doing good.
 No, I'm not really into sci-fi movies.
 Sometimes, but not always.
 Honestly, I don't really have one.
 I mostly just watch TV or play video games.
 Yeah, I've been playing a lot of Fortnite. It's really addictive.
 Not really. I've tried playing PUBG but I didn't really enjoy it.
 I'm not really into music, to be honest.
 No, I find them kind of boring.
 I mostly just like to hang out with my friends and chat.
 It was pretty uneventful.
 Actually, I watched one the other day. It was called "The Shawshank Redemption". It's a great movie.
 It's about a man who is wrongfully convicted of murder and is sentenced to life in prison. It's a story of hope and redemption.
 Well, I like action movies. Have you seen John Wick?
 I like Tom Cruise. He's been in some great movies like Top Gun and Mission Impossible.
 No, I haven't had time to travel recently.
 Maybe I will. Hey, look at the time, I should get going. It was nice talking to you.
 No, I haven't.
 Hmm, that sounds good. I am always up for trying out new places.
 It was pretty uneventful. Just stayed at home and watched some movies.
 Not really. Just some old classics.
 Tom Hanks is a great actor, but I am not interested in watching movies now.
 Not interested.
 Sorry, not interested in politics either.
 Perfect!
 Yeah, I love reading.
 I'm into mystery and suspense novels.
 Yes, I have. It was a bit overrated in my opinion.
 Not really, I'm not really a sports person.
 Yeah, I play sometimes.
 Mostly first-person shooters, but I also like adventure games.
 Alright, see you later.
 No, what's it called?
 Oh, I'm not a big fan of Indian food.
 Yeah, I'm not much of a chicken person either.
 Actually, I love sushi. What's your favorite sushi roll?
 I usually get the California roll or the dragon roll.
 Not really, I don't have much time for movies these days.
 Yeah, I just finished watching Breaking Bad. It was amazing.
 No, I heard it's good but I haven't gotten around to watching it yet.
 Not really, I don't have time for that either.
 Hi, it's going well.
 Hmm not really, I'm more of a music person.
 Mostly indie rock and pop. What about you?
 Hmm, I've never really been into classical music. How about movies?
 Oh, I can't really get into those. I prefer action movies.
 Honestly, I'm not really into diets. I prefer to just eat what I want in moderation.
 It's been pretty mild lately. Not too hot, but not too cold either.
 You too, bye!
