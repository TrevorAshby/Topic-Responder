In most games there is only 11 minutes of live game play anyway, that game must have had a lot more.\n", "bleu": 0.11802504952256235, "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.15, "rouge2": 0.0, "rougeL": 0.15, "rougeLsum": 0.15}, "unieval": [{"naturalness": 0.9995998190644879, "coherence": 0.18845896478526084, "engagingness": 0.6931375017374907, "groundedness": 0.23593332178188225, "understandability": 0.9995379691423523, "overall": 0.6233335153022947}]}, "b3(vicuna)": {"generated": "person2:i have a horse farm and i love it . person1:i have a dog and a cat , they are very cute", "bleu": 0.1567013346796607, "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.25000000000000006, "rouge2": 0.0, "rougeL": 0.25000000000000006, "rougeLsum": 0.25000000000000006}, "unieval": [{"naturalness": 0.9415685498839106, "coherence": 0.41230816080694405, "engagingness": 1.9656701109199994, "groundedness": 0.7284144719880168, "understandability": 0.9281460277644509, "overall": 0.9952214642726643}]}, "b4(chatgpt)": {"generated": "person2:That's great that you enjoy your job at the grocery store.
