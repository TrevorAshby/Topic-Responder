Creatures of the great deep are extraordinary. \"The immortal Jelly fish.  person2:I already looked up that jellyfish on my phone. Fascinating, yes loch ness is protected and pets in Boulder, Colorado are not owned, but guarded. Interesting how different cultures handle that. person1:Tell me about it apparently there are more U.S. Tigers living as pets than there are living in the wild in Asia. person2:Yes, that is sad in some ways too. Happy we\\'re keeping them alive, probably in zoo but going extinct in the wild is a sad statement on the planet today. person1:I agree. Germany became the first country to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed rights.   person2:While I\\'m a pet owner, that going a bit far. Do you give dogs and cats rights, how about those dairy cows or cattle to be eaten. Do they get lesser rights? person1:Very good point. My wife and I are watching Blue Planet. It\\'s shocking some of the things that are down in the deep. they are still making discoveries every single day. Apparently the sea horse is the only fish with a neck.  person2:Yes, and really they say we know more about the face of the moon than the bottom of the ocean. Who knows what\\'s down there we don\\'t know?  Maybe the Loch Ness monster\\'s cousin. person1:If you ever get a chance you should check this show, there\\'s some amazing creatures down there. 84% of genes that are associated with diseases have counterparts in the Zebrafish.  person2:I read that and thought the same. I wonder how similar the Zebra Fish is to humans? Can we use that in medical research? person1:If we can i\\'m sure it will be preventative or medication. There\\'s no money in cures. I didn\\'t realize that we had already cloned a cat and named it Copy Cat, that\\'s too funny. person2:Yes, the scientist in that experiment had a sense of humor. Related to domestication, I had no idea that domesticated animals develop a white patch on their foreheads. I wonder what causes that, it doesn\\'t seem to have any evolutionary reason to me. person1:Sounds strange. I can\\'t fathom why anyone would want a rat for a pet. I\\'m a little leery of guinea pigs and ferrets. anything with red eyes you can keep.   person2:Haha, yep. A snake doesn\\'t seem very warm or comforting either. I don\\'t understand why people enjoy having them as pets. And how do they find partners who accept it? person1:Other people who like that stuff i guess, haha. Apparently Theodore Roosevelt had 20 pets including a bear and Hyena. I wonder if he played with them much?  person2:Well, President of the United States, I wonder if he had them in the White House? Did he have a stable for the bear out back? person1:Some animals just should be domesticated. That white patch if true is something to ponder.  person2:Yes indeed, interesting facts that will give me pause this weekend. That was an enjoyable conversation. Thanks and have a lovely weekend. person1:You as well!!
