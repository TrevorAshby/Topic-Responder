I should have gone into the STEM field back in college. That's a factoid to add to my future discussions. ", "Yeah, I should've done that too and if my kids ever wanted to be professional cheerleaders, I would be very opposed to it especially since the Saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as the NFL players. They're humans too!", "That sounds like borderline discrimination but I guess they don't want the cheerleaders to influence the game. They must have had previous encounters of bad press.", "Yeah or gender bias too! Not sure, I didn't read about that in the news, at least not anytime recently, I'm surprised there's no MeToo campaign surround that rule!", "I guess it's only a #MeToo moment if they were touched. I doubt they were. I'm surprised that there's no female NFL players, since it is no written rule against this. ", "Good point, but there's something wrong with that rule. Yeah, but even if females can play, I'd imagine some would have a difficult time meeting the leagues physical eligibility requirements, I'm not sure what that is, do you know?", "I don't know. There are some muscular females out there in the world. Certain some of them can give people a run for their spot.", "Yeah, women can be aggressive and strategize as well! They even use tracking chips to monitor and record the players move on the field, I would love to see the data on that.", "I wonder if that's their attempt to bring statistics into the game, similar to how baseball is all a statistical game. Sounds like some 1950 harvard mathematic research team with the latest gadgets.", "Haha, that would be cool to track, like how fast a quarterback can throw a ball or the force at which someone tackles. I wonder if the player's contracts for salary are adjusted because they're either one of the fastest players or something.", "I doubt the franchise would even know what to do with this data. A lot of them are retired football players who just knows the old fashion game play and will probably never adopt new technology.", "Oh that's a good point.
