0,yes, I'm. a football fan.
1,Yes, I do.  I think they want to intimidate the visiting teams.
2,Yes, LOL. Do you know about ESPN winning an emmy?
3,Yes, what did they do the rest of the time?
4,I do.  They now make pennies compared to professional football players.
5,NFL or college football?
6,Cumberland was defeated by Georgia Tech. The scores were 222-0.  It was in 1916.
7,Yes.  I wonder why though.  Do you know why?
8,Green-Ellis, an RB, has never fumbled the ball in his NFL career.
9,No, I do not think so other wise I would have heard.
10,Yes, I do watch television once a day.  I like to watch national news.  I've got to run now.  Great chats!
11,Hello, I am doing great, you? Do you like football?
12,I love it also! That is interesting, I wonder how much more football players make now than bowlers
13,I agree lol. Did you know the first nfl playoff game was played in 1932 on an 80 yard field in chicago
14,Right! Now they even have chip technology in players should pads tracking data for them
15,I heard that before, that is a great feat! He needs to teach a clinic to these new era RBs on how to hold on to the ball!
16,for sure! I liked his name lol. Do you know the Lions coach Matt Patricia?
17,Yea the assistant, now coaches the Lions. The guy is a rocket scientist!
18,I was thinking the same thing. Do you watch college football at all?
19,That is true, I live down the street from that stadium. It is because pink has a natural calming effect on people who see it!
20,For sure, maybe why they are good at home for football. It was very nice chatting with you!
21,He actually own the Dallas Cowboys. Apparently he has been pushing for an 18 game season.
22,Ha ha. Troy Aikman disagrees with expanding the season by two games on account of the players health and he has many supporters with the recent research regarding brain health. I agree with Troy.
23,Injuries leading to brain damage over time. Jones has countered by saying they could shorten the pre-season by two games to even it out and it would be even safer. But I disagree with that because teams are more careful with their players in pre-season for fear of them being injured for the actual season when it counts.
24,True but they seem to be finding at least some degree of it in the majority of autopsies they have performed. Jones also cited more money as a reason to extend the season which I believe is his only real motivation. I find that upsetting when he has to have more money than he could possibly spend at this point. It's very greedy.
25,That's true. It seems to damage their impulse control. He says the players would make more but there is no guarantee of that and I don't think it's worth their health. They are already making a staggering amount of money.
26,I don't think it will either. Did you know that the average football game only has 11 minutes of actual live game play! I knew that they felt way too full of commercials and interruptions.
27,Yes, that is a prime advertising time. I do not like the way they treat their cheerleaders. Saints cheerleaders aren't even allowed to eat in the same restaurant as players and if a player enters and they are already eating, they have to stop eating and leave.
28,Not sure because i also recently found out that the cheerleaders make nearly minimum wage which is ridiculous. That's interesting. I know those were the height of entertainment at one point but I wonder if they hold up now.
29,That's pretty fascinating especially given the distance.
30,I know we have sent music into space just in case.
31,It's been a while since I heard the list but I know there is some classical in there.
32,Not really. I'm not into sports that much, but it's an interesting subject to me. Do you have a favorite team?
33,I guess recently discoveries have been made linking football to traumatic brain injury (obviously) but even worse, also degenerative brain disease and chronic encephalopathy! I'll be looking more into it, as I said, I'm interested :)
34,Absolutely! running back Larry Johnson is battling self destructive impulses and surely CTE. It seems unfair to me, to have a sport in which the players are suffering for the rest of their lives!
35,Shake my head! And I was just reading about it and found out that in the 60's top  bowlers made twice as much as top football stars! We should all just go back to bowling! It's much safer :)
36,Yeah that is amazing! I would think the average game play would be much longer. Hm. I wonder why! So, it's hard to believe women could play too, but they might not be as offended if they were playing against the university of Iowa who painted the visiting teams locker room pink! HA! Talk about good sportsmanship :)
37,No I didn't! I hope they put the chips in say the shoes or helmets versus implanting them in the players bodies! The very idea of tracking chips scares me!
38,Oh whew! Okay. that isn't sooo bad :) I wonder why the New Orleans Saints cheerleaders aren't allowed to eat at the same restaurant as any NFL player! I heard that if the cheerleader is eating at a restaurant and any player comes in, she has to leave! That's absurd!
39,Something tells me that being an engineer is much safer than being an NFL player. Hard to say which job would be more satisfying or more worthy of doing. Considering engineers get paid more, I'd go with that job!
40,Oh wow! If that is per year, I'd love to only work 4 months and 1 week a year. But I'm sure they have to practice and do other things, like media events throughout the year. So maybe I will look into being an engineer and put my football dreams behind me. Haha. Kidding of course :)
41,Thanks! Same to you! I hope you have a wonderful day!
42,Goodbye!
43,Hi there, I'm good thank you.  I love sports!  How about you?
44,I used to be really into basketball when I was growing up, I still watch my favorite team though.  Do you know what the highest grossing basketball movie ever was?
45,The top grossing basketball movie ever? It was Space Jam.  Did you hear there is another Space Jam in the works?
46,Yeah I think so, I think Lebron will be the star of the movie.
47,He sure does, I wonder if he is among the top grossing athletes around the world?
48,He is, and I don't think he will for another few years yet.  Do you follow the NFL at all?
49,Yeah I always watch the Super Bowl, I mostly follow my team.  The playoffs are always exciting as well.
50,I think I usually do the same.  Did you there is a high school football stadium in Texas that seats 18,000?
51,Yeah they love football down there, especially high school football, I think they take it very seriously.
52,I guess it cost $60 million to make, wow. Yeah same to you it was fun chatting.
53,Thank you, I hope you do too!
54,I am a big fan of the NFL, how about you?
55,It is sort of frustrating that there is so little actual gameplay. Sometimes it does not feel that way though.
56,I know a lot of players have short careers so they don't make as much as the elite players in the league.
57,I did not know that. I wonder if they think that will throw off the visiting team's performance?
58,I don't see that playing a factor with teams these days. I would like to hear an opposing school talk about it
59,I would imagine that being an engineer comes with a lot less health risks such as brain damage!
60,I know some of the Philadelphia Eagles had to have offseason jobs in the 60s. That's how Chuck Bednarik earned the nickname "Concrete Charlie", he sold concrete when the season was over.
61,I would be curious to know why bowlers were being paid so well then.
62,I think it's pretty crazy that some of these coaches get paid so much. The schools could use that for better purposes.
63,I know they bring a lot of revenue in for schools and you want the best candidates for the job, but other professors must feel real cheated by those salaries.
64,Yea I watch the nfl and a little college. I'm glad to see Danny Johnson made it onto the Redskins despite playing at Southern University
65,Yea, I guess Iowa was trying to psych out the visiting teams by painting the lockers pink
66,Yea, Espn won an emmy for it's coverage of the NFL, it's never won an emmy for its bowling coverage
67,Yea, it's too bad there was not tv when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0, I'd love to see highlights of that
68,Yea, I wonder how much live gameplay that game had since the NFL averages 11 minutes
69,Possibly, I wonder if a female player was on the Saints if she would not be allowed to be in the same public places as the male players like the cheerleaders are
70,Yea, the saints rules sounds really outdated and sexist
71,It's pretty interesting, I know in baseball people are making a big deal out of tracking ball speed and velocity
72,I guess so but it might be cool if they put chips in basketball, I'd love to know how much force Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's dunk had
73,Yea, I wonder I Jabbar ever coached, they are the highest paid employees in 39 of 50 states
74,Hey there. Yes I love football. I am sad that the NFL season is over.
75,Yeah I agree especially with only 11 minutes of average gameplay per game.
76,I think they should if they are good enough but they shouldn't if they are smart. It is such a brutal game. And they don't make all that much because of injuries.
77,Did you hear how the Saints cheerleaders can't interact with the players?
78,Yeah exactly. The NFL even tracks player movements using tracking chips!
79,Yes on the field! They put it in their shoulder pads and also the football itself!
80,Yeah no wonder they can get such good accurate stats!
81,Good question. I also really like the yellow first down marker when watching games on tv. ESPN won an Emmy for that.
82,Agreed. I wonder if the NBA uses chips to track stats too? There is even a bball court on top of the USA Supreme Court building.
83,Oh very cool. Wonder if anyone famous has played there? Kareem abul Jabbar used to have such a dominant dunk that it got banned in college!
84,Hello, do you have good knowledge about football players?
85,Same! I like basketball. I am a big fan of the Golden State Warriors. How about you?
86,Nice! Have you been to a game?
87,A few as well. I always go to the stadium early to receive bobbleheads of the basketball players.
88,Awww man, I hope they are worth the price. Reading from the factual section 3, I agree that space jam is the highest-grossing basketball movie. Have you watched it?
89,That is cool. I guess they need some exercise after a hard day's work.
90,Do you play?
91,It's been a while since I played a sport. I used to play basketball, but now it's all about tennis and badminton. Of course in this kind of weather is a no no.
92,For sure, I bet. I am waiting until the sun comes up.
93,Well, in middle school, but not a fan. I only like the 49ers. It is because of my relatives.
94,It was nice talking to you. Happy New Year.
95,i do like football sometimes, not all the time, but sometimes. you?
96,i try to watch the playoffs, maybe the superbowl.
97,I have heard that, but I don't think that women can qualitfy. It's a tough game
98,I would like to see a woman that could do that. I have no problem with that. If she can play, let her in. Put the tracking chips on her.
99,those players spend a lot of time standing around and waiting. i figured that 11 minutes was a bit short, but now that i think about it, it sounds right.
100,Yes, basketball is a sport that flows a lot more.
101,Basketball was invented by a Canadian. A *canadian*
102,He really could not coach. i guess he knew how to create game, not play them.
103,yes, it has. the college coaches make so much. it seems like a distortion of the purpose of college.
104,I wonder where this all going to lead. Soon the degree-granting aspect of college will become optional extra. Anyway, great chat!
105,Interesting. I'm a space junkie, and I'm jel of the internet speed that the International Space Station has.
106,It sure is. It's weird that there are more automated software programs on the internet, than humans.
107,Maybe, as egosurfing is very real. I've never looked myself up, though.
108,I do not. Are you a Snoop Dogg fan? He wrote a song for his son's football team. How cool is that?
109,I don't know. It's amazing that college football teams have 14 of the largest stadiums in the world. I would have thought those would belong to NFL teams.
110,That's funny. Surprisingly, the coaches of the military football teams, are the highest paid employees at the Department of Defense. Seems a little silly that they are worth more than the people who put their lives on the line to keep us safe.
111,That's insane. So is the stadium in TX that cost 60 million...for a highschool team.
112,Who knows. It's a little disgusting to think that they spend so much money on a tracking chip that monitors players every move, and all the stats of a football, yet...we don't have those capabilities on cars.
113,There is a rocket scientist who coaches in the NFL. Matt Patricia, ever heard of him?
114,His school's fight song has six digits of Pi in it, that would be a fun school to attend.
115,Thank you for chatting with me, have a wonderful day.
116,Hi, yeah, I had heard that.  Wonder why one hasn't tried to play, yet?
117,Probably physically tougher than a lot would want to attempt.  A kicker would make a nice start, though!
118,I feel your pain!  The last Super Bowl dragged on over three hours.  Too much standing around and other nonsense.  It should be streamlined and made faster.
119,Wow, that's interesting.  But, I guess that's an average player, not a Tom Brady type.  Do you have a favorite team?
120,New England Patriots are my favorite team, also! Go Pats!
121,I read there are also chips placed in the balls that track various things, as well.  The NFL is getting so high tech, aren't they?
122,I remember when they were banned when they first came out.  Nike had the money to pay all those fines, it didn't matter they made it all back from the exposure it gave them.  Everybody wanted a pair of Air Jordan's!
123,That was very smart of him to do.  Always good to have a fall back career, in case basketball doesn't work out.  The statistics are not good for the average player after leaving the game.  Within 5 years, most are bankrupt.
124,He made one good deal!  I would like to have him negotiate for me! Lol
125,Do you have a favorite basketball team?
126,It is almost super bowl!!! I am so exited. Who are you rooting for
127,I will be using chips super bowl weekend too! I'm leaning towards doritos.... Di you know Steve Smith when he played?
128,Yeah. I am not sure I have the stomach to watch a woman play against some of those men.
129,I wonder if she could eat at the same restauarants as the players. The Saints Cheerleaders cannot....
130,He has been in 2 or 3 known fights with team mates. He broke one of their jaws and he was out for like 8 weeks. I wonder if all the head collision has anything to do with it?
131,Yeah. I worry about the mental health of these football players. A lot of pain and depression in the whole league.
132,Most NFL teams have a psychologist on staff. I hope they reach out to them when they need it. I know a lot of players are retiring early...
133,yeah. I am glad he didn't get hurt. It's always a fear of mine when people go back to college instead of the league.
134,Most athletes are now being told to go pro to end their rookie contract a year earlier. It's that second contract that makes all the money.
135,He's the one that put Nike on the map!
136,You too!
137,I don't, but I do attend a Super Bowl party on the first Sunday of February.
138,Yeah, if they met the eligibility requirements. I wonder if that will happen one day.
139,Yeah, that seems pretty sexist. Even if the cheerleaders were already eating in that restaurant, they have to leave if the players want to eat there. I mean, I know players are more important to the game, but still.
140,I am a woman and don't know if I'd want to play in the NFL even if I could. I'd rather be an engineer. Anyway, over a lifetime, engineers make more than the average NFL player.
141,Right, though I am sure many engineers do watch NFL games to unwind! I am not too interested in football, perhaps because  there are only 11 minutes of live gameplay per game.
142,Yeah. Since ESPN created the superimposed yellow line it has helped out too. They won an emmy for that
143,Yeah, and in footballs too. The sport of football has sure progressed a lot.
144,I don't watch that much. I like to watch comedy, light things. I heard that Jim Carrey doesn't make dramas anymore because he believes he should only play in movies that project positivity.
145,I did but I got bored of it. Apparently others did not since Hugh Laurie is the highest paid actor ever for tv drama.
146,Wow, that's awesome. I wonder what motivated him to become an actor. For Michael Caine, it was because all the prettiest girls at his school were in drama class.
147,I don't watch football much, but it does interest me some. Who do you think will win that football game?
148,Don't Barkely and Beckham Jr. Play for the Giants, though? Or am I thinking of the wrong NFL team? They're in the news for being really good lately.
149,I see. Which NFL team do you think has the best cheerleaders? I think they're pretty talented, too. And they have danger like the football players, too.
150,I don't like how some NFL teams have strange rules like if the cheerleaders are at a restaurant and the football players show up the cheerleaders are expected to leave. Very strange.
151,lol those were the same rules you meant? It is very odd. I think it might have started because it would be too distracting for the cheerleaders and football players to have relationships together?
152,True. I think there's actually a music video made based off of that with football players and cheerleaders like that. I think it's interesting no females have played for the NFL.
153,That sounds like it would be reasonable. I think the average football game only has just over ten minutes of play. Think of how much time that leaves for commercials!
154,Did you know that despite how much NFL players make that engineers make more in a lifetime?
155,I like now the NFL uses chips to track players and the ball. I wish I was the one who invented that or even the one to have the job analyzing the tracking of them. Seems interesting.
156,That would be interesting Almost as interesting as how there's a University where they have the opposingfootball team's locker room painted pink. I'm gonna go watch some Netflix now. ttyl
157,Yeah...I like Alex Smith. He's gotten a raw deal in past, like with SF
158,Yeah, no hype. Can't hurt to have adrian peterson involved too
159,I dunno...but I think that would make for quite a drama. Patrick Stewert would probably lecture about it
160,At this rate they'll probably insert tracking chips on their Cheerleaders.
161,Yeah, you don't need to be a rocket scientist to play football. However, it might help. Lets see how things work out for Matt Patricia.
162,That's why they make the big bucks. The highest paid people in the military are football coaches
163,What unbelievable is that the QB with the most wins in Cleveland doesn't play for the Browns.
164,Well locker rooms are soap operas. They even have soap in them.
165,Well Joe Hamm taught Drama in High School. Ellie Kemper was his student.
166,A few more of those and he could afford a texas High School stadium...which cost $60M to build
167,Take care.
168,Hi, do you like football ?
169,I am  Red Skins fan, like the guy who won the contest at at Bucs game.
170,I like what he did, I was force to wear a Bucs shirts, but underneath there was a RedSkins shirt with the number 47.
171,No, I did not know that, why did they do this ?
172,I don't know, pink, beside being feminine, is quite a neutral color. I would have chosen to decorate the locker with clowns if it was me.
173,I think I would be almost cheating. Do you like watching football on TV ?
174,Do you think that Georgia Tech cheated when they won 222- 00 against Cumberland ?
175,Maybe it was their first game. Or they did not have even a team, so cobbled something with a group of somewhat fit students.
176,Forget, it is too complicated, how would you feel if you won 222-00  ?
177,Me too, I would feel  a little proud, but if I injured myself during the game I would feel really bad, it was not worth it.
178,But people hurt themselves without the aid of the others team. Do you like the other kind of football, like soccer ?
179,There could be some rivalries between the players of the same team. But usually it happens in teams that are already struggling.
180,I heard they are donating a day of clean water for children in need for every minute you don't use your cell phone.
181,That I'm not sure, seems like other things could be given up that would help ease waste produced.
182,Speaking of phones, do you know why New York's area code is 212?
183,Good call, did you ever use one of those rotary phones?
184,Yeah same here, we didn't have one very long, but in my friend's basement we still had to use it for years, one buddy was always confused.
185,Yeah it sure would, not many people own landline phones anymore, I'm assuming you still do correct?
186,Nice, how about tv, do you watch much NFL football during the season?
187,Yeah, but I mainly just follow my local favorite team, they didn't do very well this season.
188,I like the Packers, always have and will.  I used to love watching Brett Favre play. Did you know women can technically play?
189,I think it would be very cool if a female player made a pro roster and played.  It would give hope to young fans out there.
190,I do like it somewhat. I used to love the game but it's so expensive to get tickets now. How about  you? So you enjoy the game?
191,Yes, I was pulling for the under-dog, but the Patriots are tough. What other kinds of 'football' sports have you ever seen?
192,I always am amazed that they don't get hurt more in rugby. I don't understand it but it is interesting especially when they get into those big huddles and push and shove!
193,No, who is that? A football player or a rugby player?
194,That's quite an accomplishment. I imagine a lot of quarter backs would love that stat! I think it's so funny that the University of Iowa painted their visiting team all pink. Pretty obvious psychological tactic!
195,Right! But why are we so caught up in a silly gender specific color! Since it's not against the rules, I assume some day there will be female players and then there may be lots of feminine things in a locker room! Ha.
196,Wow, yes! You forget how many innovations TV has brought to watching the game. Its funny that they won an emmy for it. I only think of emmys as acting awards.
197,That is funny. I bet that same thing isn't true today. NFL players make so much. Can't imagine that its even close to bowler's winnings now. TV has made a big difference in the game. Crazy that they actually only play for 11 minutes each game!
198,I guess that's how they get all those stats. I wonder if they will ever use those chips to determine whether a player steps out of bounds or actually crosses the goal line?
199,So coaches who contest rulings, may be able to use those chips to get the calls reversed to their side?
200,Hi, no I don't but I do sometimes. I think it is a great sport!
201,Very true! It takes hours to watch lol, I think it's great that the nfl has no written rules against female players....
202,Me too! I love women's sports! I think it's crazy that the New Orleans Saints Cheerleaders are never allowed to eat at the same restaurant while any NFL players are dining in!
203,Wow, that is interesting, you would never think that could be true! I find it interesting too that the Nfl uses tracking chips in the players shoulder pads to record their moves on the field, I had no idea!
204,Really? That's awesome, it is a good invention for sure. I didn't know the NFL  merged with the AFL way back in 1966, never knew that!
205,Wow, that is a high score! I think it's great that Everson Griffen spoke up about his mental health issues after he took time off from the Vikings and when he came back he spoke openly about it. I think their is such stigma about mental health that was brave of him!
206,I read about that too, more and more people are coming forward about it and I think it is a good thing. Also Brian Dawkins spoke about his depression during his Hall of Fame induction speech. Great men.
207,He did and even other athletes have come forward about their struggles who play other sports as well, Even Michael Phelps came forward about his struggles.
208,Wow, that's amazing and brave of him to do, none of that can be easy to discuss but it helps others to seek treatment and we need that in America, NFLs Brandon Marshall has called it the civil rights issue of our era.
209,I think it already has among these athletes and hopefully this spreads the positivity to others to get help and suicide is not the answer. Very good thing these men who are looked at as invincible and strong can even have these issues...
210,Good morning.  Yes, I do The New England Patriots.  How about you?
211,No, it's not.  I can't imagine the pressure he felt! Do you watch any Soccer?
212,That's about how much I watch too.  I read somewhere that Snoop Dog wrote a fight song for his son's high school football team.  How cool is that?
213,I know that's true and so hard to believe.  That last Superbowl I watched was about 3 hours long.  I tell you, I was shocked to find out those humongous US flags at football stadiums weigh like 1100 pounds and cost about $50,000 to make!
214,IDK?  Probably be very hard to smuggle out weighing that much! lol I know NFL football is popular, but I had no idea college football was so popular, also.  14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums belong to American College football teams.
215,Yes, my Alma Mater, University of Florida Gators.  Go Gators!  That's a weird rule they have, makes you wonder what happened to prompt that rule to be put in place?
216,Me too! You know as big as NFL and college football are, there is a high school football stadium in Texas that seats 18,000 and cost $60 million to build.
217,Apparently, that is true! On a different note, do you own a car?
218,Yeah, that was nice of Mcdonald's to do and it has revolutionized the fast food industry for sure. I just moved to Ohio, where it is cold and just found out it is illegal to warm my car up in the morning.  Isn't that crazy?
219,It's useless up here.  I can't wait to get back to Florida.  I freeze every morning!
220,He seems to be... but he can't run an NFL franchise if you ask me!
221,LOL... he's a business man that owns a multimillion dollar franchise.  How is that an excuse?
222,I am sure if someone can make a ventriliquist act be succesful on radio, then there is no excuse for him.  By the way can you please respond faster?  I don't have all day!
223,Yeah i saw that!  I wanna hear solar activity into sound  Thts cool!
224,Man... can you believe that the only president ever to have a PHD was Woodrow wilson, thats crazy!
225,And the last president to speak a foreign language was FDR... geez!
226,He's fine.... i think all politicians are fake... he's probably the most real one we have had in a long time.
227,I a, sure it is... it is for the president!  LOL  See snoop wrote a fight song for his HS?
228,I used to, but i don't have cable anymore.
229,WOW... that's awesome!   I love that yellow line!!!  See college stadiums are some of the biggest stadiums in the world?
230,Great chat... thanks for picking up the pace!
231,Do you like the NFL?  I read the other day that the average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameaplay
232,wow that is crazy.  I also saw that the NFL has no written rule against female players
233,That is interesting.  I saw that the NFL uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move
234,wow that sounds great.  I just saw that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an NFL player.  Maybe staying in school is good!
235,oh well that is helpful for sure.  I saw something strange.  the new orleans saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as any NFL player and if they are already dining and one walks in they are required to leave
236,ha ha thats funny.  I saw that the university of Iowa's locker room for visiting football team is painted pink.
237,wow that is crazy that he is the only one.  Did you know that the highest score ever in a football game occured in 1916 when Georgia Tech defeated cumberland 222-0
238,I am not certain about that.  I saw that the ESPN won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the firsts down line for american football games
239,that would be fun to see.  I saw that former patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis has never fumbled the football in his NFL career
240,yes, I think I've heard that before.  In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football starts
241,oh wow didn't nkow that, did you know that the NFL has no rules against female players?
242,ya I don't like how they aren't allowed to eat with players, that seems like an outtdated rule and also really dumb
243,ya they definitely stretch taht over 2 hours sometimes, did you know the avg earnings of an engineer is more than that of an nfl playier?
244,thats true, thats lots of down time, are you aware of teh tracking chips the nfl uses?
245,that is cool, hopefully they dont use those on the Saints cheerleaders, that would be creepy!
246,ya that is weird, I wonder if that hurts or helps them, I think that would  make me play better haha
247,haha true! crazy how popular bowling was in the 60s, the top bowlers made more than football players!
248,good piont, can't believe the highest scoring football game was 222-0, thats a blowout!
249,haha true, do you think Kellan Moore being left handed give him an advantage?
250,huh that is interesting, did you hear about how smart Alex Smith was in school?
251,oh ya, he could have done a lot even outside of the NFL
252,Yea, I like the NFL., don't think Colt McCoy's signing with the Redskins was a good move
253,I think Colt McCoy made out good, he gets to stay with coach Jay Gruden, I think the Redskins could of found someone better or paid less for him
254,Well they did have Alex Smith and were on the way to the playoffs until he got injured and 32 year old McCoy started
255,Yea, I guess Gruden finds McCoy a great sideline presence
256,Well there is no rule in the NFL against women player, I'm sure they could be place kickers at least
257,I wonder if Gruden was the coach of Tom Brady's JV footbal team that failed to start him or win a game
258,Probably. Did you know Alex Smith started college as a Junior and was working on a masters before being drafted?
259,On the other side of the spectrum Baker Mayfield was considering being a competitive gamer instead of a qb
260,Yea, plus the average NFL game only has an average of 11 minutes of gameplay
261,You too, I think I'm going to watch some football on ESPN and enjoy the emmy winning Yellow line they invented
262,Have a good one
263,What do you mean by sensible loss? I think John Gruden is a huge mistake for the team.
264,John Gruden is an NFL head coach. He's not a player. The 33-13 loss to the Rams was just the beginning of a miserable season. Are you familiar with the NFL?
265,Football is one of my favorite sports and I follow all 32 teams. Khalil Mack was traded to the Bears by John Gruden for some picks. They definitely felt his absence. I don't know why they didn't just resign him.
266,I like the Giants best, you?. He did demand a high salary. He's the highest paid defensive player in the NFL. I guess the Raiders tied up too much money in Carr and Gruden.
267,Well congratulations on the Super Bowl. Did you know the average NFL game only has 11 minutes of game play? No wonder my girlfriend gets bored.
268,Yeah who knew? It's quite an interesting game and a big business. They use tracking chips embedded in shoulder pads now to track players. They even have them inside footballs now.
269,ESPN actually won an Emmy for the creation of the yellow line for 1st downs on TV. The power of technology.
270,Do you follow any other kinds of football besides American football?
271,I mostly just an American football guy. Interesting that Rugby is also considered a type of football
272,Do you remember Benjarvus Green-Ellis? He was a RB on the Patriots.
273,I definitely am.  Watching the Super Bowl has become a family tradition.  What about you?
274,For college, yes, but I don't have a specific rooting interest when it comes to the NFL.  I have a feeling I end up cheering on the American Football Conference in the Super Bowl more often than not.
275,It just so happens I have.  I'm a Nebraska Cornhusker fan, which makes us rivals (even if the last several years haven't gone our way).  I bet when we are the road team it's those pink visitor locker rooms that are doing us in?
276,Hats off to you for being able to like both teams.  I guess we were separated by conferences for a long time.  At least we never had any 222-0 type outcomes on either side.  Can you imagine what Cumberland must have felt in 1916 after Georgia Tech did that to them?
277,Considering I have never heard of Cumberland, maybe that was it for them?  Or maybe they lasted until the 1960s when, amazingly enough top bowlers were making twice what football players were.
278,I have no idea. I bet TV had a lot to do with the shift though.  Think about all the innovation in television have come through sports.  I couldn't imagine a game without the first down yellow line and have to remember that isn't actually on the field.  I give ESPN trouble, but all credit to them for that creation which earned them an Emmy.
279,Maybe ESPN's tech department is filled with brilliant folks like Alex Smith who got is degree in two years!
280,I know they invest a ton of money in the game, but I'd love to hear more about these chips.
281,It's a rough sport!  It's crazy to think that just 11 minutes or so of actual game play/hitting over the course of three hours can be so damaging.
282,You as well!  Have a great evening!
283,I love it. Do you know what color is the U of Iowa visitor locker room?
284,I wonder if it is supposed to have some effect on them
285,Yes that is why bowlers made way more than them
286,Yes that is 222-0 , do you know who played?
287,Yes. Did you know ESPN won an Emmy once?
288,Yes. Do you know Green-Ellis never fumbled the ball?
289,Yes there is no rule that says that they cannot play
290,Yeah. Did you know the average live gameplay is only 11 minutes?
291,True. Engineers make more than football players over the lifetime
292,True. WHat do you think of that rule for Saints cheerleaders?
293,I am not. I watch it because I have a son who likes it. Also, I think the Saints are sexist with how they treat their cheerleaders, and the league should do something about it.
294,I don't know, but it must be frustrating to have to leave in the middle of your meal.
295,I have not seen it, I don't watch the superbowl. I know there are a lot of girls who play in high school, many are kickers. I hope a woman decides to try out one day.
296,That's interesting. Especially since it is still in use today.  It's funny that the top bowlers used to make more than the top football players.
297,I don't know, it was back in the 60's. Then again, engineers make more than the average player these days
298,That does seem weird. I guess there is a RB for the Patriots who has never fumbled.
299,Nothing surprises me anymore. Although, with the Browns getting OBJ in trade, I'm thankful Baker Mayfield didn't quit football to become a pro gamer.
300,Some of them make millions at one tournament. I guess he's pretty good at Halo 3, which is a hard game.
301,Wow. That must have been a bad year for Hollywood, if they won for that. Its funny when you realize that Tom Brady's highschool coach didn't want to play him.
302,Maybe he was that bad? lol, I know I shouldn't say that about a super bowl champ.
303,Thats really interesting. I wonder if that effects the next years team
304,I like the 49ers,  How about you?  I recently found out that the NFL uses tracking chips.
305,Wow thats great.  I prefer baseball than football though.  What do you like about football?
306,Did you know there was only one left handed quarterback in the NFL?
307,That is interesting.  The left handed quarterback was named Kellan Moore.
308,The huddle was created by a deaf quarterback.
309,Yes,  he calls the shots basically.
310,lol well professional gamers dont get injured as much,  I say go for it.
311,Yeah thats why I suggest professional gaming,  they dont get injured lol
312,Do you Alex smith?  he took so many ap tests in high school that he entered university as a jounior.
313,Thanks you as well.
314,A bit but not regularly. I did see the beginning of the superbowl a few weeks ago, but I only have a passing knowledge of football
315,Do you mean the basketball player on the hall of fame? Otherwise, I don't know a reggie miller in football
316,I don't know much but I think he was a quarterback. Correct me if I'm wrong
317,Wow he must be brilliant or a very hard worker. I like quarterbacks since they lead the offense.
318,While I don't know much about alex, I tend to follow players like kellan moore who is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl
319,I mean I know it is inherently harder if you are left handed as a QB
320,I also think Brady johnson is impressive as well since he has even thrown a touchdown pass to himself
321,I don't know his name, but I think he was deaf right? What is his name?
322,In any case, I like following players like tom brady, brady jonson, and etc
323,While there aren't any explicit rules against them, don't the requirements pretty much disqualify them anyway?
324,I do! I LOVE football!! Hard to believe the NFL is made up of 32 teams.
325,That is crazy! I know the NFL uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field.
326,Oh wow! That is something. It must be to track ball velocity, rotation, ball speed and location.
327,I do too! Did you know that the first NFL playoff game was played in 1932 on an 80 yard dirt field inside Chicago stadium, the then home to the Blackhawks.
328,That I'm not sure of, but I know Chicago has changed a lot.
329,I would say quarterback is one I know the most about. I know that only two african-american quarterbacks have won the Super Bowl.
330,He is. I agree. Did you know Kellan Moore is the only left-handed QB in the NFL?
331,I can't even imagine. Superbowl winning quarterback, Brad Johnson is the only quarterback in history to throw the winning touchdown to himself!
332,It had to be a recovered fumble. Did you know that QB Russell Wilson is still under contract for major league baseball?
333,Yes! He has not played since 2011.
334,I don't follow pro football that much.  I was following the Saints (home team) when it looks like they were on track for another Super Bowl, but then got robbed of a victory.
335,Yes, it has a big draw, especially today when a lot of people are glued to their TVs for the Super Bowl.  What do you think of the quarterback match up: Patriots Brady (age 41) versus Rams Mannion (age 26)?
336,It is a battle of experience versus youth.  I am not set on any position, but it seems like in grade school football being QB was everyone's goal.  Did you know that the circular huddle was created by a deaf quarterback, Paul D. Hubbard, so the opposing team could not read his hand signals?
337,I don't know, but doubt it.  A left handed hitter is a plus in pro baseball, but I can't see it mattering in football.  I tend to follow collegiate' s more, my alma mater LSU.  Did you know University of Iowa painted the visitor's locker room pink?  You got to wonder if it is intimidation, disrespect, good humor, or a combination of those?
338,I did too, Louisiana boy Terry Bradshaw, QB for the Steelers.  He is one of the reasons the Steelers have the most Super Bowl wins of any NFL team.  If you followed the NFL playoffs, you might have noticed that the NFL has a female ref, Sarah Thomas.  Do you think they will every have female players?
339,We will have to wait and see.  Some of the traditions in football are peculiar, if not humorous.  For example, Saints chearleaders cannot be in the same resturant with any NFL player, even if they were there first.
340,I would have liked to have known the G forces the Saints receiver took in that "no call pass interference" play in the playoff game with the Rams.  What do you think of the salaries.  We know what the stars make, but not the backups and the 2nd string.  I wonder how the average salary with the short career span stacks up against other jobs?
341,They do earn more per hour playing, but it is a short career, often 10 years or less, while a good engineer would likely get 35-40 years of service.  You brought up the chips in shoulder pads, but other techs have also changed the game, or at least how it is viewed.  Did you know ESPN won an Emmy for the TV yellow line showing the first down position?
342,I agree.  With the yellow line, you can really visualize how far they need to move the ball.   It also lets the armchair QBs speculate on what plays the real QBs will call.  Most of these guys are really smart.  Did you know QB Alex Smith entered college as a Junior and was working on a Masters when he entered the NFL draft?
343,I agree, but they also have coach to QB communications in the QB's helmet these days.  What I really don't like is when the QB is a prima donna.    They need great backs and receivers.  Like Benjarvus Green-Ellis who never fumbled in his NFL career.
344,Same to you.  I guess I will go man the grill for our half time feast.
345,I was not aware of that. I'm surprised because they do have some sexist policies. Do you know about their rules regarding Saints cheerleaders?
346,They are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant with players. If a player enters and they are already sitting and eating they have to get up and leave.
347,I don't know but I find it upsetting. It seems completely unreasonable. Did you know that the average gameplay time in a game is 11 minutes?!
348,I am but I'm just using it as an excuse to eat bad food ha ha. Were you aware that players and footballs have tracking chips in them to record their every move?
349,Me either. I wonder why they don't use that for plays instead of just reviews?
350,That is shocking to me. I'm sure they leave with way less medical issues also. I was shocked when I learned that in the 60's bowlers made more than football players!
351,I do not understand how that is even possible. Are you familiar with RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis?
352,He never fumbled the football once in his whole career which is astonishing.
353,Well he was badly injured and I doubt he comes back so I'm sure his intelligence will get him somewhere else. I believe he was already working on his Master's when drafted.
354,I can't believe that was so recent. I can't imagine watching a game without that line.
355,I sure do. Did you know that women can play on the NFL?
356,I have no idea but it is good that if they qualify they have that option to play
357,I do not but I enjoy watching the games even though there are only 11 minutes of gameplay altogether
358,I know we are glued tot he TV for what feels like forever
359,I cannot say that I do for sure. Did you know that engineers make more over their lifetime than football players?
360,Yeah they seem to be collecting lots of info with those chips like velocity and rotation and such
361,Wow that is mind blowing. I wonder if they they can use that data in any way to make the game safer too
362,I hope so. DO you know that ESPN won an EMmy once and if so, what for?
363,It was for the superimposed yellow line, pretty cool
364,Same here and hope you have a great one.
365,Hi, how are you? Sometimes.
366,I think that there could be women at certain positions, like kicker. Women would probably draw a lot of interest, increase the TV audience.
367,On a per-minute basis, they make a great wage. Did you know that there is only one left-handed quarterback in the NFL? Kellan Moore. I'm surprised. I thought there would have been more, considering the number of lefty pitchers in the MLB.
368,They can't be in the same restaurant as the players. Not cool.
369,Probably not the same for high school football, though. Funny story: The Junipero Serra high school had a season in which they didn't win a game or even score a touchdown. Nevertheless, they never started their backup QB, Tom Brady. And, as a sarcastic comment, we all know what a loser he was.
370,That makes sense. Helps with strategy. The highest score ever in a football game was in 1916: Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0. What was the spread on that game, I wonder.
371,I heard. For that yellow line. Hm. Probably a weak year for awards.
372,Hard to believe, but I guess it had to happen eventually. In the 60s top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars. Still, I wonder how much bowlers made overall. Was it that much money?
373,The college game seems to be a bit silly in some ways. The University of Iowa tries to use cheesy psychology on the other team. They pained the visitor's locker room completely pink. I wonder whether that works at all. Why wouldn't other teams do it as well?
374,No, never met the guy.
375,Well, it's been fun talking with you! Have a great evening! Enjoy the football!
376,Good morning!  Doing well!  Are you much of a NLF fan?
377,Yes, I enjoy watching a good with friends and beers!  Who's your team?
378,No hate at all - it's pretty impressive what they've done and look to continue to dominate.  By proxy, I follow the Cardinals, but don't really consider them my team - I just like good games, teams, players
379,TB & Bilichek are definitely GOATs!  Interesting comparison to Trump - it's hard not to have an opinion!
380,That reminds me of the story where Michael Jordan had a hard time making his HS Varsity team - some coaches cannot see greatness if it's staring them in the face!
381,It's amazing how far the NFL and professional sports in general have come in terms of popularity and revenue.  I've heard that pro bowlers used to make more money than football players!
382,I think the average career in the NFL is 3 season, for the average player with a league minimum salary, so a life time career as an engineer should make more money!
383,Interesting - who is the lefty QB.  Is that a system thing, are lefties discouraged from QB at an early age.  I don't see what the big deal is - baseball pitchers can be both.  Does it really matter that much in football?
384,Right!  Anything to give a different look, roll the other way.  Once the ball is in the air, whats the difference.  I need answers from the NFL!
385,Congrats on another Lombardi Trophy!  It was a strange playoff season, but great win for the Pats - great chatting with you today, really appreciate it!
386,I do. Do you?
387,I watch all the time. My wife is not happy about my sports adiction though. My favorite team is the bears. Do you have a favorite team?
388,I put chips in my belly. Does that count?
389,Chicago hosted the first playoff game in 1932 on an 80 yard dirt field.
390,Yeah. Did you know there's a $60M stadium in Texas? FOR HIGH SCHOOL?
391,I could not imagine being so rich I donated to the construction of a $60M HS football stadium. Im just trying to keep my lights on.
392,I feel like there are too many commercials and replays and measurements.
393,Maybe that's why i usually drink too much watching the games.
394,At least I am not the only one! Although I am usually the only one watching football and drinking.
395,Agreed. But I also think the lower end of the spectrum's avg career is like 2 years.
396,I love it. Do you know what color is the U of Iowa visitor locker room?
397,Me either. Did you know bowlers made more than footballers in the 60s?
398,True. Do you know what is the highest score in college football?
399,Yes it was Georgia Tech that beat Cumberland in 1916
400,Yes they won it for the superimposed yellow line
401,Very true. Did you know that women can play in the NFL too?
402,Yeah. The gameplay is only 11 minutes anyways
403,I know right? Do you know of that rule for Saints cheerleaders?
404,Yes and they also have to leave mid meal if they walk in
405,I sure do. He was a back up QB when he was in high school
406,Their loss really I guess. Nice chat today
407,Good afternoon!  Football is not my favorite sport, but I do enjoy a good game.
408,That psychology might be a bit antiquated because I think a lot of guys don't feel the same about pink as they used to in the good old days
409,Interesting - I have heard about the subconscious affect that color has on mood (never paint a kitchen red) but I wasn't sure if that was just an urban myth?
410,Very true - and circling back to the pink locker room, I'm sure the initial intent was to emasculate the opponent and beat them before they take the field
411,I've heard that, that they didn't think they needed the rule because in the old days the game was much different as were the social norms.  I know some females have played in college football recently
412,Totally agree - if they have the ability and the desire to play in the NFL, awesome.  But I sure as heck wouldn't want my daughters anywhere near that field!
413,College cheerleaders for sure have a ton of injuries as they do way more of the flipping and gymnastics.  I've seen NFL Cheerleaders up close and they basically just stand there for 80% of the game....
414,I bet back in the day the distraction proved to be big enough of a problem that those non-fraternization rules were implemented.  Today, it's so much of a business that I doubt it would be much of an issue
415,I bet if the Cheerleaders had a union like the players do, they could get that rule thrown out!
416,I did know that, because the NFL Network replays games during the week and they are able to trim them down to about a 30 min segment (with commercials) - it is amazing how little action there is in an "action packed" game!
417,And the incessant TV timeouts!!!   After a bad game, I feel like I just wasted 3 hours of my life - and it was only really 11 min!?!?!
418,I wish they would put those chips in the ball - so they could tell when it crosses the endzone or out of bounds!
419,You're probably right - tradition over technology!  Hey, in case this ends abruptly - it's been great chatting with you!
420,Hey! Well, I follow games, but I wouldn't say I'm really fan. How about you?
421,No, it's absolutely surprise for me
422,Friend of mine told me that. Yes, it's fact
423,It looks like old tradition, which doesn't make any sense.
424,Don't you think this rule is terrible? What if they were eating?
425,It's very funny. They want to shock enemies. Anyway it's funny
426,Me too actually. Did you know that the highest score ever in a football game was 222-0 in 1916?
427,Me too. It's even difficult to guess. Also I'm surprised that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than average lifetime earnings of an NFL player. I was sure they make a lot.
428,I guess my dad knows it. He knows about Tom Brady quite a lot.
429,I agreed. He didn't show his best. Anyway it is sport. You never know...
430,Yes, I know. I don't know a lot of such facts, but somehow I've heard about it.
431,Thanks, my friend! Have a good one!
432,Yeah I'm not very interested in football so it took me a while to get through. I did think it was a little crazy that the NFL uses tracking chips on their players and equipment though
433,Right? I would love to see a female in the NFL. I also couldn't believe that the American flags they use weight 1100- like I know they're big but its hard to imagine a flag weighing that much haha
434,I don't remember reading about that just now in my article, but it sounds familiar. It has something to do with them not being able to hang out right? Like they can't go to the same parties or other places at the same time, yeah?
435,Is it always the cheerleaders that have to leave? Like if she's already there and a player walks in, she has to be the one to go? Thats really strange
436,That's...really weird. Speaking of weird, I guess there is a high school stadium in Texas that cost $60 million to build and seats 18,000 people- who knew people cared that much about high school football?!
437,Yeah that makes sense. I guess if I had nothing else, I might have to turn to football for entertainment haha. Did you read about Matt Patricia? Apparently he was a rocket scientists before his NFL coaching job.
438,Hah that is actually pretty funny! I wonder if its effective in throwing off the opposing team a bit. I read that Kellan Moore is the only left handed quarterback in the NFL- not the most interesting fact, but kind of surprising. I didn't think being left-handed was that uncommon. I wonder how many left handed ones they've had overall?
439,Is being left-handed unusual in baseball too?  Or are you saying its not uncommon? Speaking of baseball, I guess Russell Wilson is still under an MLB contract? I didn't know that was possible!
440,Right- that's what I thought! I feel like these are good for potential trivia questions haha Like I read that Snoop Dogg wrote a fight song for his son's high school team. I wonder what that sounds like haha
441,222? Thats insane. I wonder how long that game lasted?
442,Only if they have a female player on their teams.
443,I'm a New Orleans native, and won't support the Saints, until they get rid of that archaic rule regarding cheerleaders being in the same restaurants as the players.
444,Mine doesn't cheer, as I don't like the culture. My son's girlfriend plays football for their school, she's their kicker. I'm surprised no NFL team has a woman kicker.
445,Do they also have tracking chips in their balls over there/
446,Thats insane. I think it's invasive, and wouldn't want a tracker in my shoulder pads, if I were a player.
447,Maybe. I still can't believe ESPN won an Emmy for that superimposed yellow line. Must have been a bad year, if they won for that.
448,It's interesting that Baker Mayfield thought about becoming a pro gamer. I wonder how that would have worked out for him.
449,He is a Halo 3 guru, I guess. If they are at that level, then they probably make more than what a scholarship is worth. I know some of the pros make millions.
450,I suppose as long as their reflexes hold out. It's funny, pro bowlers used to make more than pro football players.
451,The same could be said for footall.
452,I don't understand that either, any more than I understand why there is only one left handed quarterback. It's been fun, have a good one.
453,Hello! I hope you like football! Because I am ready to talk about football!  Do you ilke football?
454,I love any type of football! association football (known as soccer in some countries), Australian rules, rugby football! But the good ol' National Football League (NFL) might be my favorite!
455,With 32 teams, it's hard to pick! Who do you like?
456,Wow, just 11 minutes? Is that it? I know the NFL uses tracking chips embedded in shoulders to track players moves. That's a lot of work for just 11 minutes of live play!
457,They sure are an innovative league! Did you know there is even a rocket scientist coaching in the NFL?!
458,It is! He was an aeronautical engineer before coaching in the NFL! His school, RPI, even had the words "sin", "cosine", and "tangent" in their fight song!
459,Yeah! I do like the entertainment thought. You know, we talked about fight songs a minute ago; did you know that Snoop Dogg wrote a fight song for his son's high school football game!?
460,I thought so too! You know, even high school football is really popular. There is a high school football stadium in Allen, Texas with 18,000 seats!
461,Yup! That's the one! So much money is spent on football! Did you know that those humongous American flags at football stadiums cost $50,000 to make!?
462,Indeed! And those flags weigh 1,100 pounds! Go big or go home, as they say! Good bye!
463,Hi, yes, sports in general !! and of course about football!
464,hahaha that is pretty funny and not intimidating at all!
465,Wow that shocked me... nothing like that today did you know three football coaches are the highest paid employees of the us defense department!
466,wow what a score!! did you know there is a fight song from a school written by snoop dog!
467,I think that is cool! Technology has allowed for a way more exciting game, like the tracking chips!
468,wow, I wouldn't want a change like that.. did you know there are many other types of football like soccer, rugby  gaelic football!!
469,Cool I love soccer, follow the FC barcelona... but do not know anything about Australian football!
470,Seems like it but the reality is that the whole show if worth it and with the tracking chip you get info like the ball speed, the velocity and that adds to the average 11 minute hahaha
471,Oh wow. But i think is way more fun to play football... but I think the engineer has to work many more years.. Have you seen the super super big flags at the football stadiums
472,They weight more that 1000 pounds and cost about $50,000 wow!
473,He seems to have done well, Alex Smith struggled in that game.  He is typically on point, to what I know,
474,He is ready and willing to do what ever Gruden will give him.  Definitely a hard worker.
475,That is kinda crazy, I wonder how much that pay was, and what the gap is today.
476,Neither did I .  That is a pretty large gap.  In most games there is only 11 minutes of live game play anyway, that game must have had a lot more.
477,It is amazing that what they come up with, the huddle has become iconic.
478,He is the guy that the quarterback hands the ball off to.
479,Im not sure, but I know they do use the data from the chips to make play safer for them and make their pads better.
480,Yeah, Gaelic football is the same way, Im not sure how it works but it isnt for the weak.
481,Me too.  I always played growing up.  I loved watching the world cup this past summer.
482,I know, I bet they feel a little stupid now seeing what he has become.
483,I know he has become a more dominant force as he gains experience.  Anyway, nice chat!  Have a good night.
484,I love football, Go Detroit Lions!! What about you?
485,It will be interesting to see how Foles does from here on out, must be irritating for Eagles fans never knowing!
486,That is funny, I don't care for patriots but can't help but like Brady, a Michigan man go blue!!
487,I've read that Snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his son's football team in high  school, that could be interesting!
488,I was also interested to read about the Lions' coach is a rocket scientist! Have you seen him during a game? So rough looking
489,That is good to hear, some of those NFL players don't seem too intelligent, and can be so cocky and
490,Oh how cool is that! Also interesting is that they embed chips in the should pads to track the players every move
491,Yes that is a scary thing!
492,Definitely, so many people can be so competitive it gets scary.
493,I have no idea, but would guess maybe 77?
494,Holy cow that is a huge score, and Cumberland didn't even make it on the board!
495,I like the Steelers. How bout you.
496,I did know that. You would think there would be more.
497,I think its an amazing technology. The things they can do these days.
498,That's interesting to think about. I bet belichek has already checked into that.
499,I know right. They get all that money for 11 minutes worth of entertainment.
500,Yeah but I think it would be a lot more fun to play football for a living.
501,I think the players union has rectified that situation.
502,To mess with the visiting team. Do you think it worked.
503,They were just rubbing it in that last 200 points huh.
504,Yeah and the huddle has become so engrained into football. Its hard to think of the game without it.
505,I like the nfl. Not so much the ravens.
506,Im a steelers fan and we play them twice a year. I promise you Im not worried about lamar Jackson.
507,Jackson can run but he cant throw at all. You all got a pretty good QB up there in KC tho
508,Brady will be out in the next few years. I would say staying healthy and not falling off like a lot of guys do after one good year is his main concerns.
509,To be honest the chiefs scare me more than the patriots do at this point.
510,I sure hope so. Im sick of them. Lol. Did you know that there is a rocket scientist coaching in the nfl.
511,His name is mat patrecia. Im not sure who he coaches.
512,Yeah I dont see that doing much. It would make a good team laugh and who cares what it does to a bad team. Lol.
513,That huddle has grown into a major part of the game.
514,I think he was drafted by the patriots wasnt he. I didnt think he was a first rounder either.
515,Have a good one.
516,Yes.  I watch it all season long and even have been watching the Alliance league.
517,I didn't know that.  Come to think of it I can't recall any lefties.  Former Patriots running back Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled the ball once during his career.  Impressive.
518,I would say that would go to Jim Brown.  Espn won an emmy award of creating the superimposed first down line.  Nice.
519,I agree.  In the 1960s top bowlers made two times as much as the top football stars of that era.
520,LOL  Do you know what the highest score ever was for a football game at the college level?
521,222-0!  Georgia tech beat Cumberland in 1916.
522,lol That's funny!  They must do that to get in the heads of who they are playing.
523,I don't think they probably really care. Do you know who Alex Smith is?
524,Yes.  He's a QB.  He was the first pick in the 2005 draft by the 49er's.  What's impressive about him is that he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 2 years!
525,No.  He's a righty.  I'm surprised that there's only 11 minutes of live gameplay per an average NFL game.
526,I do!  I know that Kellan Moore is the only left handed QB in the NFL.
527,He's retired.  But, he's coaching one of the teams in the new American Alliance of Football league.  Do you have a favorite QB?  Mine is Baker Mayfield.
528,Mahomes is good and I like Dalton.  Be curious to see what Mahomes does next year.  See if teams can adjust to him.  Baker Mayfield once considered quitting football to pursue a full time competitive gaming career.  Yikes!  That sounds too risky.
529,I didn't know that.  That's pretty impressive!  The circular huddle was created by a deaf QB named Paul Hubbard so the other team could not read his hand signals.
530,I do.  I've been an NFL fan my whole life.  Probably more so though before big money changed the game.
531,I did know that.  I wonder if we'll see one soon.  Maybe a kicker?
532,Did you know that there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay per game?
533,Short time considering they stretch out a game to 3 hours. lol  What do you think of the tracking chips they put in the players shoulder pads and footballs to track data?
534,I've wondered if they could be attracted to other chips?  Like would the chips in the balls be programmed to be attracted to the chips in the wide receivers shoulder pads?
535,The highest scoring football game ever was 222-0 when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland in 1916.  What a blowout!
536,It's pretty entertaining. Can you believe the very first playoff game was in 1932?
537,Yeah, on an 80-yard long dirt field that was the home of an NHL team!
538,The field of the first playoff game in 1932 was actually on a dirt field inside the Chicago stadium which was where the Blackhawks played their games at the time.
539,Nice. Did you know there was a football coach in the NFL who is also literally a rocket scientist?
540,That's cool. The Lions have a pretty good quarterback.
541,I can't believe there is only one left-handed quarterback in the league.
542,No, it's Kellan Moore.
543,I don't, I'm more of a baseball fan. Though Russell Wilson plays both!
544,Cool. Yeah, Wilson is technically still under an MLB contract even though he hasn't played since 2011.
545,Yeah, the Rangers traded him to the Yankees last year.
546,You, too! Have a good one!
547,Yes I did. Did you?
548,Both defenses did play good. Who were the two QBs more valuable than Tom Brady?
549,I see. Are you talking about the super bowl or the entire season?
550,But there were not passing touch downs last night.
551,I see. Yes that was a very good pass. Not many QBs could make that throw.
552,The Dallas Cowboys. I've been watching them since I was a little kid. How about you?
553,That's awesome. It's always nice when your favorite team wins the championship. The Cowboys won their division but lost in the 2nd round of the playoffs this year.
554,Really? That's a pretty crazy rule that I  have never hard of. Did you also know that Brad Johnson is the only QB to ever throw  touchdown pass to himself?
555,It was near the goal line and when he threw the ball it was deflected by a lineman but went right back to him. He caught it and ran it in. Was pretty crazy.
556,Yeah it would seem like a lot longer than 11 minutes to me as well.
557,Hello there I do watch it, how about you?
558,I follow the Packers, how about you?
559,I heard about that, that is too funny, and I guess it's proven to help the other team relax.
560,I think I heard that, I think it would be very cool to see a female player make a roster and play.
561,Yeah it sure would be, even if it was just kicker to start.
562,I think so, the one where they would have to leave a place if members of the team show?
563,Yeah I would have to agree with you there, seems dumb to me to be honest.
564,Yeah I watch some college but not very closely, always seems like the same schools, how about you?
565,I heard about that wow!  I wonder how many of the fans of the opposing team were still in the stands at the end?
566,Yeah they just cancel the whole program lol, and how did they even score that many? You can't even score that much in Tecmo Super Bowl.
567,yes,Anyone who has ever tuned into an NFL broadcast knows that plenty of air time is spent showing players huddling, coaches yelling, and fans cheering
568,I do not like that
569,I do not know that. It would be nice if it happened.
570,sorry i do not know that details.
571,yes i think,College Football ... Visiting locker rooms are often cramped places that aren't meant to be . for a home team's opponents, but the Hawkeyes take things up a notch
572,yes i know little bit, Sep 7, 2017 - Last season, Zebra Technologies brought next-gen stats to the NFL by implementing their RFID chips in NFL players' pads to track speed,
573,I think,Ten running backs were faster, and wide receiver John Ross set the combine record at 4.22. But it's Fournette, the 240-pound bruiser
574,Sorry i don't know that details please explain.
575,I like, The Green Bay Packers are a professional American football team based in Green Bay, Wisconsin.
576,okay, that nice. which player you mostly like?
577,I do! I know that the NFL only has one left handed quarterback now, do you?
578,and the great Steve Young haha. Can you believe bowlers once earned more money than football players?
579,It really has, or has football gone up?
580,I wonder if he is still great at Halo 3? I'm surprised Alex Smith is still playing, given he's basically a genius!
581,Oh for sure. I love watching football games, but hate that there is only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay.
582,I didn't know that, I wonder if any have tried out for teams! I hate that the New Orleans Saints kick cheerleaders out of restaurants if a player comes in though!
583,Maybe it is needed for the players? Could you imagine being at that college game where the score was 222-0?
584,I think the whole team would just quit after that haha. that was in 1916 though so it might have gotten better!
585,I thought that was always interesting, I wonder if it actually did affect other teams?
586,Maybe they should get an emmy like ESPN did for their yellow line during gameplay?
587,I have no Idea is it American Football Champions?
588,Haahahaaaa, ok thats awesome i hope so too, why is it called football anyways? They play it with their hands. I dont get it some times.
589,you got that right lol, i feel the same way too, I love soccer, and i love watching the Players brawl in American football though, so talented I just Hope no one dies in the field one day they are talented and strong though, did you know that Kellan moore is the only left handed QB in the NFL? I GUESS RIGHT HANDED PEOPLE ARE JUST MORE FIT TO BE qbS.
590,Not in perticular I am forced to follow them though because of my job, I love talking about sports with my clients
591,Exactly I agree with you, with sports everything is into play though including race, I dont know how they choose the QB, But I know a fact that Only 2 Black QBs have won the Super bowl
592,Ohhh lol we were not so off then Its Close to American Football Confrence, they have come from far though, for example I read somewhere that The first nfl play off game was played on a dirt field in Chicago, but now look how fancy the fields are too much money lol, do you think players are overpaid?
593,ohhh wow, now I know what NFL and AFC are so what is NFC then?
594,Wow too complicate, I know though that NFL is one of the 4 majoy pro sports leagues in North America. I think thats pretty boss, and one thing I like is that They play football here in america and it makes enough money to get the Robert Krafts rich literally The Nfl Does not have to sell the sport anywhere else if it does not want to.
595,I hear you My friend they have so much money if they can pay the Athlets that much, lol how much do you think they keep?? wait what do you mean no rule against female players? you mean they can play on a male team?
596,ohhh wow! those guys are giants literally, but surprisingly young too, Tom Brady is getting too old for them I think thats why Patriots are not doing very good this year, do you believe women should play on an NFL team?
597,Yes, I am a big Packers fan!
598,No way, hate them. What about Demarcus Lawrence not getting the praise like he should? He is a great pass rusher!
599,Yeah, that would suck to be them. The cheerleaders already don't get paid. I would be so embarrassed.
600,What! Thats crazy and those quarterback better stay in school and not rely on their bodies. Alex Smith is very smart, ya know?
601,Yeah and did it right. He can play and get degrees! Did you know the huddle was created by a deaf man?
602,Exactly, he didn't want anyone to see his hand signals. That is so cool.
603,Yes, and Mayfield is my guy! He is from OU and we would go watch him play all the time. Ya know he wasn't gonna go for football once in his life?
604,HA, nice! I like confidence! Yeah Mayfield was gonna go become a gaming pro because nobody could beat him, according to him. Yes a pink room would be embarrassing and deflating for the other team..
605,Oh, that is an interesting outlook. I think I agree.lol Ya know the highest scoring game occured in 1916 when Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland 222-0. Can you believe that?
606,Thank you for the new perspective! Im gonna run with it
607,Im great, are you a football fan?
608,I think that was a low shot, hitting Antonio Brown like that, what are your thoughts?
609,It did, I bet his teamates were upset because of this, it was late in the game so yeah, serious consequences
610,Thats not  sport friendly, there was no flag on the play I dont think a suspension is a likely thinng the Steelers won 28-21
611,I dont think so, theres no rule against that but I think its unlikely, what do you think?
612,Yeah I think it's unlikely.
613,What do you think about the 11 minutes of live gameplay?
614,I have the same thoughts, seems like an insult for fans and for viewers, too many adds, too many interruptions
615,I agree, it does take a long time, the NFL uses tracking chips
616,Yeah the chips in the footballs allows us to tell track, velocity, rotation, ball speed
617,I agree a lot of interesting stats, tech is taking over sports,
618,Yes I have! Did you know he actually came close to quitting football in order to pursue a competitive gaming career? Glad he didn't as I would guess football is much more lucrative!
619,That is true. But you know what really surprises me? I can't believe there's only one left handed QB in the NFL and that's Kellan Moore. I figured there'd be far more left handers!
620,Maybe so! I wonder if the deaf guy named Paul. D. Hubbard who created the circular huddles used today to keep opposing teams from reading his hand signals was left handed?
621,Indeed it is. Since we're on the subject of quarterbacks, do you like Tom Brady? I bet his old JV high team still kicks themselves to this day for refusing to start him when he was a backup despite never winning a game or scoring a touchdown that season. It's kind of sad, really.
622,It's a mystery, isn't it. But coaches sometimes make back decisions. I tell you what I often wonder is why we haven't had a female player drafted yet. Females are allowed to play as long as they meet the eligibility requirements, believe it or not!
623,Is there really? I mean, since the average game is only 11 minutes in terms of live gameplay, you'd think we would have at least seen a female kicker by now, right?
624,That is hard to believe and I can't believe lawsuits haven't been filed yet unless it's just some silly voodoo superstition or something? Either way, in terms of money, women would be better off becoming engineers since they make more than the average lifetime earnings of both MLB and NFL players anyway.
625,Hey, even crazier, back in the 1960s, the top bowlers made more than the top football players. That is so depressing considering how rough football is compared to how easy bowling is.
626,That is true and that yellow line is so innovative. I couldn't watch a game without it today! But thankfully people are more into football today as I couldn't see a bowler making more than Benjarvus Green-Ellis who's never fumbled the football in his entire pro career. That would be plain wrong!
627,I do like to watch college football. But I feel sorry for those teams who play Iowa at their stadium and have to sit in a pink lockerroom. I'm not sure if that's good or bad for the University of Iowa. Ha! What about you?
628,Im great. how are you? are you a football person?
629,I don't watch too often. I usually follow the NFL right around playoffs. did you watch the super bowl this year?
630,The patriots seem to always win. werent they called the Lannisters of the NFL?
631,LOL. Ok. i guess i usually root for the underdog. didnt the pats win last year too?
632,Um, doesnt brady have like a dozen rings or something? half a dozen?
633,yes, he also seems to have a unique diet. strawberry-less.
634,Why avocados? are they a vegan thing? he is a vegan right? is his wife?
635,i guess he sees the results and doesnt mind the taste. maybe you add salt or something? salsa? i wonder.
636,LOL. sorry. i got carried away. I guess i should control myself during the chats or i might disgust my partner. Sorry.
637,You flirted with tragedy there my friend. you need to be better prepared! does amazon do same-day delivery of beer on sundays? Plan for success!
638,Yeah, a lot of standing around and waiting waiting waiting. Anyway, great chat!
639,Yes I do. DO you know that Kellan Moore is the only left handed QB?
640,Yes I do, he is a good player, is he your favorite?
641,Wow their loss I guess. Brad Johnson once threw himself a touchdown shot
642,Exactly, that is why he is the only guy in history to have done that
643,Nice, he must be smart. Did you know Russell WIlson is still under contract though he is not playing regularly?
644,Great planner too. Snoop dog once wrote a song for his son's team
645,I wonder if that is supposed to have some effect on the players
646,I guess football was not that popular back in the day as bowling was
647,Wow what, when was that and who was playing?
648,WOw what a defeat . Nice chat
649,Hi! Is it the opposing players locker room that's painted pink or the players locker room? Why would they paint it pink?
650,Wonder if there's any actual effect or they just want to get in their minds. I have never followed Canadian football, I would imagine hockey is considered America's favorite sport instead of football. Don't think hockey is quite as big as it is in Canada?
651,Even basketball too especially for March Madness! Maybe Canada have women playing in their football leagues because there's no official written rule preventing female players from playing, but no one has yet met the physical requirements to my knowledge.
652,Does that still hold true, I'd imagine not since it seems as if football stars make a lot more than that and they make much more from endorsements too, if a bowler endorsed something, I don't think I would know them.
653,Unless the league factors in that they only average about 11 minutes of live gameplay so maybe it still does
654,Yes and yet I devote an entire afternoon to watching the games! The circular huddle that's used in games today was actually created by a deaf quarterback so the opposing team couldn't read his hand signals, he should've trademarked that!
655,That's not an easy feat consider people are literally chasing you when you possess the ball, wonder if he can negotiate a better salary with that stat.
656,Kellan Moore is the only left-handed quarterback, would the opposing team need to adjust their plays to accommodate that dexterity bias?
657,If only the superbowl was as entertaining as the 1916 Georgia tech game when they defeated Cumberland by 222-0, actually I think that'd be a pretty boring game as well.
658,Yeah, it really was but I still watched the whole thing. To my knowledge, I don't think the Rams or Patriots cheerleaders are treated like the Saints cheerleaders where they are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as the players.
659,hey I'm good, do you have a favorite quarterback?
660,ya he's good, I also like tom brady, Kellan Moore is interesting because he is left handed and the only quarterback like that
661,no I don't, I think hes a quarterback but thats all I know
662,wow he sounds really smart! what is weird is that only 2 black quarterbacks have ever won the superbowl, I wonder why
663,ah interesting! and ya apparenlty a quarterback threw a touchdown pass to himself, how is that possible?
664,wow thats impressive, also impressive that over half of the biggest world stadiums are all american football stadiums
665,ya I bet! Only 1 team has a snoop dogg song for their anthem, and that is snoop doggs son's team haha
666,ya it seems obvious but maybe it was a big tech breakthrew at the time, have you seen those huge american flags at football stadiums?
667,yup those, they cost 50k and are over 1000 pounds, thats nuts!
668,yup it does seem like a waste, did you hear about the tracking chips the nfl uses?
669,Not really.  I do kind of feel sorry for them.  Even with Joe Thomas, I wonder if they could turn things around.
670,I'm a Chiefs fan myself.  They do say the Thomas will soon be in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  Cold there?  It is here at 15 degrees and snow.
671,Well, I have some snow you can have.  I've been to Canton, OH but regret not going to the Hall of Fame.
672,I remember him.  A super Browns fan gave me a Browns cap on a flight I shared with her.  I guess she was a member of the Dog Pound.
673,Back in the day the Bills did well.  Was it the late 1980's?  Did you know that the NFL has no rules that women can't play?
674,Who was the QB?  I can picture him but can't think of the name... Did ya know that Kellan Moore is the only left-handed QB in the NFL?
675,I'm not sure.  I'm more of a football fan - my alma maters.   I played in HS and we used circular huddles.  I didn't know that originated for a deaf QB.
676,I started as a defensive back, safety and special teams.  Ah, the glory days. Funny, we didn't have any pink locker rooms for the visiting team but they did have to use the girls locker room.
677,Having played football in HS?  Nope, I'm a dude.  I went to Georgia Tech and I had no idea we beat poor Cumberland 222-0 in 1916.
678,That is terrible. I am grateful that ESPN created the superimposed yellow first down line.  That makes the game more exciting.
679,Thanks for the excellent chat!  Good luck to the Bills!
680,Terrelle Pryor did struggle quite a bit.
681,It seems like they have a lot of good prospects that were successful in college.  But they have been really lacking in that position for years
682,Maybe they just need a QB like Brad Johnson who once threw a touchdown pass, to himself.
683,It is kind of crazy that Brady didnt get that chance.  He really showed them!
684,Definitely.  Did you know there is only one left handed QB in the NFL
685,Kellan Moore.
686,Didnt he almost leave football for professional gaming?
687,I heard he thought he could beat everyone at his school, I have never played myself.
688,Did you know that the flags that span the field weigh 1,100 pounds and cost $50,000?
689,I wonder if there are just a few and they pass them around.  That is a lot of money, but they are also playing some of the players millions.
690,i like football. the player i hate the most is the quarterback
691,i like defense. defense is most important on the field. they must be the toughest, the roughest, the best.
692,i figure that a good coach knows the value of defense in stopping those pesky qbs. the QB is a target. the QB is a meal the QB is for eating.
693,I like sacking QBs! They never see it coming because they're behind the line.
694,is he a QB? who is he?
695,he probably should stick to video games. that is the safe bet. career is much longer.
696,the brain damage from video games is pretty bad too. i had a friend that played them too much. ended up about a simple as a retired player.
697,the brain is a fragile organ, not designed to withstand hours of banal stimulation and entertainment. there should be a warning label on games about cognitive impairment.
698,i have not heard that joke. whats the punchline?
699,oh, ok, that is cool. i thought you were telling a joke. he invented the huddle? the guy is a legend. anyway, great chat!
700,Well, I am not into football but I think I would be crazy to not say Payton Manning.
701,I like Tom Brady as well. His Super bowl wins are so impressive.
702,Yes, he once considered quitting football to game competitively.
703,It was created by a deaf quarterback who did not want the other team to read his hand signals. I like knowing the reason behind the traditions.
704,That sounds like an overpowered team having fun at the other teams expense.
705,Football has changed a lot over the years and is even very different in different countries. I like the way they play football in Canada.
706,They have a larger field in Canada. They also get ESPN in Canada and it is very popular.
707,Everyone loves the Patriots except those who have to compete next to them in the Super bowl. Was that Tom Brady who never fumbles the ball.
708,Oh, I should learn more names from the team. Are the Patriots your favorite team?
709,Apparently the average lifetime earning of an engineer is higher than the average NFL player.
710,If a woman could meet the requirements then they would be eligible. I can imagine that would be very difficult.
711,I saw they agreed to trade to draft picks to the Dolphins.
712,He had 112 catches last season. They also agreed to send a 3 round pick to the Bills.
713,Todd Haley will have a nice roster and plenty of potential.
714,Wouldn't that be awesome? They are wondering if Taylor was the right selection. He was benched in favor of a rookie.
715,Taylor's just the temporary starter quarterback. They could draft Sam Darnold or Josh Rosen.
716,He started the last three season and only has 51 touchdowns. I would be a little leary. There's always room for improvement.
717,He wasn't valuable to them anymore. They could get a new player who would pair well with the players.
718,Or what if they go with Penn State running back Saquon Barkley?
719,They wouldn't have their choice of quart backs.
720,The consultant to the Browns, Scot McCloughan like Mayfield.
721,He just has a presence about him like Lamar Jackson. People want to see him play because he all the great attributes.
722,DId you know that they use tracking chips in footballs and shoulder pads in the NFL?
723,They use it in footballs to track velocity, rotation, ball speed and location.  In the shoulder pads they record players every move on the field
724,If you visited iowa's locker room it is pink.
725,That is strange!  Former patriots rb benjarvus green-ellis never fumbled in the nfl!
726,Do you watch favorite football games on Thanksgiving?
727,Predictions were that the Cowboys would beat the Redskins.  The Jaguars were stated to be an unreliable team in the NFL.
728,Steelers Ben Roethlisberger ranks 8th in QBR
729,haha.  The huddle was created by a deaf quarterback to prevent his hand signals from being read
730,In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars
731,Also the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl and average mlb player
732,Hello! I am! are you?
733,Haha I am a Vikings fan! The Cowboys are fun to watch too! Can you believe there is only 11 minutes of actual gameplay?
734,Didn't that win an emmy for ESPN?
735,Oh nice! I wish they had footage of that game that was 222-0 in 1916!
736,That would have been a sight to see. A very sad sight lol. Do you have a favorite quarterback?
737,Oh gotcha! I think he's a good player but I wouldn't call him my favorite haha.
738,He didn't even put them in when they were doing absolutely terrible! Jokes on him I guess!
739,6 now actually lol. Do you ever think a girl will ever tryout for a team?
740,It really is! I would love to see it too! The Saints are sexist about their cheerleaders as well!
741,That is crazy! They need to update that like they do their technology! Anyways, it was great chatting with you!
742,Hello!  I follow football as much as I can. Probably equal parts college and the National Football League.  How about you?
743,I guess you might as well through in High School as well, especially if you are in Texas.  Allen,Texas, has a $60 million, 18 K seat high school stadium!
744,Tell me more about Cumberland.  Do they have a team anymore?
745,Wow.  It must be some sort of record.  Speaking of lovable losers, the Cleveland Browns returned to the NFL in 1999.  Despite playing eight home games per season, do you know who has the most wins in that stadium?  Opposing Steeler quarterback Ben Roethlsberger.
746,At least the weather is nicer.  Maybe you need a rocket science head coach.  Believe it or not, coach Matt Patricia actually is a rocket science!
747,He should get right on that. They spend so much money already.  Players and even the footballs have tracking devices that record every movement on the field.
748,I am sure part of it is to ensure they are getting the most out of their investments. I wonder how that works for Russell Wilson who hasn't played baseball since 2011, but is still on an MLB contract!
749,Amazingly he is also only one of two african-american quarterbacks to win a Super Bowl.  Doug Williams was the first.  Interestingly, they both got their wins over the Broncos.
750,Some big name quarterbacks for sure, but none may ever reach Brad Johnson who actually is the only QB to throw a TD pass to himself.  It must have been tipped!
751,The NFL has definitely come a long way since.  I mean, way back in 1932 the first playoff game was actually played on a dirt-field in a hockey stadium that was only 80 yards long.
752,I couldn't imagine a game without it and constantly have to remind myself the players can't see it!
753,Lol.  I wonder what she would think if she found out that those big American flags in the stadiums cost like $50 K and weigh about a ton!
754,I love it . Did you know U of Iowa painted the visitor locker room pink?
755,Good point. Bowlers made more in the 60s than football players
756,True. Do you know the highest score in a college football game
757,Yes and that was way back in 1916
758,Yes that was for the superimposed yellow line
759,Yeah true. Do you like Brady?
760,yes and they never started him even when they were doing really bad in the field
761,Yes I do, he is good at school too, finished college in two years
762,Yeah smart kid. Do you know who invented the circular huddle?
763,Yeah smart. It was nice chatting with you
764,Hello, I love the NFL. What about you?
765,This super bowl was so boring lol. Did you know Iowa painted the opposing team locker room pink?
766,Not too sure lol. The 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as the top football stars.
767,I agree. Bowling stars probably don't make much these days.
768,Most definitely. The highest score ever in a football game was 222-0.
769,That would be one very boring game to watch. I would have given up if I was on Cumberland.
770,I bet no one was still around lol. Green-Ellis went his entire football career without fumbling the ball.
771,I bet he had a lot because he was a starter. I remember watching him with the Bengals. I'm a Bengals fan.
772,I bet. Did you know the NFL uses tracking chips in players pads?
773,I hope so. They track ball speed, velocity, rotation, and location. Nice chatting with you!
774,Yes, it was good. the game started off slow until the fourth quarter.
775,No, I was sure who they were until I looked them up online, I think the lights and fire display help their performance.
776,I agree, I guess they painted it pink especially for visitors, in a way of speaking visiting teams are weak.
777,Yes that's  true, back in the 1960s the players weren't protective as they are today with padded helmets and so many penalty calls.
778,Wow, I wonder what kind of football team they were playing and what about the coach, what did he had to say?
779,Yes you are right and maybe I am wrong, but I think the coach wouldn't have any excuse to remain coaching that team.
780,I didn't know that either, never cross my mind, yes I can't imagine playing on a team without known where the first down marker.
781,I like football, i like college football better than pro football. my favorite team pittsburgh, what about you?
782,Forgot, you did tell me your team earlier, yes, people think that the Patriots won too many games Super Bowls, but not really, talent is talent, their sixth ring.
783,I don't think so, because the Patriots always had a smart coach, come from behind team and a calm quarterback.
784,Hey!  Yes I am a big NFL fan.  The Bears are my team!
785,Haha, my wife is a Vikings fan so I cheer for them too.  It is crazy to love a sport so much that only has 11 minutes of actual gameplay!
786,A lot of filler and cheerleaders!  Fun fact I recently learned about cheerleaders, the Saints forbid their cheerleaders from eating in the same restaurant as any of their players.
787,It is sexist for sure and wrong.  Interestingly enough, the NFL has no rule prohibiting female players!
788,That would be cool.  I know some college teams have had female kickers.  Colorado is the biggest school to have I believe.
789,That is some subtle gamesmanship!  I actually went to Maryland.  Our recent coordinator hire, Matt Canada, had to take over the coaching duties last year.
790,Yes, a very sad story all around.  Canada was pretty good last season.  He set school records at Pitt for his offensive production.
791,That is a crazy stat!  It is amazing how far football has come.  At one point in the 1960s the top bowlers were making double the top football stars!
792,That is shocking!  I wonder if some players are actually really smart like Alex Smith.  He had so many AP credits, he was able to enroll in college as a high school junior!
793,Nice chatting with you today too!
794,Hey, yeah I do.
795,No, really? I thought it was just for men.
796,That's cool. I hope to see a woman in the nfl one day. Do you think it's true Saints cheerleaders can't eat at the same restaurant as nfl players?
797,I know! That is insane.
798,I wonder how much engineers make because nfl players make a lot. Oh, I seen where the nfl uses tracking chips in player's pad and the footballs!
799,Yeah, I didn't know that. It makes sense how the announcer are able to view the replays and stuff.
800,Yeah, and everything else is commercials and replays.
801,No, I'm not sure, what is it?
802,That is insane! What teams?
803,Very boring, a complete blow out.
804,Yea, it's funny how the Redskins were able to blow the NFC east lead after winning over Dallas earlier in the season
805,That is pretty crazy, I remember Green-Ellis use to play for the Patriots, I don't think I've seen him fumble
806,Yea, I wonder if the nfl was able to find out how he did it with the tracking chips they put into player's equipment
807,Possibly, it's amazing how much info they can get when the game only averages 11 minutes of live gameplay
808,I don't know, I wonder if that was why top bowlers made twice as much as football players in the 1960s
809,I heard engineers make more than mlb players too, I guess paying attention in school pays off
810,I suppose so, I bet cumberland had a team full of engineers when they lost to Georgia tech 222-0
811,Yea, tv wasn't even around back then but now we got yellow first down lines winning emmys
812,That's pretty crazy but not as crazy as deaf quarterback Paul D. Hubbard
813,Hubbard invented the huddle just to do so using hand signals
814,You too, have a good one
815,Not usually, but I do keep an eye on the NFL when it gets near the playoffs
816,I can understand that being a state level law though with how much money Nevada's government probably makes. The trends would be hard to predict though
817,Definitely! I'd much rather watch the game for enjoyment than bet my money on anything. I went to a few high school games back in the day. Their fight song wasn't nearly as cool as the one Snoop Dogg would have written for his son's team
818,Probably not, but there may not be a way to find out for sure. Quarterbacks typically make enough to not need side money. I guess it pays to be the leader of the offensive team if you make it to the NFL
819,It might if you have all the expensive ESPN channels. Football has become a big deal over the decades though, to the point that there's a stadium in Texas that seats 18,000 and cost $60 million to build. The most shocking part is that it's a high school stadium
820,It sure is helpful in watching the games though. They spend $50,000 for the huge American flags at football stadiums. In addition, it takes a lot to lift all 1,100 of the flag
821,I'm not sure. I wonder if all the stadiums have them. Of the largest stadiums, 14 of 25 are for college teams
822,It would be a risk to get tackled. The only professional football I see girls playing is association football, also known as soccer
823,Engineering is another field that has a sparse number of women (pun intended). Have you ever heard of the quarterback Brad Johnson?
824,Not only did he win the Super Bowl, but he's also the only quarterback to throw a touchdown pass to himself
825,No, but he does have six Super Bowl rings. There's only one quarterback in the NFL who is left handed
826,I do, I dont follow too closely though, you?
827,I heard about that.  Personally, I think its a bit childish, but whatever works for them
828,That is shocking, I wonder what the pay was back then?  I didnt realize bowling was ever that popular.
829,It really is, but not as amazing as Benjarvus Green-Ellis, who have never fumbled the football.
830,Yeah, of course he was on the Patriots too
831,WOW!  I cant believe one team could  score that many points!
832,Not if you were a GA tech fan.  lol
833,Yeah, that sees so little for the amount of time it takes to actually watch a game.
834,I heard the ball has them too!  That is so cool!
835,I hope they can use that data to also improve player safety.
836,I love watching it!  I watch all 17 weeks during the regular season.
837,I did not. But it makes sense.  There is only 1 left handed QB in the NFL - Kellan Moore.
838,I can only remember Michael Vick being a left handed QB.  I'm sure there were some more at some point.
839,I didn't.  Tell me more about it?
840,I wonder if we will see a female player any time soon.  There is no written rule against them playing in the NFL.
841,I agree!  Did you know that the average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay?
842,I know.  That's what I thought.  Did you know that the circular huddle was created by a deaf QB so that the other team couldn't see his hand signals?
843,hahaha right!  Baker Mayfield almost quit football to pursue a full time competitive gaming career.  I would never do that.
844,I agree.  Are you familiar with the QB Alex Smith?
845,I agree.  I think he will be back in time for next season.  I was suprised at how educated he is.  He took so many ap tests in high school it allowed him to enter college as a junior.  He then got his bachelor's degree in 2 years!
846,Yes, I go to the games! Do you? What do you think of Baker Mayfield?
847,Patriots and the Bucanneers!  Did you know there is no rules that women can play football in the NFL?
848,I know Maybe a kicker would be okay!  What teams do you watch?
849,Oh I see, okay, Thinking only if she's a very strong girl! lol At least she wouldn't get hurt. Did you know there is only one left handed quarterback? Kellan Moore
850,I guess not, A deaf quarterback created the huddle, so they couldn't read his hand signals.
851,Do you know who RB Bejarvus Green-Ellis is?
852,Hes is so talented he has never fumbled the football in his NFL career.
853,lol, right! Have you played Halo 3?
854,Very little, QB Baker Mayfield claims he can beat anyone at the University of Oklahoma.
855,Yes, its been interesting.
856,You too! Good chat!
857,I am a fan of neither. Are you a fan?
858,I guess that's a part of football that I will never understand. Why run the ball when you can throw it oh so very far?
859,I guess that is true, but what is the running person bobbles the ball? I've heard that bobbling is a big error in the football.
860,I guess he has big hands then? Does he wear special gloves? He must be the best ball runner in the history of NFL?
861,He is a miracle man. He must teach his secret technique to the others.
862,He could use the ESPN networks to share the knowledge! That is the greatest of ideas! He will be a hero to the many running men in the league!
863,ESPN, is that the Spanish network? ESPaNol or something? I don't really speak spanish so I don't know them.
864,I guess the lines are important to the game. I figure the running man with the big hands carrying the ball can benefit greatly from the Line of the First Down.
865,I guess it is a way to a football career. Start as a bowler, make the money, then become the football player. The ball is heavy in bowling so the hands get big for become the running ball man!
866,The bowlers use the tracking chips to find their way to the ball? What are the tracking chips for?
867,Hi there!
868,That's too funny.  Are you excited about Super Bowl weekend?  Not sure who to root for.  Was initially thinking the Seahawks might make it this year.
869,Ha!  I know what you mean.  (Did you read about that kid who did a science fair project that proved Tom Brady's a cheater?)   But yeah, Andrew Luck has a pretty good year considering his surgery.
870,Marlon Mack, also coming back form injury did a lot to help the Colts out as well.  Man they had a good team this year.
871,Yeah, I read that.  It's pretty amazing that it's only 11 minutes.  But just taking a look at the Super Bowl, it does seem like more commercials than anything else.  Wonder what the first Super Bowl was like.  Think that was in 1966.
872,Yeah, but you know what I find interesting during the game.  Call me a geek but I like that superimposed yellow line representing the 1st down.
873,Heck yeah, they deserve an Emmy for that.  Keeps me interested and focused.  Guess ESPN and the NFL need to find ways to keep viewers.  All about the business/money I guess.  Gotta pay those athletes right?
874,Yeah, weird.  I had heard that the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player.  Ha!  Guess I can tell that to my daughter.  Not that she'd play in the NFL.
875,Ha!  Yeah, that's not in our family genes.  She's more of a cheerleader type.
876,Someone told me though, New Orleans Saints cheerleader aren't allowed to eat in the same restaurant as any NFL player.
877,Hi! Yes, did you watch the recent Superbowl game?
878,I think that's how long actual game play is! It was a very dull game in my opinion. I was ready for some action, like edge of seat tiebreaker but was a bit disappointed.
879,I think women can play, at least it's not against the NFL rules, but I have yet to think of any women who can meet the physical requirements for eligibility. Do you know how many pounds you have to be at least in order to play?
880,Yeah, it could be. The NFL's actually the highest professional level of American football in the world, I don't think I've ever heard of them drafting players from other countries like they do for other sports.
881,No, what's the rule for the New Orleans cheerleaders?
882,what?! there seems to be some gender disparity treatment with that rule. I think they should revisit that rule and change it, I wonder why that is, do you know?
883,That's a little overboard, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that there is something wrong with that rule. Speaking of rocket scientist, Matt Patricia who is a coach in the NFL was actually a rock scientist before he started coaching for the NFL!
884,To remind the players to be tough and play tough! I don't know, I'm just taking a wild guess since the NFL uses tracking chips to record the players every move on the field.
885,No who is that? That is an odd first name though, I wonder if his nickname is Ben or something because that is definitely not a common first name!
886,Never fumbled? That is an amazing feat! That almost ties with the accomplishment of Brad Johnson who is the only quarterback in NFL history to throw a touchdown pass to himself!
887,Yes I do. Did you know that women can play?
888,Yeah as long as they meet the requirements they are good to go
889,Yes and yet we are glued to the tv for hours watching one game
890,True. Did you hear of that rule for Saints cheerleaders?
891,Yeah, and worst, they have to leave mid meal if the players walk in
892,I agree. Do you like Brady?
893,Yes and he was not started even when they were doing really bad
894,Yes he is a great player and super smart, finished college in two years
895,Yeah such a well rounded kid. Do you know who invented the circular huddle?
896,Yeah smart one. Nice chatting with you
897,Hi!  I do watch football... I used to be a big St. Louis Rams fan, but since they moved to Los Angeles I am no longer a fan.  I still play fantasy football every year, which keeps me engaged with the rest of the league.  I also enjoy college football a lot too.  How about you?
898,My all-time favorite players were some of the Rams old players like Kurt Warner, MArshall Faulk, and Isaac Bruce.  Nowadays, I really enjoy watching Patrick Mahomes play.  He was my quarterback on my fantasy team so I saw many of his games and highlights.  He is incredibly exciting and it's nice to see new young talent injected into the league.  Aaron Rodgers is also very fun to watch, but unfortunately, I think his best may be behind him.  How about you?  Any favorite teams or players?
899,Absolutely!  There are no rules that prevent women from being in the NFL.  Do you think a woman will ever play in the NFL?
900,I think the first time we see a woman play in the NFL will be as a kicker.  Kickers don't have to tackle and take hits like the rest of football players do.  However, I could see a very strong woman actually attempt to play a different position.
901,I feel like I've heard about it, but I can't remember the details... can you give me the rundown?
902,That's really weird... what is the reasoning behind this?  I will admit, the NFL is an extremely poor run "organization."  Lots of corruption, dishonesty, and unethical behavior.  Teams, such as the New Orleans Saints are also pretty unethical.
903,That is very degrading to the cheerleaders.   It's not like there are safety concerns or anything... They're in a public place.  I can understand they not wanting the players and cheerleaders alone together, but it seems like there is a very small chance of something bad happening.  Seems like the players just have a superiority complex.
904,If I remember correctly, each quarter is 15 minutes long and there are 4 quarters to a game.  Did you watch any of the Super Bowl last week?
905,Yeah, it's pretty pathetic, haha.  There is a couple seconds of action and then several minutes of standing around.  It can still be very exciting at times though; much more than some other sports.  Baseball is pretty bad with a lack of action and lots of standing around.
906,Good, they don't deserve to make as much as engineers.  Engineers actually do something productive for society.  NFL players play a game and then generally don't contribute much to society.
907,I do sometimes. How about you?
908,I know and that seems crazy knowing how long a game actually is.
909,Another crazy thing is the Saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating  in a restaurant with any nfl player. If they are already eating and players walk in they have to leave. That must be an old time rule.
910,I don't know it just doesn't seem fair, but what is cool is that there is no law prohibiting a woman from playing in the NFL if she meets requirements.
911,And I am left handed and I find it pretty cool that Kellan Moore is the only left handed quarterback in the NFL.
912,Hey it makes him unique and makes him stand out
913,Some football stuff I find funny, like the university of Iowa's visiting locker room being pink. They must hate being in there
914,They probably do. And did you know that Benjarvus green ellis never fumbled a ball in his NFL career. That is awesome.
915,He must be hated by the opposing team for sure.
916,That seems crazy but you don't see a lot of bowling anymore. Did you know the highest score in a football game was 222-0. How is that even possible.
917,Im great do you like football?
918,I do as well my favorite team is in the AFC, what about yours?
919,I like the Patriots, I guess we are tied in Superbowl winds as of a Sunday ago.
920,I didnt know about that, I guess its logical not to let them play, men tend to be a lot stronger and it wouldnt be fair
921,Yeah that would be different and would be a great fit for the team for sure, I think football is a great sport 32 teams, 16 in each division and each of them with great players
922,I didnt, that doesnt seem like a lot, I guess ads take over the screem, whats your favorite position?
923,I like the QB position, Im guessing you know who Tom Brady is?
924,It is funny I guess the coach never knew what he had on the bench until years later when he saw him play.
925,Yea I agree its not common to have a hall of famer in your team and never use him, he did lose almost everygame that season
926,Really? Only one? whats his name?
927,Oh Kellan Moore, he is a great player, imagine being a football player and loosing by 222 points? well that happened back in 1916 poor Cumberland
928,I  agree, something was up in that game, football is a game with a lot of interesting facts and stats, you know ESPN won an emmy because of football
929,I think they did, the yellow line has changed football forever, it sounds like something simple but its has change things for sure
930,Its been nice chatting as well
931,You too bye, and good luck to the Steelers this season
932,Yes I do. Did you know that women can play in the NFL too?
933,Yes me too probably it is supposed to have some effect on the other team
934,Yes I guess football was not that popular of a sport as bowling was back then
935,Yes that was 222-0, quite the game and do you know who was playing?
936,It was Georgia Tech that beat Cumberland in 1916
937,Yes to be honest it has made game watching much easier now
938,that sure is. Alex SMith also finished college in two years, and is a great player
939,I know right? He still claims that he is great at Halo 3 and can beat anyone at U of Oklahoma
940,yes it certainly feels like forever. Do you know who invented the circular huddle?
941,Same here, have a good one
942,I do, I'm a big Bills fan.
943,Their quarterback situation has always made me mad, but they've done good with Josh Allen in his rooking season.
944,They weren't the worst with their 6-10 record. They ended up 3rd in their conference behind the Patriots and Dolphins. If they can make some moves this offseason to get some linemen to protect him and a receiver or two they'll be doing really good.
945,Yeah it was a risk, they had already picked up a quarterback in the last draft and alot of fans were perturbed about it. I really wanted them to stick with Tyrod Taylor, who got them into the playoffs the year before, but they traded him to the Cleveland Browns.
946,I did in high school, but now only on Playstation.
947,I wonder why no women have tried to play in the NFL. With the way some teams treat their cheerleaders I can see why they wouldn't want to.
948,That is so unfair. Even if they're already dining in the restaurant and a NFL player comes in they are required to leave. I wonder why?
949,I'm going to have to research this. I'm intrigued. I mean the players on play on average for 11 minutes, I'm sure the cheerleaders are more active than that. They should be held at higher regard.
950,Apparently it's league wide with ridiculous rules. That's horrible. Did you know that average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an NFL player?
951,I'm guessing the average NFL player isn't in the league that long and most engineers don't retire until they're in their 60s.
952,They do, the average pay is like $1.7M and the average length of career is around 3 years. I think Engineers on average are around $100,000-150,000 so I guess they can catch up once the NFL player is out of the league.
953,I've enjoyed it too, I hope you have a great evening!
954,Did not know that. Did you know Brady was a back up QB in high school?
955,Yeah, their loss I guess. Did you know Alex SMith wrapped up college in two years?
956,Yes and then got started on his masters before he was picked on the 2005 draft
957,Yes he claims that he is super good at Halo 3 and can beat anyone at U of Oklahoma to it
958,Could be, you never know. Do you know who invented the circular huddle?
959,Yeah and he was deaf himself so that was genius on his behalf
960,I wonder too. I do not think I have heard of anyone trying for it at least.
961,Yeah. Did you know that there are only 11 minutes of active game play during a game?
962,Good point. What do you think of that rule where Saints cheerleaders cannot eat in the same place as the players?
963,I agree completely with you there. On a different note, they are using tracking chips on the players during games now
964,I do, I love football, what about you?
965,I didnt, it does seem unfair, football is a game of strengh and men tend to be stronger.
966,That fact is a bit odd, only 11 minutes of gameplay? thats not much, noth much at all
967,I didnt know that but it does make sense, engineers work for a long time football players have short careers.
968,I did, that rule is so unfair and sexist, I hate it, the Saints should change that immediately,
969,That is the worst part, did you hear about the tracking chips footballs have,?
970,That would be a great use of the data, football can be a risky game full with injuries, a lot of the players end up with brain damage
971,I didnt, why did ESPN win an Emmy award? I though Emmys were only for the music business I guess I was mistaken
972,I guess that was a really important contribution to the game not sure if it deserved an Emmy though,
973,No maybe 80 to 7? or 120 to 3? I have no idea, Im just guessing here,
974,I catch it when I can, mainly into college ball.  How about you?
975,It does, I think it is because you are playing solely for pride.
976,Like painting a locker room pink.  lol
977,Really?  I guess you would have to be near it to know.  here in Florida UF and FSU can get pretty heated.
978,Yeah.  I went to FSU so I am a bit invested, but honestly dont care too much.
979,It is fascinating indeed  I think it could be used to prevent injury too and develop better safety equipment.
980,I think they have started some work on things like that with the placement of the inner padding.
981,That would be great!  I cant blame females for not running at the chance to play in the NFL with they way the treat the cheerleaders.
982,Very true, the requirements might be prohibitive themselves.
983,I wonder if it is like that all around the league?
984,For real.  I dont know what could have happened to spur a rule like that.
985,It does, but then there are some like Alex Smith who just lead the charge and stick around to get a masters.
986,It does, so many players go broke 5 years after they retire, something like 60%
987,Like being an engineer you will make more in a lifetime, you have to work longer, but you make a lot more overall.
988,I haven't seen or heard too much about him.  Hes up with Washington right?
989,Wow.  I think it is great that there are a bunch of good up and coming players.
990,I dont watch too much, there is only 11 minutes of live action.  I dont have time to spend 3 hours watching a game for 11 minutes.
991,They dont treat cheerleaders well, so I dont imagine that they would treat female players well either.
992,It really does, I wonder why that rule exists, or if it is even enforeced.
993,I know few.  None that are paid that highly, but it is cool that engineers have that earning potential.
994,I think it is a bit childish and in a way toxic.
995,It is leaders like him and Brady that really make that team what it is.  I doubt anyone else will ever be able to do that.
996,Yeah, it is hard to believe.  How can you even score that many 222, that explains why the other team had 0
997,Cumberland must have forgotten to get off the bus.. lol
998,Not so much...are you a big fan of football yourself?
999,Quarterbacks are one of the most popular players for football it seems. I cannot name any off the top of my head though. Can you?
1000,I think it's interesting that Matt Patricia is a coach for football but yet he is also a rocket scientist. Really, how does he have time for football?
1001,That would make my day if I learned football would be a more lucrative profession than rocket scientist. What is the world coming to?
1002,That's true...although coaches and owners seem to be in the permanent safe zone! Did you know that Snoop Dogg wrote a fight song for his son's football team?
1003,Well, that football team is one of the luckiest around to be involved with Snoop Dogg. I don't think they needed to do much fundraising for equipment at that school!
1004,Wow a football player that NEVER fumbles the ball? That sounds like some sort of football god. Is he a quarterback?
1005,Running back, quarterback, tight end. Those are about the only football positions I know...the last one sounds pretty funny, actually.
1006,Even as hard as they try, in football or any other sport it can be hard to call. There is always human error. Differences of opinion, too, I bet...
1007,Was that so the football players on the other team or other people couldn't see what the quarterback was signing? That's very clever, if so!
1008,Hey there. Yes the NFL is an awesome organization. I watch the Super Bowl this year it was held on the first Sunday in February. But it wasn't that good of a game I thought.
1009,Yeah that was one of the worst no calls I have ever seen. Truly terrible. NFL uses tracking chips and players shoulder pads but they can't even review a call? Not OK.
1010,Yeah I definitely think the NFL should adopt that. They have no written rule against female players so why not have a referee on camera too.
1011,Yeah I agree with you there. I remember the former patriots running back green ELLIS he never once fumbled the football.
1012,I hope your team does well in the future you guys definitely deserve it. I am also glad Baker Mayfield didn't pursue his competitive gaming dream. He makes a better football player I think.
1013,Yeah well hopefully that will change LOL. Sometimes I forget that there are 32 teams in the NFL because we only hear about the same teams every year.
1014,I know it is very annoying. I really wish they didn't win the Super Bowl again. I would've really like to see the New Orleans saints win this year.
1015,Well it was a smart bet and I hope it paid off for you. It's kind of interesting that the New Orleans Saints cheerleaders can't be at the same restaurant as any NFL player.
1016,I completely agree with you. Sometimes I would rather watch them in the game. Surprisingly though the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings of an NFL player and an average MLB player.
1017,Yeah I agree with you. The football players just get injured too often which is surprising because there's actually only 11 minutes of live gameplay per game.
1018,I sure do. Snoop Dogg once wrote a song for his son's team
1019,I wonder if that is supposed to have some impact on them
1020,Wow cool.  The coaches are the highest paid ever though in the states
1021,I am not sure, what game was that?
1022,Wow what a score. Did you know Kellan Moore is the only left handed QB in the NFL?
1023,I like him, he is good. Do you know Brad JOhnson?
1024,Wow a backup? Brad is the only guy to have thrown himself a touchdown ball
1025,Me either. Only two african-american players have won the superbowl
1026,Wow. Did you know the NFL is using tracking chips now?
1027,They are collecting velocity and rotation and a bunch of other stuff
1028,Hello,  No I didn't.  You keep up with football a lot?
1029,I read that too crazy!  Nfl uses tracking chips embedded in players shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field. they are also located inside footballs to track: velocity, rotation, ball speed and location.
1030,That's really considerate!
1031,Maybe bowling was much more popular back then. Matt patricia is the only rocket scientist coaching in the nfl. before coaching, he was a working aeronautical engineer who graduated from rpi: a school whose fight song includes "sin", "cosine" and "tangent", as well as six digits of pi.
1032,lol must be some sort of strategy or something,
1033,Yeah! The first nfl playoff game was played in 1932 on an 80-yard long dirt field inside chicago stadium, then home to the nhl blackhawks.
1034,Nice,  I wonder why that guy isn't that popular,  never heard of him.
1035,wow!  Snoop dogg wrote a fight song for his son's high school football team.
1036,Wow that's impressive! Those humungous American flags at football stadiums weigh 1,100 pounds and cost $50,000 to make
1037,That's unfortunate.  14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums belong to American college football teams.
1038,Does Gonzaga play quarterback for St Johns?
1039,I see. Then you probably know I do not watch high school football!  I really don't even watch the NFL. Do you?
1040,I hear that ruby is a variation of football. It's even literally called rugby football in places.
1041,Sorry, meant Rugby, not ruby! I hear some of the stadiums have flags that weigh over half a ton. I wonder if they've ever fallen?
1042,I didn't, was it a very high score? I know it's a high price to build a football stadium. I've heard just a high school one can be sixty million!
1043,I like bowling more than playing football. One reason is that I like how you can practice alone because for football it's always teamwork, but bowling can be done alone.
1044,I guess it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it was the best. I agree that schools spend too much on elaborate stadiums. Out of the 25 largest stadiums in the World, 14 are at American Colleges. I wonder what their food is like?
1045,I think they did it for just a joke, or I hope so. I know Snoop Dogg has a son that plays football. Have you ever seen him play?
1046,I haven't heard it, I will! I think quarterbacks tend to be popular players in football, although I'm not even sure what they do.
1047,I've heard that Kellan Moore is a famous quarterback in the NFL known for being left handed. He's the only one like that, it seems.
1048,I love it. Did you know women can play too?
1049,Yeah if they meet the requirements they are good to play
1050,Yes it is actually only 11 minutes in total
1051,Yeah I know. Did you hear of the rule for the Saints cheerleaders?
1052,Yeah and they also have to leave mid meal if they walk in
1053,I agree Did you hear they are using chips on the players now
1054,I hope they can use that to make the game safer somehow
1055,I do. He was a back up QB in high school
1056,Yeah their loss. DO you like Alex SMith?
1057,Yes took lots of AP tests in college and managed to do that
1058,Hello there, I do follow the NFL, did you watch the SuperBowl this year?
1059,Yeah I kind of fell asleep at the end, but I woke up and saw I had won some money so I was happy.  Do you have a favorite NFL team?
1060,Yeah I think that is super cool, I really want a female player to make a team and play and the field soon.  I think it would be so great for all the young girls into sports.  And I follow the Packers.
1061,Yeah isn't that hilarious.  I wonder how they got the ok for that to get painted in the first place.
1062,That is so funny, oh if I could have a choice to do it again, I would be a top bowler in the 60's.  I would have the life then.
1063,Yeah I heard they won it years back when they came out with the yellow line shown for the first down line.
1064,Wasn't it a crazy score of over 200-0? I think I read about that one time.
1065,I heard that. What was his name, I don't remember but know he played for the Patriots.
1066,Yeah that is amazing.  Do you know when the first NFL playoff game was held?
1067,It was way back in 1932! In Chicago stadium, and the field was basically dirt and only 80 yards long.  It was the same place the blackhawks played!
1068,I'll probably watch it.  Are you? You know, the nfl doesn't have any rules against a woman playing.
1069,I didn't know that either.  Next game i'm going to watch to see if that is true.  I do know, though, that there is only 16 regular season games.
1070,Well, there is if you count playoffs and preseason.  Oh, and each time has a bye week.  My favorite position is either quarterback or wide receiver.  You?
1071,I've never heard of him.  I'm old school and have to admit that my favorite running back was Tony Dorsett back in the day.  But now, as far as talent goes, there's some good players out there.  Baker Mayfield for example.  He's so talented at stuff he could even do professional video game playing!
1072,Yep.  I like multifaceted players.  Alex Smith for example is reported to be very smart.  He was working on a master's degree before being drafted.
1073,I think so too.  Football can be inspiring like that.  I mean, Tom Brady was a second string quarterback in high school and now look!
1074,I agree.  I wonder what will happen with the Patriots when he retires.  The quarterback is the leader of the team and they don't seem to have a good replacement in place.
1075,Knowing that, teams need really good quarterbacks.  Did you know that Kellan Moore is the only left handed one?
1076,That is crazy! I would have loved to see that game! I bet neither team had any defense at all!
1077,Maybe the home team should have tried to psych their opponent out like the University of Iowa does. They have the visitors locker room painted pink.
1078,You too brah. Do you watch football? The NFL has 32 teams, the NY Giants are my favorite team
1079,I'm from Connecticut, right next to NY. We don't have any of the 16 teams from the NFC or AFC in my state unfortunately
1080,I wonder if European Football uses tracking chips like how the NFL embeds them into shoulder pads
1081,I guess the NFL uses them to track the players movements and they also have them in the ball to track velocity, rotation, speed, and location
1082,Usually in the pros once you break into the 40s its consider really high, in College there will be a game once in a while that breaks into the 60's or 70s
1083,Yea, It must of been the best team in College football at the time facing another college that's team had the skill equivalent of a high school team
1084,If the games are close in score they tend to fun to watch, if it's one-sided and you're not a fan of the high scoring team then no, that's why I don't really like college football 90% of the games aren't competitive
1085,Not really, back in the 60s football wasn't as popular and there was no unions, players during the offseason worked regular job
1086,Head games I guess. Did you know 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums belong to american college football teams?
1087,Yea, kinda a shame sports are more important than academics, The highest paid across all u.s. department of defense employees are three football coaches of the service branch teams.
1088,You too, have a good one
1089,Yes i do... very much!  Do you?
1090,He seems pretty good so far!  Who's you're favorite team out the 32 teams in the NFL?
1091,That's cool... i like them... although payton's faces are pretty funny!  I am an Eagles fan.
1092,Yeah... be nice to have a consistent quarterback!  I can't believe Kellen Moore is the only left handed QB!
1093,So i wonder when we will see a female player in the NFL?
1094,So true!  What position you think she will play?
1095,i was thinking more like a kicker.
1096,Crazy isn;t it?  You ever heard of that before being a saints fan?
1097,Extremely unfair... they need to change that rule... it's very rude!
1098,Oh yeah... for sure!  How about we sit around for 3 hours watching a game for only 11 total minutes of live gameplay... we muct be crazy!
1099,Doing well thanks. How about you?
1100,I follow it some. Do you think there will ever be a women playing in the NFL?
1101,I think there will be, I'm all for it if they can do it. Did you know the average NFL game only has 11 minute of live action?
1102,Yeah, and also think about how many hours of practice they go through for just 11 minutes.
1103,I'm sure. I can't believe they didn't stop that game.
1104,Maybe. If I was on the team that had their locker room painted I would retaliate by shutting off the Hawkeyes hot water.
1105,In the 60's I would have rather been a football player. Today I have more sense. How about you?
1106,I can see your point. What do you think about the tracking chips the NFL uses?
1107,Well, Tom Brady could how many times the football rotated and then let some air out.
1108,Ha, right. I have to give Brady credit, no matter what else he has had quite a career.
1109,Yeah it does, I know it still has the highest tv ratings of all of our major sports.
1110,I think that would be so cool if a female player did make a pro team.  To young girls into sports it would be huge as well.
1111,Isn't that pretty crazy, doesn't seem like anything, but there are tons of stops in the game.
1112,That is true and there wasn't nearly the amount of focus and attention to injuries as there are now.  Especially all of the stuff on concussions.
1113,Yeah I think when you add it up those engineers make more because they work for a much longer time, but I could be wrong.
1114,I wonder how many years Tom has left in him.  I would say he has won enough.
1115,Speaking of football, do you know what the highest scoring game ever was?
1116,Good call! Yeah it sounds like the defense didn't show up that at all, or the offense I guess.
1117,That is some stat, to be a pro running back and never had a fumble, that is impressive.
1118,That is pretty funny that whoever is in charge at that school gave the ok for them to paint it that way.
1119,I'm not a big fan - don't know a lot about football. I know he is a player for the Cowboys.
1120,Yeah that is odd. Also odd that New Orleans Saints cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as an NFL player. Very strange.
1121,Wow that's really surprising. I know they bring in the money now. Even though an engineer still earns more in a lifetime than an NFL or MLB player on average.
1122,Haha yeah and they track the football itself too!
1123,Yeah I was kind of surprised to learn that. I'm sure it will come up at some point. I wonder if it hasn't happened yet because women aren't aware of this or because they fail to meet league eligibility requirements.
1124,Yeah it can definitely do some damage playing football.
1125,That's something I would like to see. I guess that is supposed to mess with the opposing team before the game haha
1126,That's pretty impressive. Also interesting that Kellan Moore is the only left handed quarterback in the nfl.
1127,Also pretty interesting that the circular huddle was created by hubbard, a deaf quarterback, so the other team couldn't read his hand signals. Pretty smart and the huddle has stuck with the sport.
1128,Yes that is very true. Well it has been nice talking to you.
1129,Goodbye.
1130,i did not know that! i guess espn discovered something that people needed all along.
1131,it help understand just how close the team is to a first down. sometimes its not clear. i figure that GT did not need to do that to poor cumberland.
1132,i would love to see it too. and talk to the person that decided to do that. does it have any effect? i wonder
1133,i guess there is a LOT of standing and waiting and the officials conferring and stuff. great pay for all that waiting LOL
1134,i think it is good to understand how the game works. i would like to improve player safety. i think the chips might help there.
1135,Yes, they could help understand situations when players get hurt. maybe understand how to minimize risk of injury.
1136,i would expect that some positions could be open to women,like kicker or punter. but there is pipeline of male talent.
1137,yes, it is sexist and misogynistic. the cheerleaders are adults. they can be with the players in a public space.
1138,i dont know why that rule was started. there must have been a problem like romantic relationships or something.
1139,i guess some people should become gamers because they dont have other sports to play. but he had a choice. that is an easy one to make in my mind.
1140,i guess they can, but how long is the career? Football can lead to many things. Anyway, great chat!
1141,Hello, im great, so do you follow the NFL or college football?
1142,I follow both, have you seen Virginia Tech play lately?
1143,I see, well it seems like the defense needs a complete make over, they have a terrible defense hopefully the team can get better this year.
1144,I think they had a good campaign in 2017, I think there performance wasnt as good on 2018, so do you have a favorite NFL team?
1145,I see, too bad they didnt make it to the Superbowl this year, when was the last time the bears made it?
1146,that sounds like it was a great game indeed lol, its amazing how tech advances and now we can tell different data like the velocity, the rotation of the ball among others with the use of a simple chip.
1147,I dont Im not a big tennis fan, more a soccer or football fan myself
1148,I agree although players have also chips and I think that is really advanced.
1149,I can see your point, you know there is a high school football stadium that had a cost of 60 million dollars, what a waste of money!!
1150,Hopefully it didnt come out of drug money, we waste enormous amount of money on stadium we have 14 of the biggest stadiums on the world on a list of 25
1151,I'm great great, how are you? Yes I love watching football and that blows my mind to think since we sit and watch a game for hours!
1152,That would be a great day for society! I wonder what position she would try out for, kicker?
1153,Imagine getting a steak and then having to leave because somebody came in. That is crazy to me! I do like the NFL technology though!
1154,Players can have their every move tracked on the field as well! ESPN even won an emmy for that yellow line we see on the field haha.
1155,Isn't he the only left handed quarterback in the league right now? The only others ones I can think of are Brunell, Steve Young, and Michael Vick!
1156,I'm sure he's happy he changed his mind. If he keeps it up, he'll be making much much more than he would have playing video games!
1157,I guess if they take all the players that only play one or two years into that average, I do believe engineers in fact make more in their lifetime!
1158,I think I would have loved being a bowler back then, but yet again, how much is more for payment back then?
1159,That is a crazy stat because he played in the league for years! These days, it's common for a running back to fumble like every other game! I wonder how many fumbles were in the 222-0 game back in 1916 lol.
1160,I think I would have just walked off the field at that point. It was nice chatting with you as well!
1161,I love watching football, how about you?
1162,I like the vikings and the university of iowa for college, you?
1163,I like underdog teams too. Did you ever hear about Iowa and their pink locker room for their opponents?
1164,I think they use pink for psychology purposes, not sexism. It is a natural calming color and it is used to relax the other team
1165,I did not know that, I wonder why there hasn't been a women playing before, not even a kicker
1166,I heard that, that is sexism 101! I wonder why no one has taken them to court over that. Now is the time to end that
1167,Right, that is not cool at all. Let them enjoy their meals!
1168,That is true things need to change. Did you hear about tracking chips in shoulder pads for players now?
1169,Maybe they were created because of that lol! I bet they were created by engineers who make more money in their lifetime than most nfl players
1170,For sure, I should have dreamed to be an engineer as a kid! It was so nice chatting with you!
1171,For sure, have a great weekend and enjoy your day!
1172,I do to, but don't really follow the NFL...but wish I could!
1173,Really? That's cool. I wonder if there will ever be any female players in the NFL, like maybe a quarterback! Haha
1174,I agree! Being forbidden to eat in the same place as they do is ridiculous. They even have to leave if they were there 1st! Football can have some crazy rules even outside of the game.
1175,Oh, gotcha. Yes it is definitely insane if you ask me. Very humiliating! I do like how the university of Iowa painter the locker room pink for visitors haha, crazy!
1176,Wow, didn't know that, but I agree! It would make sense! There was a Patriot's player who never fumbled the football in his NFL career...if they were tracking maybe that would change! I bet he was an excellent player though.
1177,Exactly! So do you have a favorite team or player in the NFL? I like the quartebacks,they are such an important part of the game.
1178,I gotta stay with my home team QB, Josh Rosen...I know, they are not the best but hey, I love them.
1179,They have had there moments! Is he the guy that got his bachelor's degree in 2 years? And became the 1st overall pick in the 2005 NFL draft?
1180,Wow, I do remember that. Very smart to get that education. Just like Baker Mayfield....he is an excellent video game player. He even considered quitting football to play video games!
1181,Right! Those players get beat up some games. Isn't Kellan a QB?
1182,I love football. Glad the playoffs are here but sad the season is drawing to a close too
1183,That is true. Who do you think will be representing the AFC and NFC in the Super Bowl this year.
1184,Are you a fan of either  team?
1185,I hope to see one at least as a kicker in the NFL soon. I like the Saints too
1186,Yeah, they are too busy showing us ads to generate revenue.
1187,Thats a bit hypocritical of the team and the NFL given their stance against violence against women, don't you think?
1188,I would like to see the NFL season extended by giving another bye week, especially if games are being played overseas
1189,I find that hard to believe given the enormity of some of the NFL contracts these days
1190,Yeah, maybe they will get another one for the projected field goal line they have nowadays for next years awards
1191,I thought the colts were going to score that many during the Houston game yesterday...lol
1192,Time to watch the football games!
1193,I do like football. Do you have a favorite quarterback?
1194,I didn't. That's an interesting tactic. I think it's pretty interesting that Ben Roethlisberger is the winningest quarterback in the Cleveland Browns stadium.
1195,I've actually heard about such restrictions. Seems a little antiquated to me. Did you know that Russell Wilson is still under a MLB contract even though he hasn't played in a regular season game since 2011. He got traded to the Yankees this year.
1196,Seems an odd thing to do. His contract must not be worth very much and maybe they hope he'll retire from football and start playing baseball again. Wilson is also only one of 2 african-american quarterbacks to have won a super bowl.
1197,That is amazing. I guess it makes sense. They apparently have chips in the players shoulder pads and the footballs to record movements and other statistics.
1198,I actually had no idea. Brad Johnson is the only quarterback in NFL history to throw a touchdown pass to himself. I'd like to see some video of that!
1199,Clever. Kellan Moore is the only left handed quarterback in the NFL. I guess football doesn't attract left handers like baseball does.
1200,If I had to guess we'd probably see a female kicker first. Speaking of firsts, the first NFL game was played in 1932 inside Chicago Stadium.
1201,Well, I bet they wish that they had played him now. Matt Patricia is the only rocket scientist coaching in the NFL.
1202,Poor Cumberland. College football teams have some of the largest stadiums in the world. In fact 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums are college football teams.
1203,You would, but they're note. High school football stadiums are also somewhat out of control. There is a high school football stadium in Texas that seats 18,000.
1204,It is and if there is anywhere that they love football it is certainly Texas. High school football is a really big deal in certain areas. Snoop Dogg wrote a fight song for his son's high school football team.
1205,Hello there, I do like football, I usually follow pretty closely during the season.  How about you?
1206,I have, I was hoping that he would have gone to the super bowl this season.  How about you?
1207,Yeah you sure are glad then, your team has been dominating the last decade or so I would say.  Speaking of QB's, do you know who the only left handed one in the league is?
1208,Good call! Yeah it's him, I am surprised there aren't more.  Did you know Baker Mayfield is an excellent video game player?
1209,Yeah that was it, Halo 3, have you ever played any of the Halo games, I used to play the first Halo back when I was at school.
1210,I don't think I have ever played that one, 1 and 2 I did.  Speaking of QB's again, do you know which one invented the modern huddle?
1211,Good call again!  Yeah and he was a deaf quarterback as well, so that is even cooler!
1212,Do you know what the highest score of any football game ever was?
1213,Yeah it was, way back in 1916, poor Cumberland lost to Georgia Tech, sounds like it was never even a game.
1214,Yeah sure does, wonder how many Cumberland fans were left when the final whistle blew.
1215,And only the die hard Cumberland ones too lol.
1216,Yeah and that's an understatement.  Anyways, its been fun talking, I hope you enjoy the rest of your night.
1217,I am! My favorite team is the Dallas Cowboys. What about you?
1218,I actually did! I couldn't be one and agree to leave a restaurant simply because an NFL player decided to eat there too. I think that's ridiculous!
1219,I'm guessing, but probably to prevent dating the NFL players and socializing with them.
1220,That's crazy since a game typically takes 2 hours or so to actually complete. Football actually can refer to a number of different sports depending on what country/region you use the word "football".
1221,Actually, it can refer to rugby, Australian rules football, and Gaelic football as well as soccer. So many variations!
1222,My favorite QB used to be Troy Aikman until I met him and learned how much of an arrogant, rude, inconsiderate person he is. My husband loves Tom Brady. You?
1223,Yeah, but I still love Emmitt Smith. He was humble and nice. Tom Brady is good! He has 6 Super Bowl rings to prove it!
1224,HAHA! Well he is probably regretting that decision!
1225,Not very much. My husband does though, so we watch UGA play a lot and he likes to watch Sony Michel with the Patriots.
1226,Oh yes!!! I heard the visitor's locker room in painted pink!!! HAHA I think that's awesome!
1227,Some just never seem to get close.  LOL
1228,Yeah, there is Gaelic football which some women play too.
1229,I am surprised it isnt the Patriots.  They have won 6 alone with Tom Brady as the QB.
1230,Did you hear about that one game in 1916, 222-0.  Crazy score.  Georgia Tech was definitely working hard there.
1231,I dont even understand how a score can get that high, there are usually only 11 minutes of active game play per game.
1232,I think they also use the data to prevent player injury and to improve the pads themselves.  Which is cool
1233,I bet it changes things for Kellan Moore, hes the only southpaw in the NFL
1234,Which is what the US likes to call Soccer.  It is also a great game.
1235,There was once a deaf quarterback that actually created the modern day circular huddle.
1236,Yeah, he didnt want the opposing team stealing his hand signals.
1237,Alex Smith did as well, he stuck around after earning his degree and started work on a masters.
1238,I think that is horrible.  that is no way to treat people.
1239,What does eating at a restaurant have to do with the game?
1240,That seems like a long time.  Its been nice chatting, but I've got to get going.  Have a nice day
1241,Yes, I like it especially out at the live games where you can really get the feel from it.  I heard about Nathan Peterman who completed 5 out of 18 passes for  24 yards and two interceptions - a 0.0 passer rating - while getting sacked three times before getting benched.  Gee.
1242,Well, a lot of other women know a lot more than me about it.  But, I do know that the sport commonly called football in certain places includes association football which is known as soccer in most countries.  In America, we love what is called Gridiron football.
1243,That's the truth.  There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played by indigenous peoples in many different parts of the world. We love our games!
1244,I remember hearing that. Something else I recently learned about football is that the league consists of 32 teams which are divided equally between the NFC and the AFC.  I didn't catch on to that before.
1245,Yes, he must have very sticky hands. lol. Another interesting football fact is that an average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.
1246,I was surprised, it just seems to take so long for the game to be over.  New technology might help though.  NFL now uses tracking chips embedded in the players' shoulder pads to record a players every move on the field.
1247,Yes, I've heard that too.  Did you know that Kellan Moore is the only left handed quarterback in the NFL at this time?
1248,Another interesting fact is that the circular huddle used in today's American football was created by Paul D. Hubbard, a deaf quarterback, so that the other team could not read his hand signals. Amazing.
1249,It's actually very creamy and sweet if you make it correctly.  Go Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. I like him.  Did you hear that the highest score ever in a football game occured in 1916 when Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland 222 to 0?
1250,I know, right?  Did you also hear that Alex Smith took so many AP tests in high school that he entered the university as a junior?  He received his bachelor's degree in two years. That was quick!
1251,Thank you, I thought so too. Have a great night.
1252,Yes i do!  Curt cousins is greed and selfish
1253,Well, there are not many QBs to choose from, so maybe that's why
1254,Yeah that's for sure!  That's crazy that keelan moore is the only left handed QB in the NFL
1255,yup!  How about tom brady never getting to play on his HS losing season?
1256,definitely is!  I like Blake bortles, he actually lived in the town i live in
1257,OH that's cool! I would love to see a female kicker in the NFL
1258,i am sure too!  Can you believe only 11 minutes of actual playing time?
1259,oh yeah?  my high school had a girl on the team and a boy on the cheerleader team!  LOL
1260,well, they need to do a better job at spreading out their salaries over time instead of living in access
1261,REally?  WOW... talk about poor money management!  Funny how a saints cheerleader has to leave a restaurant if a saints player comes in
1262,Crazy!  Well i am out... been fun!  Take care!  Go Eeagles!!!! LOL
1263,Love Football but don't get to watch it at all, hoping to see some of the SB this Sunday
1264,I did i also heard there no written rule that keeps women from playing.
1265,That's crazy for how much revenue it generates. Now i hear there going to be using tracking chips in the players.
1266,I understand the football but what's the deal with the need to put them in shoulder pads.
1267,Well ok! Something about tracking chips makes a little nervy. Did you know that the circular huddle was created for a deaf quaterback?
1268,I assume that's to deter them from fraternizing. Can't do that if your forced to leave the restaurant.
1269,Probably was and they nipped it in the bud before the public got a hold to it. Seems being an Engineer is pretty lucrative, even more so than an nfl or mlb player over there lifetime.
1270,Yeah true that, still an honest profession. i wonder how much more they have to work to be consider having made more money?
1271,Apparently Kellan Moore is the only left handed quarterback in the NFL, that's strange.
1272,Yeah your right. I just remember as a kid hating that the ball spun the wrong way, haha! Iowa's coach had the visitors locker room painted Pink.
1273,Hi! Yes, pretty great Thank you! just finished watching some football videos. Are you a fan of Football?
1274,Haha! I agree it is a very aggressive sport. Which got me wondering why I hadn't seen any female football players did you know there are currently no written rules against female players in the NFL.
1275,Um, no I don't think so, but did you know an average nfl game is only 11 minutes of gameplay?
1276,Yes, It makes me ponder how much times have changed. Back in the 60's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars.
1277,Im not sure, but yes there seems to be a lot of irregularities within the sport for instance New Orleans Saints cheerleaders are not allowed to be in the same restaurants as any of the players.
1278,To each their own I suppose, speaking of lines, That super imposed yellow line you see in the game, ESPN has won an emmy for that. Did know that was possible.
1279,I think people should just have some common sense but I don't see that happening anytime soon. The NFL uses tracking devices to track players on the field, im sure that a way to keep tabs on players
1280,in that case the whole world would be tracked, I think we can think of better ways than to "control"
1281,Thats a whole other subject we dont have enough time here for. but this would be a whole different place if more Love was implemented the current system has people going crazy and violence is out of hand, we must look within oneself.
1282,I disagree, we have everything we need to look within ourself... you would just be giving YOUR power away by allowing to get chipped. Someone else in control of you and your decision. This plante would no longer be free will. The NFL should just stick with tracking balls to track speed and rotation
1283,Meditate, I feel the same way! but have found answers looking within, you need nothing else, change your vibration and your outlook in life and life will reciprocate. Itll be challenging but its worth it. Then and only then you will be free. Nice chatting with you too! Namaste. In Love and Light.
1284,Hi, how are you?
1285,Very well, thanks. Do you enjoy football?
1286,I did! Although I did fall asleep during the 4th quarter and woke up when trophy was being handed out... Did you watch?
1287,It wasn't... The glass of whiskey might have helped my sleep... Did you watch it?
1288,I thought they were just ok too. Who were you rooting for?
1289,Uh oh... I am from Chicago so we have an NFC North friction. Just kidding, we are united by our hatred of Green Bay!
1290,I liked the NFL 100. It's' the only one that really stood out to me. Plus my kids were watching next to me and talked the entire time...
1291,Yeah. What do you have in mind...
1292,My head understands it but my heart wants to see bone crushing hits. At the same time seeing the older NFL players struggle in daily life is tough...
1293,The QBs are protected pretty well so I would like to see some rules to help the def...
1294,Not really but there are times when the DEF is flagged for a simple hit that should not be flagged. Any way, thank you so much for the chat. I really enjoyed this one. I hope we get paired in the future...
1295,me too, I like college football, but I don't like the idea of it. especially how they treat their players
1296,I didn't hear, what did they do?
1297,what! no way. do you think it was to psych out their opponents?
1298,I did, it was an embarrassment, 222-0. wow. no mercy rule in football I guess, huh
1299,idk haha meanwhile we have the supervowl score not even reaching a combined 30 points! the team with zero must have just rolled over at one point
1300,it is absolutely necessary to use. I used to think that line was on the field in real life too and they just moved it a lot. then I went to a game and didn't see it
1301,the name rings a bell but I'm not sure what he did
1302,wow, what a guy. he must have been a star. Did you hear about Baker Mayfield?
1303,apparently early on in his career he considered quitting football to pursue a professional Halo 3 career. you don't hear that every day!
1304,that's a big maybe, I don't think the Halo 3 scene is as popular anymore. I think he made the right choice for sure
1305,i never knew that is how it happened but that it's really neat that it is because of a deaf quarterback so the other players could not see his hand signals
1306,I love football but there are a lot of things i did not know like there is only one left handed quarterback in the nfl his name is Kellan Moore
1307,Not sure but thats cool.I also just learned that the former patriots running back has never fumbled a football in his nfl career
1308,LOL i didnt think about that
1309,true true! Did you know there were tracking devices in uniforms and in the actual football itself
1310,that's crazy i never would have guessed that and that the new orleans saints cheerleaders are not allowed to dine with the nfl players and if they are eating already the cheerleaders have to stop eating and leave. i wonder why
1311,I agree, you're exactly right, you'd think they would have thought of that instead of drama happening if they do show up at the same spot
1312,yeah it would  be the smart thing to do and there are apps for taking your dog out for a walk so you think they would have one for that
1313,absolutely i wonder why they do that like if the team had some type of problems with the cheerleaders stalking or something
1314,you think that would be for all the teams not just one team out of how many
1315,they should be trusted to act prestigiously regardless of there job but people are human and we all mess up some more then others unfortunately
1316,yes you're right about that
1317,I do. I didn't realize that Kellan Moore is the only left handed quarterback in the NFL.
1318,Because he calls the plays and usually touches the ball on every offensive play. There is a quarterback named Russell Wilson who actually has a major league baseball contract in addition to his NFL contract. I didn't know that was possible.
1319,That is interesting, but makes sense, so other teams couldn't see his plays. The highest paid US Department of Defense employees are the football coaches of the service branch teams!
1320,Awesome! Brad Johnson once threw a touchdown pass to himself! That would have been interesting to watch!
1321,Wow. Not much at all. I wonder who will be in the Superbowl the first Sunday in February?
1322,I don't watch consistently, just once in a while. I didn't know the first playoff game was in 1932.
1323,That's ridiculous and so old fashioned! I didn't know the NFL uses tracking devices in players shoulder pads and in the footballs themselves to record everything that happens during a game.
1324,I don't follow them. I wonder if they will be one of the six teams from their conference to get into the playoffs.
1325,I didn't know there were two wild card teams from each division that get in, I though it was just one from each.
1326,Quite a claim to fame. College football is huge. 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums belong to american college football teams!
1327,Same to you!
1328,Yes.  Did you know they track players with tracking chips that are in their shoulder pads?
1329,It's amazing that there aren't any women playing in the NFL even though they are allowed to join.
1330,Maybe it's not all that cut out to be.  Engineers on average earn more than NFL players.
1331,Yeah.  Career paths can change unexpectedly for people.  Baker Mayfield considered being a competitive gamer.
1332,No I have not.  Also, Alex Smith had his bachelors degree before he was picked in the NFL draft.  We are not confined to one trade or craft.
1333,Yeah, everything is possible.  I hope though that New orleans saints cheerleaders get better treatment.
1334,It is amazing that NFL games usually have 11 minutes of actual live game play.  That fact somehow alluded me.
1335,Decades ago, it may have been a better option to be a bowler than a football player.
1336,Times were probably so different back then!
1337,I hope the changes to come will be changes that promote more diversity and equal treatment.  Use of tracking chips are a good step towards increasing safety.
1338,Not at this point. I think I'll stick to engineering. Better career longevity. But good for Tom! He's in the SB again. Getting a bit repetitive.
1339,I would guess that some powerhouse school played a puny academic institution. I wonder what the spread on the game was, and if the bookies took any bets.
1340,I wonder whether Georgia Tech put in their second and third string. The person scheduling that game must have been sacked. I'm surprised a Cumberland player didn't get killed!
1341,The game really is slow. It's punctuated with a lot of violent action, but it doesn't have the flow of basketball.
1342,I figure the concussions alone preclude a career as an engineer after the NFL. I am surprised that there is only one left-handed QB in the NFL. I guess I expected more, since each team has three QBs or so.
1343,I think female players could certainly handle non-contact positions such as kicker or punter. I don't know whether they could take the serious contact of the line of scrimmage.
1344,Kellan Moore is the only leftie out there. Brad Johnson has an interesting claim to fame: he is a QB, but he threw a TD to himself. I didn't know that was legal, but I guess the passer and receiver can be the same player.
1345,Either something really sinister or something feminine.
1346,I guess they could have painted it black, just like the Rolling Stones said. Might have put the opposition in a dire mood. Football is such a generic term. Could mean almost anything.
1347,Violence is the key. I think the presence of the ball is incidental. Just there as an excuse to pummel the other team. Texas seems to be obsessed with high school football.
1348,Good evening, yes I do.  How about you?
1349,Yes, don't hate me, but my favorite team is the Patriots!
1350,Cool, I didn't realize how many people actually LOATHE the New England Patriots and the GOAT Tom Brady.
1351,Yeah, I had heard that stat and I couldn't begin to imagine the pressure he felt to remain perfect throughout his career.  WoW!
1352,Me either, good for them, though.  It's such a part of watching the game, it deserved that award!
1353,Big difference between then and now, for sure.  Did you watch the last Superbowl?
1354,Glad to hear that.  lol I swear that game seemed it lasted three hours!
1355,Oh man, I knew there was alot of wasted time, but didn't think it was all that much, though.  Kind of makes me mad, now. lol
1356,So true!  Wonder why a woman hasn't played in the NFL, yet?
1357,Yeah, that must be an advantage of some kind?
1358,No, not a thing.  I think it is neat the way football means american football, soccer or rugby, depending on where you are.
1359,A running back that has never dropped the ball?  So, this implies american NFL football.  It is a dull game to watch, with only 11 minutes of live game play per game.
1360,I think like the gorgeous ladies of wrestling, it has been done.  But I would watch some of that.  Not sure a 17 week season would be fun.
1361,I believe the word average is very important there.  Some players never make it big, while most engineers pull money.  I wonder why cheerleaders can not be in the same restaurant as a new Orleans saint?
1362,An out dated and wrong thing.  I be some engineers use chips in players pads to track and record players movement.  Those engineers get paid more than the player.
1363,On the field and the one in the ball.  To bad the balls from Tom Brandies deflate gate were not monitored for air pressure.  The ball measures velocity, rotation and location.
1364,I have no favorite.  I would think left handed would be an advantage.  Most players would expect the ball to be in a certain location. Kellan would be a little off that.  The offensive team leader that touches the ball the most.
1365,Such a important innovation.  Now everyone does it.  Or maybe stadium is so loud no one can hear.   There was a QB who wanted to be a pro gambler.  Oklahoma player I think.
1366,There are many things bout the game that seem like video games.  Take the line for the first down.  we expect it.  ESPN won an Emmy for its creation.
1367,Good for Alex.  I wonder if he picked a useful major like engineering.  In the 1960's pro bowlers made as much as top football stars.  I wonder if engineers make more than bowlers?
1368,I watch one in a while. I find the games boring sometimes. They only play an average of 11 minutes per game!
1369,I know there's no rule saying they can't, so I guess if they can meet the requirements, they should probably be allowed.
1370,Yeah, they might as well get a fair shot. Some of the rules of the NFL are still sexist. Like how some cheerleaders can't eat at a restaurant where players are eating
1371,Yeah, that's pretty cool. Some things like that are so high tech. Like the yellow first down line that ESPN won an Emmy for!
1372,I agree! They are in the footballs and shoulder pads! Do you know what the score of the highest scoring football game ever was?
1373,That's amazing! The highest score was 222-0! But it was a college game.
1374,It was way back in 1916. That's pretty funny, actually. I wonder what the visiting teams thought of that.
1375,I am kind of sick of them being in the Super Bowl every year, it's boring! He must feel a lot of pressure never to get his first fumble!
1376,That's pretty cool. He was the first pick in the 2005 draft, too!
1377,That's brilliant, actually! There is only one left handed quarterback in the NFL.
1378,I do!  I'm a big fan!
1379,Yes it is!  The University of Iowa painted their visitors locker room pink.  Wonder why they did that?
1380,That would make sense.  In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars of that era. I'm sure that's not like that any longer.
1381,lol  The highest scoring football game ever was when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland 222-0 in 1916.  Talk about a blowout!
1382,No doubt!  ESPN won an emmy for creating the yellow superimposed first down line you see on tv while watching games.  I didn't even know they gave out emmy's for something like that.
1383,Yes! lol Former Patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled the ball in his NFL career.  Impressive!
1384,I'm not sure. lol  That is amazing that there is only 1 left handed QB.
1385,What was his name?  I can't remember it.
1386,Nice!  The NFL has no written rule against female players.  Wonder if we will see one ever?
1387,True.  The average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.  Relatively short compared to how long they stretch the games out.  It's been fun chatting!
1388,Indifferent.  A lot of people think it is fine.
1389,Why do you think so?  Some people think that a tie should not be seen as less satisfying.
1390,I am not an expert.  However, I admire some NFL teams.
1391,I prefer college footballs better - no money is involved in it.  Do you know that NFL has no rule against female players?
1392,Probably.  Do you know that average NFL game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay?  What do you think about it?
1393,I heard about it.  Why do they do that? Why pink?
1394,I read about it.  He did not want the other team to read his hand signals.
1395,Are you serious? But Georgia Tech won though.  Shouldn't you be proud?
1396,You are funny.  Cumberland humiliated themselves.
1397,I read about it?  Now bowlers make pennies compared to football players.
1398,I'm good.  It was nice chatting with you.  Talk to you again next time.
1399,Yea, the Giants are my favorite team but I keep up with all 32 teams
1400,He's an awesome player but becomes a liability due to his temperament, the Giants aren't gonna be doing too well even if they kept him I just wish they got better picks for him
1401,Maybe Iowa thinks the pink locker room will cause the visiting team to play worse
1402,Yea I never even thought bowlers made much money, let alone more than football stars
1403,Yea, sports are constantly evolving, like the invention of the circular huddle by Paul D Hubbard
1404,Yea, I wonder if the only left handed QB Kellan Moore invented any special techniques
1405,Yea, I wonder if Alex Smith has different mechanics considering he's really smart, he started college as a junior
1406,Yea he's a smart dude but I'm not so sure about Baker Mayfield, he considered playing games professionally instead of playing football
1407,That's pretty cool, I wonder if playing for Bill Belichick had any thing to do with Green-Ellis never fumbling
1408,I know Georgia Tech scored 222 point back in 1916, I wonder if they cheated at all
1409,Good, how about yourself ?
1410,Yes, I do..
1411,I heard Junior Galette from Washinton might be a free agent next year.
1412,He going to see if a new team wants to sign him next year. He probably won't garner much interest, because he's very injury prone..
1413,Plus his sack numbers were down. He use to be good when he played for the New Orleans Saints, but I think his best days are behind him.
1414,His current team really cut his playing time, which according to him, limits his opportunity to sack the quarterback.
1415,Junior Galette  has had a slew off trouble off the field. He was even accused of domestic violence.
1416,Plus, there are a lot better young players on the Redskins, namely Ryan Anderson.
1417,Hopefully if he stays with the Redskins he can return to his former glory. He did rank third on the team in quarterback pressures.
1418,There is a loyal fan base in Washington, I'm sure everyone wants to see him do better next season.
1419,I'll be rooting for him.
1420,I'm not a huge fan because I'm a Bengals fan lol. Same division. I'm surprised they got rid of Flacco.
1421,My favorite is probably Patrick Mahomes.
1422,Did you know Kellan Moore is the only left handed QB in the NFL?
1423,Alex Smith is an awesome guy. Did you know Russell Wilson is still under an MLB contract?
1424,Not too sure how that works. I don't think they would actually use him.
1425,I saw they don't have a written rule against it. I bet we will see a female kicker before long.
1426,That is crazy it is only 11 minutes of gameplay.
1427,That is very crazy. I would have never guessed that.
1428,That's interesting. I heard many teams have rules around players and cheerleaders.
1429,LOL I wonder if that works?
1430,Yes.  I did know that. It is Iowa.  I think that is great competition.
1431,True.  It is value based on audience.  The NFL has the eyeballs now.  I do love that yellow line that ESPN added to football broadcasts.
1432,He would call the audible by talking.  Only he would not hear it.  ESPN got an Emmy for that yellow line.
1433,I agree.  I greatly prefer college ball with many more plays.  The global family of games called football all have some way to score involving kicking.  It is pretty minor in US football I think.
1434,Wouldn't you be embarrassed to be the coach of a JV team.  never win, never score, have Tom Brady as you back-up QB and never let him play?
1435,It is just a short career.  The average running back lasts 4 years.  The QBs today make a lot though.  Imagine if Baker Mayfield had quit football to be a gamer.  He would not have been cashing the big checks that he does today.
1436,Never played Halo, but I went to Oklahoma University so I watched every college game he played.  Alex Smith took so many AP tests that he entered college as a junior.  My grandson is taking a lot which will save his parents money.
1437,Do you play NFL fantasy football.  You play 17 weeks from Sept to Dec even though each team only plays 16 games.
1438,It is hard to be an optimist when one follows politics closely.  We are so polarized.  I would not mind giving political fantasy a try.
1439,No.  But my grown son plays in 5 leagues and makes between $500 and $800 each year.
1440,Morning! I do! I try to watch it every week during the regular season. How about you?
1441,nah not really, thats a little bit too much for me to follow and the teams are always changing around
1442,holy cow! I wonder how that happened haha thats such a huge amount of points scored
1443,I know Id like to watch that game and see what happened. Did you know Snoop Dogg wrote the fight song for his high school team? haha it must have been a good song
1444,and apparently the highest paid people in the US defense dept are all football coaches from the service branch teams. That seems unnecessary to me
1445,I wonder how much bowlers were paid? or how little a football player was paid. it is definitely the opposite today
1446,well the yellow line ESPN made IS revolutionary and changed the televised game forever for the better
1447,eh I dunno! they give out some strange awards apparently haha
1448,yea I heard it was painted pink, must be some kind of psychological warfare!
1449,I know right? Did you know Kellen Moore is the only left handed QB in the NFL?
1450,Both. i go to games occasionally. not as often as snoop dog, but i go
1451,whoa. i want a refund. but these days even a high school stadium cost 60 million bucks..so im not holding my breath
1452,Plus, there isn't risk of injury like there is in football. Perhaps the engineers can tweak those chips embedded in the players uniforms to measure brain injuries
1453,yeah...dont want the wife to know where ur going.
1454,i wonder if they got chips in them too. then they can be warned before entering the restaurant
1455,well I like the way Sam Donald recovered from his first pass...but Russell Wilson's so versatile he could play baseball
1456,wow. almost as impressive as throwing a td pass to yourself
1457,Brad Johnson did it. Won a Super Bowl.
1458,wow. alex smith should give it a try. he's smart enough to learn anything fast
1459,interesting. smarter than a circular firing squad no doubt.  its not rocket science but there has only been one rocket scientist coaching in the nfl
1460,Me too! so what do you think about the Eagles this season? are you a football fan?
1461,What time are you a fan of? its kind of hard to pick with all the teams In the NFL
1462,Oh, I see, I like Barcelona, Im a Messi fan actually I  think he is a great player.
1463,He is also a great player! do you think Lewandowski will go to Real Madrid at some point? It would be a great team for him.
1464,Yeah he does, what other players from Poland do you like or see having a big future?
1465,I see, didnt really followed Poland on the last World Cup, so howcome you dont life American Football?
1466,Well my favorite team didnt even make it lol, and yeah I do like it, did you know a team lost by 220 once.
1467,yeah that is a lot! it would be like losing 20-0 in a soccer game, and regularily teams score up to 60 points and games are tight.
1468,Yeah, that or the other team was blind, apparently both teams were at college level.
1469,Definetely, I would retire from football after a loss like that one lol, kind of like the Brazilean soccer team in the 2014 World Cup, just a total humiliation.
1470,I know and in their own turf.
1471,Well, they should. Everybody is equal.
1472,Well, think about it, in high school, they opened football to both genders.
1473,The only sport I watch and enjoy the most is basketball. I feel football and baseball are boring. After the 7th inning, I'm yawning.
1474,Yes, I have heard about that. I wonder why. Sexual harassment?
1475,Maybe, they need to put an end to it.
1476,I bet it is the opposite of today, as well. I feel that football players do way more than bowlers.
1477,Well, I am not a bowler. I had a turkey in one sitting, but that was it. It depends whether you have spares or not, as well.
1478,Imagine how much money he is making.
1479,Well, I heard as a rumor, but others say that it is a fact. However, people who are left handed can get into small or large accidents.
1480,Really? Well, my cousins aren't gay so those are assumptions that you have.
1481,Hey there I watch football sometimes. I never knew there were thirty two different teams though, do you watch it?
1482,Apparently the teams are split between two divisions, the NFC and the AFC, but I don't know which teams go in which division, do you?
1483,Yeah and they also have no rule against female players, so I'm just wondering when you think a female player is going to start playing for the NFL? They could probably have a kicker or something right now
1484,I did hear about that. I can't even eat in the same restaurant as a player, and then if the player comes in even if they are already eating, the cheerleader would have to leave. I think that's very messed up
1485,Yeah it seems very outdated. What is not updated though is the use of tracking chips in football players. Apparently they put chips in the players shoulder pads and they can tell how fast the players are running as well as their location
1486,Yeah I hope they can fix the brain damage that players are getting. Also it's shocking that the average football game only has about 11 minutes of gameplay, that seems so low especially when games seem to last hours when you watch them on TV
1487,I agree with you! Also I have an engineering degree and apparently an engineer will make more over their lifetime than the average NFL player. I guess that I have that going for me LOL
1488,LOL well at least you can make good music! and it's crazy that in a 60s Bowlers would make almost twice as much as football stars, so you never know that music education Majors could end up making more sometime in the future haha
1489,Haha that's true. Do you know what the highest scoring football game of all time was? Apparently it was between Georgia Tech and Cumberland and the score was 222-0 lol
1490,Yeah I would have given up when it was 100 to 0 LOL, do you like the Patriots player BenJarvus Green-Ellis?
1491,Yeah I agree. I like the Patriots a lot. Do you have a favorite quarterback? Personally I like Tom Brady
1492,I liked that he was in Ace Ventura haha. But there are other interesting quarterbacks like Kellen Moore. Apparently he was the only left-handed quarterback in the NFL, great talking to you by the way!
1493,I actually do. Did you know Snoop dog wrote a song for the high school team of his son?
1494,Yeah that must not have been very pleasant. Do you know who are the three most paid defense employees?
1495,Yeah they are, not sure what to make of that really. Do you know where is one of the largest high school stadiums?
1496,The stadium is in Allen, Texas with 18000 seats and cost $60 million to build. Oh who played in that game?
1497,Wow that is a huge difference. Did you know the majority of largest football stadiums are in the US?
1498,Wow that is so short. Did you know nowadays they put tracking ships on the players?
1499,Well the tracking chips are in there to track velocity and speed and rotation so that they can use those to make the game better. I find that rule so sexist
1500,I guess that makes sense because football players might make a lot but their career is short
1501,I like Alex Smith, heard he was super smart too as he finished college in 2 years
1502,Yeah heard he also has said that he can beat anyone in that game at the U of Kansas
1503,Good.  Is Tom Brady still with the Patriots?
1504,When is the next NFL championship game?
1505,Do you have any guess which team is going to win?
1506,the Patriots?
1507,I'm not that familiar with NFL teams. I know it consists of 32 teams.
1508,Are you going to watch the next Super Bowl?  It's usually held first Sunday of February.
1509,Do you usually watch the games at home?  My friend celebrate the super bowl like it is christmas.
1510,Do you know that the american flags you see at stadiums weigh 1100 pounds?
1511,They cost approximately $50,000 to make them.
1512,NFL owners can afford it.
1513,I did not know that. Did they collaborate with the NFL?
1514,I have to run.  It was nice chatting with you.
1515,I've heard that, Paul D. Hubbard, he did it so the other team could not read his hand signals. That's pretty innovative.
1516,Oh wow, I didn't realize that. It seems that Tom Brady had a rough start in football, his JV team had a historically bad season in which they didn't win a game nor score a touchdown, yet they never gave him a chance to play because he was the backup quarterback.
1517,It's a good thing he stuck with football. He did pretty great for his rookie season with the Browns.
1518,Oh wow, that's cool. He's done better than me. I went to school for 6 years for an Associates. Haha.
1519,I didn't know that, I'm surprised there hasn't been a woman to play. I think it would be great.
1520,That's pretty wild. They take like 3 hours. I guess that's how they make their money.
1521,That's neat. Do they use it to track velocity, rotation, ball speed and location?
1522,That's crazy to think, but I guess an engineer's career is a lot longer than an NFL player.
1523,Oh wow. Did you know that the high score ever in a football game was 222-0?
1524,That's a prestigious award. I've heard that University of Iowa's visiting locker room is completely painted pink. That has to fire up the opposing team.
1525,no it seems to go on forever
1526,yes and the season only goes on for 17 weeks but then they drag it on with all those ther competitions
1527,woo hoo, do you like football?
1528,back in the 1960s bowlers earned more than footballers how times change
1529,One player even considered competitive video games instead i wonder if they would make more?
1530,why is there only one left handed quarter back?
1531,I never knew that
1532,did you know already that Iowas painted the locker room pink?
1533,what is it indended to do?
1534,Maybe they should of tried with georgia tech in 1916
1535,I like to watch it, but I am not a fan.  Did you know that Espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed?
1536,I heard about it. Think that was in  1976, but I am not sure what happened.
1537,Now I remember.  in 1960 it  was when top bowlers made twice  as top football stars
1538,I know.  do you know something about the football codes?
1539,Ok. there are certain interesting thing about football like the fact that a university locker room is painted pink.  Don't know why.
1540,could be.
1541,That's pretty interesting. I guess they want to  track velocity and rotation and some other things.
1542,how can they forbidden from eating in the same restaurant?
1543,new orleans saints cheerleaders
1544,I don´t know why but it is too much. they are required to leave the restaurant if an nfl player comes in after
1545,Hey, are you into football?
1546,Yes. Did you hear Chase Routllier is starting center with the Redskins?
1547,Nice. I enjoy watching Chase Roullier. He takes very good angles, and good technique. He's a rookie, but he seems to be excelling in his position on the team.
1548,Yeah, he has to get comfortable with the offense with him being a center. Did you also hear Chris Thompson, runner back, is almost back to full health?
1549,I definitely agree with that statement. I know a lot of teams do not treat the cheerleaders of the football teams equally. The New Orleans Saint's Cheerleaders are not even allowed to eat in the same restaurant as their football players. So I bet the female players wouldn't get treated fairly.
1550,I believe that the NFL shouldn't allow technology like that, because it could make coach's nit pick player's every moves. They need to let the players play naturally. Thank you for talking with me today about football.
1551,Did you hear about the new helmet rule in the NFL?
1552,Players cannot lower their heads and make contact with opponents. I seen it on an Eagles game I was watching.
1553,I think the rule is hard for players when they are used to tackling in that manner. Wow that score is so high!
1554,Did you know ESPN won an Emmy for the creation of the yellow line representing the first down line for American football games?
1555,Yes, thank you!
1556,He was a terrific football player who helped my team the Eagles to the NFL championship in '60.
1557,Close on this year too!  I wish McDonald would have been around to help, but he unfortunately died at the age of 84.  He was a Hall of Famer.
1558,He started out as a two-time All American in Oklahoma and played 12 seasons for the NFL making the Pro Bowl 6 times.  He was quite a player for his small figure at 5 foot 7 inches.
1559,Not particularly, but I like the Super Bowls.  If women started playing, that would be fun to watch.  The NFL has no rule against it.  I would cheer them on.
1560,I do like bowling though.  Are you a bowler?  In the 60's they made two times more than football players.
1561,Perhaps if Rb Benjarvus Green-Ellis were around then, the football players may have made more money with his impressive no fumbles in his NFL career.
1562,I'm not sure but with only 11 minutes of live gameplay in the average game it still is impressive.
1563,The balls and players are constantly tracked though.  All this technology adds to the game an extra tactic not used back in Tommy McDonalds time.  I bet no tracking chips were used then.
1564,Do you listen to games on the radio?  If you do, you can also hear Jupiter's radio storms on the am stations.
1565,Sure is and it sounds like soldiers who also were probably far away from home made radios out of just a razorblade and pencil diode.  That was very inventive.
1566,Hello there, I do like football, did you watch the Super Bowl recently?
1567,Yeah thats about the average actual gameplay during a regular game.  There are lots of stops and reviews and all.
1568,Yeah I think that would be so cool if a female player made a pro roster in the near future.
1569,It would, and it would give young girls something to motivate them to achieve all sorts of goals.
1570,Yeah I read about that, it seems a bit silly and outdated if you ask me.
1571,Yeah I agree, did you know about the average lifetime earnings?
1572,That is what I figure it is, that the average career of a pro sports player is so much shorter.
1573,Yeah I read about that, I think it helps them develop better safety features as well.
1574,Yeah I do, I found a good local station that I really like.  How about yourself?
1575,Yeah isn't that so cool!  Very interesting.
1576,I watched parts of the last superbowl. I have a passing knowledge and passing interest in football so I am on and off
1577,Do you know why?
1578,Indeed, perhaps it is a mental thing to catch them off guard. So are you familiar with the nfl?
1579,I couldn't believe that the average nfl game is only 11 minutes
1580,I admit a lot and I mean a lot of action goes on in those few minutes. I mean the nfl is even putting chips in the ball and shoulder pads to get better data
1581,I admit their yellow line which they got an emmy for definitely made the game much more digestible for the audience
1582,I'm not sure but it must have been at least a difference of 150
1583,I wonder if georgia tech was just that good, cumberlands was that bad, or perhaps a bit of both
1584,That does sound most plausible. Georgia tech must have had talents like tom brady or green ellis
1585,True. Perhaps surprising until 50 pts, entertaining until 100 pts, and dull until 222 points
1586,I am good. Just missing football season. I can't wait for the 32 teams to get back out on the field in the fall!
1587,I am from florida so I root for the dolphins even though they are terrible! The dolphins lose most of their 16 games a season.How about you?
1588,Hard to believe NFL football has been played since 1932. The field was 80 yards back then.
1589,I would like to see some female players. I bet they would be very strategic.
1590,Have you ever seen snoop dogg's son play? he's pretty good! Snoop wrote a song for the high school team his son was on.
1591,I enjoy listening to games on the radio. The use of air waves and electromagnetic energy waves is a great way to consume football.
1592,Engineers are the creators of the tracking chips the NFL uses to measure player moves on the field.
1593,That would be amazing! A brilliant engineer that now coaches in the NFL is named Matt Patricia.
1594,Humiliating score for the losing team! They probably did not make it to the super bowl on the first Sunday in February.
1595,That is impressive! He deserves a nice stadium like the Allen, Texas one that cost 60 million.
1596,Great.  Are you in one of the 32 NFL cities?
1597,I am in Phoenix, one of the 16 NFC cities.  Unfortunately, we have the number one draft choice which means the worst record.
1598,I would hope Kyler Murray but the defensive guy from Ohio State is most likely.  The season is 17 weeks even though each team only plays 16 games.
1599,I have heard a little rumbling, but I thought it was about gender rather than homosexuality.  What have you heard?
1600,I think that some teams just worry about PR challenges.  It takes a team chemistry to win.  I expect to see a woman kicker someday.  No rule against women in the NFL.
1601,Great point.  Imagine the income that players get from only 11 minutes of action in each game.  If you play defense or offense, that is 5.5 minutes for you.
1602,True.  I started my career as an engineer and made about $4 million so far.  My neighbor was a running back for the Cardinals and he made $7 million in his last season.  But on average, engineers make more than NFL players over a career.
1603,There is a push for women in STEM.  He coaches running backs for another NFL team now, so he is doing okay.  Brand new Porche in his driveway this week.  In New Orleans, the cheerleaders cannot dine in the same restaurant as a player.  The cheerleader has to leave if a player comes in.
1604,Those NFL salaries took a while to grow.  In the 1960's, top bowlers earned more than NFL players.
1605,You are right.  Also, the NFL has to pay a lot more players than the 10 or 12 top bowlers.  That ESPN yellow line that marks the line to gain for a first down has been a nice improvement for TV watchers.
1606,Nice chat!
1607,Love it and sad it is over for the year. It seems like the season goes so fast. You know the season is only 17 weeks with one bye week. Not enough football for me.
1608,Did you know that Jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an am radio.  I wonder what that sounds like!
1609,I love some talk radio so that channel may be fun to listen to! In Canada the music on their radios have to be at least 40% must be canadian.
1610,I know...you think that football players get paid the big bucks but I heard in the long run you are better off being an engineer.  They tend to have higher than average lifetime earnings of both a NFL and MLB player!
1611,Better than being a cheerleader...the New Orleans Saints cheerleaders are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as any nfl player and they even have to leave if one comes in to eat. Talk about double standards!
1612,That is sure to annoy the visiting team! Did you know that in the 60s top bowlers made more money than football stars. Crazy!  Doesn't sound right!
1613,Thank goodness no one is tracking how slow I am! You know the game football means different sports to different people. Like soccer in some countries is called football in others. So confusing!
1614,Wow! I feel sorry for the team that lost. Wasn't it Cumberland?
1615,Patriots are an amazing team...love or hate them they have the talent. Did you watch the Super Bowl this year? It is usually held the first sunday of february.
1616,Me too!  Well maybe next year with the season starts in September you can make it to a game.
1617,I hope so!  It was nice talking to you. Have a good day!
1618,Yes I do. U of Iowa painted the visitor locker room pink
1619,I wonder too. Bowlers make more money than them though in the 60s
1620,True. Do you know what the highest score in college football is?
1621,Yeah and that was way back in 1916 and is still a record
1622,Yes that was for the superimposed yellow line
1623,Wow, what a guy. Do you listen to the radio?
1624,Nice. Do you ever listen to Canadian radios?
1625,Yes they are required to do that by law, 40% of it has to be canadian
1626,Yes they used pencils and razorblades to make those
1627,Yes there is a free website where you can listen to them too
1628,I do sometimes. How about you?
1629,I know isn't that crazy as long as a game lasts. Did you know in the 60's bowlers made twice as much as the top football players.
1630,I think guys would give them a hard time but it's cool. And if they are on the University of Iowa visiting team they get a pink locker room
1631,I think that is crazy. If they are at away game what are the chances of them running into a player at a restaurant. I wonder if they enforce it.
1632,That is true. And I think it is interesting that NFL uses tracking chips in their players shoulder pads
1633,True. Can you believe there was a game of a score of 222-0. How is that even possible.
1634,That is a great accomplishment. Did you know ESPN won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line.
1635,I like ESPN for some things. I got ESPN 2 for UFC events and it has not been a good experience.
1636,That is nice of him to do. NFL players make a lot of money but it's interesting that Engineers make more money than NFL players
1637,Do you like to listen to the radio?
1638,Hello!  Yes big fan here!  How about you?
1639,I would like to see a girl play.  Be nice.  The university of Iowa painted their visitors locker rooms pink.  Must have been to mess with the other team.
1640,I doubt it.  lol  In the 1960's someone would have been better off to be a top bowler rather than a top football star of the day because bowlers made twice as much money as the footballers did.
1641,I bet nowhere near as much as the players.  However, the average lifetime earnings of an engineer are more than the earnings of an average football player.
1642,That would be my guess.  Do you know what the highest score ever was for a college football game?
1643,Talk about a blowout!  I was surprised to find out that there is actually only 11 minutes of live gameplay per an average NFL game.  I thought it would have been a little more than that.
1644,Yes and tv timeouts. lol  How about RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis.  The former Patriots running back never fumbled the ball once in his NFL career.
1645,I know.  I wonder how many carries he had?  Did you know that ESPN won an emmy for the superimposed yellow first down line you see while watching games?
1646,I love listening to the radio!  How about you?
1647,Same here.  I actually listen to a lot of sports talk radio.  I didn't know that about Jupiter.  How cool is that?
1648,Hi, how are you? Are you a football fan? Do you follow the NFL? Which of the 32 teams do you like?
1649,I usually root for the underdog in the Superbowl. :) Did you know that there's only 11 minutes of live gameplay in an NFL game? That's a great salary on a per-minute basis.
1650,I guess that to prevent relationships between players and cheerleaders. They must have had problems in the past.
1651,True. Speaking of women, I wonder when women will play in the NFL. There's no rule against it.
1652,I used to listen to the radio when I was a kid. Now I use the Internet, which is much more convenient.
1653,I don't know that I would want to listen. Probalby not as good as Top 40.
1654,Not really a football player. Heard that back in the 60s, top bowlers made more than pro football players. Things certainly have changed.
1655,I don't know the rules for the other forms of football. Seems to be a universal sport. I wonder if any of those teams paints their visiting team's locker room pink.
1656,Are you going to watch the Super Bowl this weekend? Which of the teams is your favorite?
1657,ESPN won an award for that feature in the televised games! It makes it easier for viewers to understand the game.
1658,I wonder what generation listens to those programs. Youngsters don't want to hear those shows.
1659,Well, it's been fun chatting!
1660,Bye!
1661,I do. U of Iowa painted the visitor locker room pink
1662,I wonder too. Bowlers made more than them in the 60s too
1663,Yes it was 222-0 when Georgia Tech beat Cumberland
1664,Yeah and still holds. Did you know ESPN won and EMmy once?
1665,I am glad they did that, it has made game watching easier
1666,Yes the guy that never fumbled the ball. Do you watch tv?
1667,I sure do. There is an episode where Bart does not appear
1668,Yeah. How about That 70s SHow?
1669,Yes after just 10 episodes because it was remade verbatim
1670,Yes I have seen only some of the 750 episodes that are out there
1671,Same here
1672,Reid, 26 year old pick out of LSU, played some linebacker out of necessity in 2017
1673,He tweet " people who know football know who can play. people who know me, know my character".
1674,Football is a family of team sports that involve, but we become one nation to achieve for the nation.
1675,He is best player but the football missed him very much.
1676,Television sometimes shortened to tele is a great communication medium.
1677,Very much. Television is a mass medium for advertising.
1678,For watching football only i buy the TV. What your favourate team ?
1679,I move to Atlanta. You played tennis ?
1680,Some time i watch it.  Wimbledon is my favourite tournament.
1681,yes, Its one man show. Strong body and mental required for it.
1682,Well, I much less, I find out. And I see that program, I like it
1683,Yes, I had read something in particular about it, it's something surprising. They should have played alone in the field, that team weighed the other
1684,It's a very strange thing, there are many women capable for these types of sports, but good.
1685,There will come a time when the first will be encouraged and so will the others
1686,How curious is that? Well, I have some thought of some because of it, but. What do you think?
1687,Well, I suppose it's because of creating bonds in the middle of all this, it's not good for players to have their head in something else
1688,We are not sure of anything, they are pure speculations ... But we must not remove the possibility
1689,Or yes, yes ... Also today something about this, it is rumored that it is for the visiting team to know that they are better and this feels less
1690,To me that could cause me rather desire to cover their mouths and beat them to learn. But hey, all this is part of the show
1691,Well of course. What is worth there is the best performance, the better the teams, the better the matches
1692,Also, have a great day
1693,I didn't know that either! It's possible they only allow it because they think it very unlikely a woman will make a team.
1694,Yeah, I wonder if that is why they don't make more than the average engineer!  Their careers tend to be short with all of the injuries
1695,That is crazy to me, the technology that is in NFL games now.  Like how they were saying that the last time that Jim Nantz called a Dallas-Washington game, it was so much less technical.  No first down lines, no fancy replays.
1696,I can't decide if I like the technology or not.  It helps make things fair and makes it nice to watch.  But it probably slows things down.  It was pretty eye-opening that an average game only has 11 minutes of actual live gameplay
1697,Yep, though somehow, I still watch and enjoy the games.  I can actually remember the season that Jim last called that game, because the Cowboys beat my team that year when they won the Superbowl!  Crazy to think back that far
1698,Ha!  I can't even imagine that.  It shows how much football has changed in the last 60 years, how much players earn now versus then
1699,I guess I am a pretty casual fan, because I had never noticed the "cross-flexing" thing before.  It is interesting how much they play the ratings numbers now, to get the best games at the best times.  I didn't know that 80% of the country got that late afternoon game
1700,Anything to get inside their head, I guess!  I guess it is implying they're girly?  The thing that stuck out to me as being the oddest fact was that the Saints cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as an NFL player!  I wonder what the reason for that is
1701,The NFL really is kind of a crazy thing, because this country is just SO into it.  I can't even believe the TV contracts.  A billion dollars for the rights to just half of the games is nuts!  But they can make money on it because the country is full of such rabid fans
1702,In a close game, the slow pace kind of makes the splash plays that much more exciting.  Then again there are games like that last Cowboys-Redskins game they mentioned, where the Cowboys just racked up 38 unanswered points.  And when it's that easy for a team, it's kind of fun to watch your team do well like that.
1703,I do actually, Did you know that women can play too?
1704,Yes as long as they can meet the requirements they are good to play
1705,yeah and yet we are glued to the tv for hours
1706,Well they do have longer careers too though so that makes sense
1707,Yeah. Did you hear of that rule for Saints cheerleaders?
1708,Yes and worst, they also have to leave mid meal when they walk in
1709,I agree. U of Iowa painted the visitor locker room pink
1710,I wonder too. Bowlers made more money in the 60s that football players
1711,Yeah true. Do you know what the highest score in college football is?
1712,Yeah what a score that must have been even for 1916
1713,No, but this is just his first term in office.. Who knows what the future holds? He might make a blockbuster pop album (like the President of Indonesia) which might put him over the top!
1714,Who knows. He's friends with Kanye West these days. It could happen! I wonder if Kanye stayed at the President's guest house when he came to Washington recently. After all, the guest house is bigger than the White house!
1715,I would love to hear Trump say to Hillary, "You're Fired!"  I can't imagine the types of things the fake media would focus on then. With all the bizarre reporting, at least they don't call him President Banana, which is what they called the first President of Zimbabwe
1716,That is true in the NFL, but I am not sure if it is true in other forms of football, like rugby, canadian football, Gaelic football, etc. Does that mean we would see male Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders too?
1717,College football has male cheerleaders on the squads. I remember seeing them at a University of Iowa game. I also heard that their visitors locker room was pink.
1718,I think political correctness has gone too far lately.
1719,And most of that is hang time for punts!  Lots of surprising trivia about football. Did you know Patriots running back, Green-Ellis, has never fumbled the ball? I wonder if he still plays for the Pats and if so, if he will play this weekend.
1720,Well, I hope he stays healthy and can play a few more seasons. I'm sure he needs the cash An average lifetime earnings for an engineer is higher than the average lifetime earnings for an NFL player. And Brady has a model wife he has to feed!
1721,I hope the score of the superbowl game is high. Not as high as that historic  222-0 Georgia Tech romp  over Cumberland!
1722,But if you turned the TV off, you would miss those Emmy award winning virtual yellow lines ESPN puts on the field. That is worth the price of admission!
