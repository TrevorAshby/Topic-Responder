I'm not sure I could get ones where they ask about specific plays. person1:Right? I wouldn't either. I guess during that episode Alex Trebek was considered the entertainment on that show hahaa, There were some pretty funny answers. person2:He is pretty good. I mean, Aaron Rodgers considers him the greatest of all time of game show hosts. person1:He is! I like him a lot.

That must mean a lot of commercials and penalties go on during a game!  Football has been around a long time though. The first playoff was in 1932. person1:Wow, that is a long time!

That's amazing! He must love the game a lot! Even back in the 60's pro bowlers made more than top football players!

The superbowl is the best, I do watch that for sure! Those players are like animals on the field when it comes to the Superbowl! person2:I have to admit I do like watching the best of the nfc and afc compete against each other!

I guess since there are 20 quintillion animals out there this lawyer has his work cut out for him! person2:I bet he does at that!  I wonder if he would need a translator for some.  Some animals from distant areas speak different dialects or languages. person1:True, lol....I guess some animals are protected already like the loch ness monster.

So I was reading about Pokemon and I guess there are over 750 episodes. That's about 50 a year, for 16 years straight! person2:are you a pokemon fan? i have never seen the show. i figure its for kids. is it? person1:I'm not so much  fan, I was actually reading about televisions, since I just recently broke mine. But my youngest brother used to love that show, so I would do the Pikachu voice for him. (The little yellow character, that I think is most popular). person2:isnt that show japanese or something? person1:Speaking of foreign TV, I heard that 70's show was remade verbatim in the UK, and called \"Days Like These\" and was cancelled after 10 episodes. I wonder why? Did they not have the same kind of 70's as we had here?  person2:why would they do something so stupid as that? verbatim? like that would fool anyone. person1:I'm not sure what they where trying to do there. So I just found out that New York's area code is 212 because it was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone. I didn't even know New York's area code and now I learned a fun fact! :) person2:have you ever used a rotary phone? very slow. the new yorkers got lucky. person1:Yes I have used a rotary phone! Makes me feel so old, haha. But good times, for sure. Oh wow, this is more of a weird fact, than a fun fact but apparently it's impossible to separate 2 phone books that simply have their pages overlapped together! What not that I have a phone book but I'd like to test that to make sure! person2:it is a useless fact except maybe for a bar bet. i guess you could win a drink. i used a rotary phone too.  person1:I have a sort of useful fact about phones! The cables carrying phone and internet data across oceans are only 2.7 inches in diameter and just lay on the ocean floor! That doesn't sound very reliable, but seems to be working.  person2:i think that it is probably pretty sturdy. plus it is way down on the bottom of the sea. nothing lives there except maybe tiny creatures.  person1:Hm, another probably not-so-interesting fact, an iPhone has more computing power than the entire US nuclear ICBM deterrent. Do you have an iPhone? person2:no i dont. coincidentally i do have an ICBM deterrent. person1:Haha! I don't have an iPhone either. Too expensive for my taste (or wallet)! person2:too expensive. the icbm deterrent has text messaging, which is good enough for me.  person1:Apparently, Unicef will donate a day of clean water to a child in need for every minute you don't use your cell phone.

I read there is a running back who used to play for the patriots then never fumbled!  That is crazy!  This guy should be more popular,  I never heard of him,  Benjarvus Green- Ellis.  person2:Watching the Eagles now!  Hope they win:)  If they win with a score of 223 or higher, they'll beat the record for the highest scoring football game over the old record of Georgia Tech in 1916 person1:I saw that somewhere,  amazing!  Good job Georgia Tech!  I can;t believe bowlers use to make twice as much as football players in the sixties!  Thats insane,  bowling must have been super popular at that time!  person2:That is crazy.  Do you ever see the yellow line?  ESPN Created it person1:Yeah and won an award for it.   person2:Do you like baseball?  A married couple scheduled all the games up until 2005.  In fact they scheduled 2430 games. person1:That is a lot of time dedicated to baseball lol I hope they got paid!  It is nice when couples have a hobby that they are so passionate about though.   person2:Sure is!  If you like to watch football as a couple, then you really only need 11 minutes to watch live gameplay.  But, you probably spend a few hours. person1:lol but you have to spend like 3 hours to watch that 11 minutes of gameplay though.... person2:Yep that's exactly what I said.  Did you hear about the man who found lots of 1900's baseball cards in his grandfathers attic?  They were hidden since 1940's.  Do you know how much they were worth? person1:Not really,  you said you only need 11 min to watch the gameplay.  That was confusing.  Yeah I read about that,  I think it was 3 billion.  or around there.  person2:$3 million in fact.  That's a lot of cash!  If you are a cheerleader for the New Orleans Saints, you have to leave a restaurant if an NFL player comes in after you.  That stinks. person1:That seems really rude.  But I get it,  they aren't suppose to interact with football players.  I think they have a crappy job though,  they have to pay for their own travel expenses and now they have to leave a restaurant if a football player comes in,  what if they are not done eating.  sad.  person2:They should get reimbursed by the NFL for the meal then or have the NFL player pay for it. person1:They should!  But who knows.  i just learned that women can play in the nfl!  I didn't know that before1 person2:There is no rule against it.  I never thought they couldn't.  I just didn't think anyone made it that far that was female.  Probably there have been more than a share of obstacles to get there.  Nice thing is that if you are an engineer, chances are you will make more average lifetime earnings than that of the average lifetime earnings of an nfl player or mlb player person1:That's great for the engineer!  Seems a little weird though because football players risk they health and safety all the time.   person2:It is a very dangerous sport.

I'm kind of sad to see them go since I'm from that area,though I cannot say I'm a fan. person1:Many fans must be sad, they will gain new fans on the plus side and maybe their drough will be over, changing cities can be a good thing, the stadium must be really nice person2:It seems like it's still unclear as to where the Raiders will play in 2019 person1:It seems like a college stadium is a likely fit for the team, its a complicated issue, lets hope the stadium is ready quickly person2:Yeah, it really is a complicated matter. The city is expected to file an antitrust lawsuit over the Raiders' move to Las Vegas. person1:It seems like a long fight, that will take a lot of time to settle, the lawsuit has to materialize yet so maybe they wont find enough to keep it person2:The Chronicle thinks it will happen. However, the Raiders probably do not hold a great hand. person1:Yeah it seems like they broke an agreement, they should have thought twice before changing cities. person2:Yeah there are a bunch of reasons why it can't be in the Bay Area or Las Vegas so we shall see. person1:Yeah, so you said youre not really into fooball but do you have a favorite team? person2:I just like teams from the bay area, haha. That would be the Raiders and 49ers. How about you? person1:I see lol, well mine is in the AFC, and just won the Superbowl,can you guess what team im talking about? person2:The Patriots, yes they are an awesome team! It's interesting how much technology there is in football today. There are tracking chips in shoulder pads and footballs. person1:Yeah the Patriots, thats my favorite team and it is interesting! technology has advanced so much that chips can tell us all kinds of cool stats about the game person2:Yeah. Espn's yellow line helps me out a bit. They even won an Emmy for that. person1:Do you think ESPN deserved an emmy for that?  person2:Haha, not sure.

And this is not the first time he responds like that. person2:Oh I didn't know that, when did he do it before? person1:Almost most of the time he is being interview. That\u00b4s why the reporter said: We got it weeks ago, with the exasperated sighs and snarky responses that come whenever you face reporters' questions\u00a8 person2:Oh yes, that's true but at least that's not as explosive as he behaved with Maria Taylor recently. person1:Really?! What did he did to her? Haven't heard about it. person2:He snapped at her, and gave an abrasive response to a fair question. person1:Wow!! That\u00b4s way too much. Don\u00b4t you think he should be suspended? person2:I'm not sure, he did apologize at least but I am not so familiar with the context of how they usually punish off the field behavior like that. I guess some sort of penalty would be fair, but maybe not a whole suspension? person1:You are kind of right, but definitely something underneath is going on with him. person2:I guess, maybe I don't think it's the big of deal to be upset as long as you acknowledge that it was wrong. A bit of anger can be healthy.  person1:And I have to admit that the reporter was pushing him a little bit.", "ours": {"generated": " person2: Oh, I see.
