Yeah apparently lol! They do that instead of hiring people to mow!|(mowing,no)|{'mowing': 'negative'}
TARGET RESPONSE: thats both funny and i guess imaginative. leave it to a huge tech company to employ actual goats!
Yeah exactly I am sure they are cheaper. One thing I bet they couldn't exploit is fish. I think fish are so cool there is actually a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.|(technology,yes)|(goats,yes)|{'technology': 'positive', 'goats': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: i had rememered hearing about that before. Immortatlity is wasted on a jellyfish haha. did you know a seahorse is the only fish that has an actual neck?
That is so funny I guess I never considered a seahorse a fish. The black swallower fish sounds a lot like a snake because it can eat pray that is so large.|(animals,yes)|(seahorse,yes)|{'animals': 'positive', 'seahorse': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: i guess they live up to their name then!
It seems they do. I also didn't know that there was a difference with how freshwater and saltwater fish drink.|(food,yes)|(sushi,yes)|{'food': 'positive', 'sushi': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: thats crazy. i wonder why fresh water ones only use osmosis? 
Yeah and saltwater fish are lucky because they can do that and drink through their mouth's.|(water,yes)|(osmosis,yes)|{'water': 'positive', 'osmosis': 'positive'}

He was indeed, his music is even in the library of congress.|(music,yes)|(Tupac,yes)|{'music': 'positive', 'Tupac': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: I didn't know this thanks for sharing.
Sure thing!  Did you hear about Michael Jackson's special patent shoes?|(fashion,yes)|(Michael Jackson,yes)|{'fashion': 'positive', 'Michael Jackson': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: No. I know that Michael Jackson was a fantastic dancer but can you tell me more about his patent shoes if you don't mind.
There was a specific device in his shoes that helped with his extreme lean in some dance moves.|(music,yes)|(dancing,unknown)|{'music': 'positive', 'dancing': 'unknown'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Wow!!! That is amazing coming from such a talented singer and dancer. I couldn't even dance like that even if I dreamed of it.
Me neither. I could never be a professional dancer.|(dancing,no)|{'dancing': 'negative'}
TARGET RESPONSE: I heard that some professional ballet dancer can go through four pairs of shoes in a week.
That is crazy!  That can't be cheap for them.|(shopping,yes)|(cost,unknown)|{'shopping': 'positive', 'cost': 'unknown'}

TARGET RESPONSE: Yes, I think it is the most effective search engine. How about you? Do you use gmail?

TARGET RESPONSE: And before on Google moon they used to use cheese for close ups!
do you know how google maps calculates traffic?|(news,yes)|(traffic,unknown)|{'news': 'positive', 'traffic': 'unknown'}
TARGET RESPONSE: I am not sure, how do they do this?
they track how fast android devices are moving|(technology,yes)|(smartphone tracking,yes)|{'technology': 'positive', 'smartphone tracking': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Interesting! Google really is taking over the world. Their data center electricity use is 0.01 percent of all worldwide electricity.
Yes for sure they are. they have grown so much over the years|(technology,yes)|(Google,yes)|{'technology': 'positive', 'Google': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: But I like that they like to have fun too. Have you ever typed askew into Google?
No I have. What does the results turn?|(search,yes)|(Google results,unknown)|{'search': 'positive', 'Google results': 'unknown'}
TARGET RESPONSE: You should try it! It tilts the page. Another fun thing Google does is call new employees nogglers. They have to wear propeller beanies. Or is this mean?
Oh, not sure about that really. People say it is a great place to work at though|(work,yes)|(job rules,unknown)|{'work': 'positive', 'job rules': 'unknown'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Before Google launched gmail, that was the name of a free email service offered by garfield's website. That actually seems more fun.
I know now everytime I open gmail I think of garfield|(technology,yes)|(gmail,yes)|{'technology': 'positive', 'gmail': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Speaking of cats, I would love to get a glow in the dark one. They have those in South Korea.
Wow. In Japana and Taiwan there are cat cafes where you can play with them|(cat,yes)|(cat cafes,yes)|{'cat': 'positive', 'cat cafes': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: That seems fun! That reminds me of the Anderson house bed and breakfast in Minnesota. They used to offer a free cat for the night when you booked a room.
wow. there is a town in alaska where the mayor of the town is a cat|(pets,yes)|(cat,yes)|{'pets': 'positive', 'cat': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: That is cool. Cats are a pretty smart species. There has not been a cat species extinction in 10,000 years.
They are indeed very smart and that proves it. Nice chatting with you.|(conversation,yes)|{'conversation': 'positive'}
Do you like comic books?|(books,yes)|(comic books,yes)|{'books': 'positive', 'comic books': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: I do like comic books!
Have you heard that Harley Quinn has a new comic book series coming out?|(books,yes)|(Harley Quinn,yes)|{'books': 'positive', 'Harley Quinn': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: I have not heard that.  I know that comic book legend Stan Lee used to end every phone conversation with "excelsior!"
I've heard that too. Did you know that the DC in DC comics stands for Detective Comics?|(comics,yes)|(Detective Comics,yes)|{'comics': 'positive', 'Detective Comics': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: I just read that today.  The largest comic book market is in Japan.  I believe it.  My son loves to read those mangas.
I would love to go there. I used to like reading Manga too. |(books,yes)|(mangas,yes)|{'books': 'positive', 'mangas': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: The manga market is Japan is valued at $6 to $7 billion dollars!
That is wild! Did you know that Michigan State University library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world?|(books,yes)|(collecting,yes)|{'books': 'positive', 'collecting': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: I didn't know that.  I wonder how many people use it.  By comparison to Japan, the US comic book market in the US and Canada is $1.09 billion!
That's crazy, Japan is way more into comic books than America it seems. |(comic books,yes)|(Japan,yes)|{'comic books': 'positive', 'Japan': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: I agree!  The Marvel cinematic universe takes place in earth -199999, a multiverse different from the original comic book multiverse, earth-616!
That's pretty wild. Marvel published a "generic comic book," in order to trademark the names "superhero" and "super-villain." That was pretty smart of them. |(entertainment,yes)|(Marvel,yes)|{'entertainment': 'positive', 'Marvel': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: No doubt!  Do you know much about the planets or the universe?
I know a little bit. I've heard that Venus does not tilt. |(astronomy,yes)|(planets,unknown)|{'astronomy': 'positive', 'planets': 'unknown'}
TARGET RESPONSE: That interesting.  Uranus is different to.  It actually rotates sideways and rolls around the sun rather than spins like the other planets.
That's really interesting. I've also heard that Jupiter's moon Ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun. |(astronomy,yes)|(Jupiter's moon Ganymede,yes)|{'astronomy': 'positive', "Jupiter's moon Ganymede": 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: It must be pretty big then!  I wouldn't want to ever visit the unnamed planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph!
I don't see that being a pleasant place. It's even 2000 degree weather. That sounds like hell to me!|(weather,no)|{'weather': 'negative'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Hahah That's a good way of putting it! 
Well I have to get to work, I hope you have a good day. It was nice chatting with you!|(work,no)|{'work': 'negative'}
Can you believe there is stars that can be cold enough to be touched ? The universe is so diverse. |(astronomy,yes)|(stargazing,yes)|{'astronomy': 'positive', 'stargazing': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Its amazing and ever evolving. 
Yeah and there is even places that exist but we never will be able to see because they are too far away. |(travel,yes)|(places,yes)|{'travel': 'positive', 'places': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: They are saying space pulls galaxies outside of universe that we could see
Yes that is what I was saying, albeit I doubt that there is only one electron in the universe like some people say. |(astronomy,yes)|(electron,unknown)|{'astronomy': 'positive', 'electron': 'unknown'}
TARGET RESPONSE: I don't see anything supporting or denying that theory so we would never know for sure. 
Yeah, but only one ? For all the universe ? It does not seems logic ...|(astronomy,no)|(universe,no)|{'astronomy': 'negative', 'universe': 'negative'}
TARGET RESPONSE: There is only one sun that warms earth and all other planets so why not just one electron? 
Because an electron is part of matter, the water you drink, the chair you sit on. Saying there is only 1 electron in the universe is like saying there is 1 grain of wheat in your bread.  |(science,yes)|(electron,yes)|{'science': 'positive', 'electron': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: It makes sense when you put it that way but in terms of that universe size the electron could be very big.
Maybe they did mean to say that our universe is contained in an electron in another universe ?|(science,yes)|(quantum mechanics,unknown)|{'science': 'positive', 'quantum mechanics': 'unknown'}
TARGET RESPONSE: I don't know but I am at the end of knowledge on this subject. What do you think about the facts of comics? I would have thought US invented them, but it's Japan or UK.
Japan has a great printing history, I am not surprised about this. Do you read comics books ? I have read a few but not about super-heroes. |(books,yes)|(super-heroes,no)|{'books': 'positive', 'super-heroes': 'negative'}
TARGET RESPONSE: I used to in my childhood but not any more, I used to love inspector Gadget. 
Was Inspect Gadget a comics on Paper or a cartoon on TV ? I was talking about what Marvel is publishing.|(entertainment,yes)|(Marvel,yes)|{'entertainment': 'positive', 'Marvel': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: On Paper and yes I do recall seeing Super-hero and Hulk books.
I think that Hulk is in the Marvel universe. But like I said, I never read anything from Marvel nor DC comics. |(books,yes)|(Marvel,yes)|{'books': 'positive', 'Marvel': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Right me neither, there were so many good choices of comics when I was growing up. 
Not where I lived, if I want to read a comic book, I had to go to the library. But as I think about it Tintin is a comic book, so I was wrong, I did read a lot of them when I was young but they were European.  |(books,yes)|(Tintin,yes)|{'books': 'positive', 'Tintin': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Mine all time favorite was Bozo the clown, books and TV both. 
I did saw a lot of cartoons on TV, but I don't think that considered as a comic book. have a nice day. |(entertainment,yes)|(comics,no)|{'entertainment': 'positive', 'comics': 'negative'}
Are you a Star Wars fan? I need to rewatch the OT and the prequels so I can watch the subsequent stuff for the first time and understand what's going on.|(movie,yes)|(Star Wars,yes)|{'movie': 'positive', 'Star Wars': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Hi! Yes, I am a huge fan of Star Wars! I also loved how it was the first major movie to be dubbed in Navajo! I think that is so cool!
Yeah, that's wild. I guess it takes a pretty small audience to pay for the translation work.|(movie,yes)|(Star Wars,yes)|{'movie': 'positive', 'Star Wars': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Agreed. Isn't it also funny James Earl Jones only spent two and half hours recording his lines for Darth Vader? I also can't believe he was only paid $7500! Geez, that's pocket change.
$7500 is amazingly low. I guess since Darth Vader was masked Jones could just record everything at once in the studio.|(movie,yes)|(James Earl Jones,yes)|{'movie': 'positive', 'James Earl Jones': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Agreed. Can you also believe that George Lucas' wife at the time, Marcia, won an academy award for her editing on Star Wars and yet George Lucas didn't win an academy award for directing. That is just downright unbelievable!
A lot of people think the OT was so much better than the prequels because of her influence.|(movie,yes)|(movie awards,yes)|{'movie': 'positive', 'movie awards': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Yeah it was because of her that so many major changes were made like Leia's good luck kiss, Obi Wan's death, etc. She was truly a big influence!
I remember thinking just about everything in the prequels' timeline was off, based on the mental version of the past the OT led us to construct. But I'd have to rewatch to nail it down.|(movie,yes)|(Star Wars continuity,yes)|{'movie': 'positive', 'Star Wars continuity': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Yeah I would have to watch it as well! So are you also a fan of Chewbacca? I love him. I think it's funny there's a bat species called the Chewbacca bat. That's hilarious!
I never felt strongly about Chewbacca one way or the other TBH. But I've got to google a picture of that bat to see what it looks like!|(movie,yes)|(Chewbacca,yes)|{'movie': 'positive', 'Chewbacca': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: I would like to see it as well. Did you know Chewbacca actually had a wife and two boys? That's pretty interesting!
I vaguely recall reading something in the Star Wars fictional universe where a young Han Solo stayed with Chewbacca and his mom in their home.|(movie,yes)|(movie plot,yes)|{'movie': 'positive', 'movie plot': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: That's so weird, isn't it? Ha! Are you one of the fans who believes both r2d2 and Chewbacca were secret rebel agents? I kind of think it's an interesting theory. 
I wish I knew enough about the background to have an opinion, but the last Star Wars I watched was Episode III, when it came out on video. I really need to rewatch to refresh my memory of it. |(movie,yes)|(Star Wars theories,yes)|{'movie': 'positive', 'Star Wars theories': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Same here! Like, I also had forgotten that before his companionship with Chewbacca, Hans Solo was an imperial lieutenant!
Yeah, I don't remember that at all. He definitely doesn't seem like the type.|(movie,yes)|(movie character,unknown)|{'movie': 'positive', 'movie character': 'unknown'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Indeed he doesn't. But I've always liked Chewbacca because he reminded me of a giant dog. Ha! Speaking of dogs, I think it's cool that dogs, along with elephants, are the only animals that understand pointing!
I wouldn't be surprised if cats understood it but just didn't care, LOL.|(animals,yes)|(dogs,yes)|{'animals': 'positive', 'dogs': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Ha! No kidding. Speaking of dogs and cats, I like how Google prefers dogs over cats and even states in their code of conduct that they're a dog company! That is awesome!
Yeah, that's a weird official policy for what's supposed to be a neutral search engine! Nice chatting with you.|(conversation,yes)|(dog,yes)|{'conversation': 'positive', 'dog': 'positive'}
Naming a cloned cat "copy cat", that's cute.|(cat,yes)|(cat name,yes)|{'cat': 'positive', 'cat name': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: You must have ESP. I was going to tell you teh same thing! I have a sad story to tell there are less tigers living in the wild in Asia than as pets in the US.
Really? That's awful to hear!|(environment,yes)|(wildlife,yes)|{'environment': 'positive', 'wildlife': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Of Roosevelt's 20 pets two were a bear and hyena!
Whoa, cool! I know he seemed to be quite the animal lover.|(pets,yes)|(favorite animal,yes)|{'pets': 'positive', 'favorite animal': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: And there are more pets in Japan than there are children under 15. You can't be a pets "OWNER" in Boulder but you can be their guardian.  
I have a pet. I am an ailurophile meaning I love cats.|(pets,yes)|(cat,yes)|{'pets': 'positive', 'cat': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Cool word! Did you know there are 20 quintillion animal varieties on Earth?
That is a lot! And in 2002 Germany gave them legal rights.|(animals,yes)|(legal rights,yes)|{'animals': 'positive', 'legal rights': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Yeah, and the Loch Ness monster is protected under the 1912 Scottish Animal Protection Act.
I wonder if the immortal jellyfish needs protecting... being immortal and all.|(animals,yes)|(Loch Ness,yes)|{'animals': 'positive', 'Loch Ness': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Lol...speaking of water animals, did you know that hiccoughs are a left over from evolution when we had gills?
Maybe that connection is part of why 84% of human disease genes have counterparts in zebrafish, too... hmm.|(animals,yes)|(hiccoughs,unknown)|{'animals': 'positive', 'hiccoughs': 'unknown'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Hmm? Good theory. Seeing that the most popular pets are cats and dogs it is no surprise that they are commonly used for therapy in hospitals.
Well, they are good at helping people adjust to new situations, too.|(pets,yes)|(cat and dog therapy,yes)|{'pets': 'positive', 'cat and dog therapy': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Yes, like for elderly who are without companions.
Or people with anxiety and depression, or kids with autism.|(career,yes)|(job satisfaction,yes)|{'career': 'positive', 'job satisfaction': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Yes, a seahorse wouldn't be very good for that purpose. Did you know seahorses are the only fish with a neck?
I don't think a black swallower fish would be good as a companion pet either because it can eat prey twice its length!|(pets,yes)|(seafood,no)|{'pets': 'positive', 'seafood': 'negative'}
TARGET RESPONSE: That would freak me out! But I bet it catches that prey using its acoustic communication!
Could be. Fish are cool like that. I think it's neat that amphibians and reptiles and birds and mammals all had the same ancestry with fish.|(animals,yes)|(fish,yes)|{'animals': 'positive', 'fish': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: I wonder if reptiles are considered ectothermic like most fish?
That would be a good thing to know, especially because some of them make good pets.|(animals,yes)|(pet,yes)|{'animals': 'positive', 'pet': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Yep, but I don't know if walking a gecko would give the same health benefits as walking a dog
Probably not. Dog walking is good because it gives companionship and exercise at the same time.|(hobbies,yes)|(dog walking,yes)|{'hobbies': 'positive', 'dog walking': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Hey, did you know the first marine predator was the shark? They developed in the Silurian period.
Very interesting. I wonder how many aquatic species have gone extinct since then...|(animals,yes)|(shark,yes)|{'animals': 'positive', 'shark': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Or have evolved into other species. The shark has a higher core temperature than other fish because it is an active swimmer.
That makes sense. I always thought sharks were pretty interesting because they have cartilage instead of bone.|(animals,yes)|(shark,yes)|{'animals': 'positive', 'shark': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Yes, fascinating fact! Tuna also hold a higher core temperature. They are in the same class as shark because they are also active swimmers.
Tuna can get quite large, too. It's cool how big some fish get.|(fitness,yes)|(swimming,yes)|{'fitness': 'positive', 'swimming': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: One more before we go...did you know domesticated animals develop a white patch on their forehead?
Yeah. that is a pretty cool way to know they are domesticated rather than wild.|(animals,yes)|(headache,yes)|{'animals': 'positive', 'headache': 'positive'}
TARGET RESPONSE: Very cool chatting with you. Did you know there are 6331 groups of genes? They are common to all living animals!
It was a cool exercise in zoology chatting with you.|(general,yes)|(genes,yes)|{'general': 'positive', 'genes': 'positive'}
