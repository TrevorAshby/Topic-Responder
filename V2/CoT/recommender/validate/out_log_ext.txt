That's crazy, Japan is way more into comic books than America it seems. |(comic books,yes)|(Japan,yes)|{'comic books': 'positive', 'Japan': 'positive'}|manga adaptations,anime festivals,comic book adaptations

TARGET RESPONSE: I agree!  The Marvel cinematic universe takes place in earth -199999, a multiverse different from the original comic book multiverse, earth-616!
That's pretty wild. Marvel published a "generic comic book," in order to trademark the names "superhero" and "super-villain." That was pretty smart of them. |(entertainment,yes)|(Marvel,yes)|{'entertainment': 'positive', 'Marvel': 'positive'}|movie adaptations,animal rights,film adaptations

I know a little bit. I've heard that Venus does not tilt. |(astronomy,yes)|(planets,unknown)|{'astronomy': 'positive', 'planets': 'unknown'}|astronautic discoveries,space science,astronomy education

TARGET RESPONSE: I don't see anything supporting or denying that theory so we would never know for sure. 
Yeah, but only one ? For all the universe ? It does not seems logic ...|(astronomy,no)|(universe,no)|{'astronomy': 'negative', 'universe': 'negative'}|space missions,cosmic mysteries,cosmic mysteries

TARGET RESPONSE: There is only one sun that warms earth and all other planets so why not just one electron? 
Because an electron is part of matter, the water you drink, the chair you sit on. Saying there is only 1 electron in the universe is like saying there is 1 grain of wheat in your bread.  |(science,yes)|(electron,yes)|{'science': 'positive', 'electron': 'positive'}|electron research,science communication,electron beams

TARGET RESPONSE: It makes sense when you put it that way but in terms of that universe size the electron could be very big.
Maybe they did mean to say that our universe is contained in an electron in another universe ?|(science,yes)|(quantum mechanics,unknown)|{'science': 'positive', 'quantum mechanics': 'unknown'}|quantum mechanics,physics education,quantum computers

TARGET RESPONSE: I don't know but I am at the end of knowledge on this subject. What do you think about the facts of comics? I would have thought US invented them, but it's Japan or UK.
Japan has a great printing history, I am not surprised about this. Do you read comics books ? I have read a few but not about super-heroes. |(books,yes)|(super-heroes,no)|{'books': 'positive', 'super-heroes': 'negative'}|book adaptations,superhero movies,book adaptations

I think that Hulk is in the Marvel universe. But like I said, I never read anything from Marvel nor DC comics. |(books,yes)|(Marvel,yes)|{'books': 'positive', 'Marvel': 'positive'}|Marvel movies,books,books clubs

TARGET RESPONSE: Right me neither, there were so many good choices of comics when I was growing up. 
Not where I lived, if I want to read a comic book, I had to go to the library. But as I think about it Tintin is a comic book, so I was wrong, I did read a lot of them when I was young but they were European.  |(books,yes)|(Tintin,yes)|{'books': 'positive', 'Tintin': 'positive'}|book clubs,book recommendations,book adaptations

TARGET RESPONSE: Hi! Yes, I am a huge fan of Star Wars! I also loved how it was the first major movie to be dubbed in Navajo! I think that is so cool!
Yeah, that's wild. I guess it takes a pretty small audience to pay for the translation work.|(movie,yes)|(Star Wars,yes)|{'movie': 'positive', 'Star Wars': 'positive'}|movie reviews,star trek,film adaptations

TARGET RESPONSE: Agreed. Isn't it also funny James Earl Jones only spent two and half hours recording his lines for Darth Vader? I also can't believe he was only paid $7500! Geez, that's pocket change.
$7500 is amazingly low. I guess since Darth Vader was masked Jones could just record everything at once in the studio.|(movie,yes)|(James Earl Jones,yes)|{'movie': 'positive', 'James Earl Jones': 'positive'}|movie reviews,music appreciation,musical influences

TARGET RESPONSE: Agreed. Can you also believe that George Lucas' wife at the time, Marcia, won an academy award for her editing on Star Wars and yet George Lucas didn't win an academy award for directing. That is just downright unbelievable!
A lot of people think the OT was so much better than the prequels because of her influence.|(movie,yes)|(movie awards,yes)|{'movie': 'positive', 'movie awards': 'positive'}|movie reviews,movie festivals,movie reviews

TARGET RESPONSE: Yeah it was because of her that so many major changes were made like Leia's good luck kiss, Obi Wan's death, etc. She was truly a big influence!
I remember thinking just about everything in the prequels' timeline was off, based on the mental version of the past the OT led us to construct. But I'd have to rewatch to nail it down.|(movie,yes)|(Star Wars continuity,yes)|{'movie': 'positive', 'Star Wars continuity': 'positive'}|Star Wars movies,film adaptations,Star Wars fandom

I vaguely recall reading something in the Star Wars fictional universe where a young Han Solo stayed with Chewbacca and his mom in their home.|(movie,yes)|(movie plot,yes)|{'movie': 'positive', 'movie plot': 'positive'}|movie reviews,movie adaptations,movie trailers

TARGET RESPONSE: That's so weird, isn't it? Ha! Are you one of the fans who believes both r2d2 and Chewbacca were secret rebel agents? I kind of think it's an interesting theory. 
I wish I knew enough about the background to have an opinion, but the last Star Wars I watched was Episode III, when it came out on video. I really need to rewatch to refresh my memory of it. |(movie,yes)|(Star Wars theories,yes)|{'movie': 'positive', 'Star Wars theories': 'positive'}|Star Wars movies,film adaptations,Star Wars fandom

Yeah, I don't remember that at all. He definitely doesn't seem like the type.|(movie,yes)|(movie character,unknown)|{'movie': 'positive', 'movie character': 'unknown'}|movie reviews,movie quotes,movie trailers

TARGET RESPONSE: Indeed he doesn't. But I've always liked Chewbacca because he reminded me of a giant dog. Ha! Speaking of dogs, I think it's cool that dogs, along with elephants, are the only animals that understand pointing!
I wouldn't be surprised if cats understood it but just didn't care, LOL.|(animals,yes)|(dogs,yes)|{'animals': 'positive', 'dogs': 'positive'}|dog training,pet care,animal welfare

TARGET RESPONSE: Ha! No kidding. Speaking of dogs and cats, I like how Google prefers dogs over cats and even states in their code of conduct that they're a dog company! That is awesome!

Maybe that connection is part of why 84% of human disease genes have counterparts in zebrafish, too... hmm.|(animals,yes)|(hiccoughs,unknown)|{'animals': 'positive', 'hiccoughs': 'unknown'}|animal welfare,sick animals,animal welfare

TARGET RESPONSE: Hmm? Good theory. Seeing that the most popular pets are cats and dogs it is no surprise that they are commonly used for therapy in hospitals.
Well, they are good at helping people adjust to new situations, too.|(pets,yes)|(cat and dog therapy,yes)|{'pets': 'positive', 'cat and dog therapy': 'positive'}|pet care,pet adoption,pet adoption

TARGET RESPONSE: Yes, like for elderly who are without companions.
Or people with anxiety and depression, or kids with autism.|(career,yes)|(job satisfaction,yes)|{'career': 'positive', 'job satisfaction': 'positive'}|career opportunities,workplace satisfaction,successful relationships

TARGET RESPONSE: Yes, a seahorse wouldn't be very good for that purpose. Did you know seahorses are the only fish with a neck?
I don't think a black swallower fish would be good as a companion pet either because it can eat prey twice its length!|(pets,yes)|(seafood,no)|{'pets': 'positive', 'seafood': 'negative'}|seafood,pet care,fisheries,seafood ethics

TARGET RESPONSE: That would freak me out! But I bet it catches that prey using its acoustic communication!
Could be. Fish are cool like that. I think it's neat that amphibians and reptiles and birds and mammals all had the same ancestry with fish.|(animals,yes)|(fish,yes)|{'animals': 'positive', 'fish': 'positive'}|fish care,fish conservation,fisheries,fisheries management

TARGET RESPONSE: I wonder if reptiles are considered ectothermic like most fish?
That would be a good thing to know, especially because some of them make good pets.|(animals,yes)|(pet,yes)|{'animals': 'positive', 'pet': 'positive'}|pet care,animal welfare,pet adoption

TARGET RESPONSE: Yep, but I don't know if walking a gecko would give the same health benefits as walking a dog
Probably not. Dog walking is good because it gives companionship and exercise at the same time.|(hobbies,yes)|(dog walking,yes)|{'hobbies': 'positive', 'dog walking': 'positive'}|dog training,dog care,dog training

TARGET RESPONSE: Hey, did you know the first marine predator was the shark? They developed in the Silurian period.
Very interesting. I wonder how many aquatic species have gone extinct since then...|(animals,yes)|(shark,yes)|{'animals': 'positive', 'shark': 'positive'}|shark care,fisheries,shark conservation

TARGET RESPONSE: Or have evolved into other species. The shark has a higher core temperature than other fish because it is an active swimmer.
That makes sense. I always thought sharks were pretty interesting because they have cartilage instead of bone.|(animals,yes)|(shark,yes)|{'animals': 'positive', 'shark': 'positive'}|shark care,fisheries,shark conservation

TARGET RESPONSE: Yes, fascinating fact! Tuna also hold a higher core temperature. They are in the same class as shark because they are also active swimmers.
Tuna can get quite large, too. It's cool how big some fish get.|(fitness,yes)|(swimming,yes)|{'fitness': 'positive', 'swimming': 'positive'}|swimming tips,fitness challenges,swimwear

TARGET RESPONSE: One more before we go...did you know domesticated animals develop a white patch on their forehead?
Yeah. that is a pretty cool way to know they are domesticated rather than wild.|(animals,yes)|(headache,yes)|{'animals': 'positive', 'headache': 'positive'}|animal welfare,medical issues,healing techniques

TARGET RESPONSE: Very cool chatting with you. Did you know there are 6331 groups of genes? They are common to all living animals!
It was a cool exercise in zoology chatting with you.|(general,yes)|(genes,yes)|{'general': 'positive', 'genes': 'positive'}|asian cultures,biodiversity,scientific discoveries
